Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment

for distribution of the Further Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Further Notes (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to

EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or

forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

**_General Information on Financial Statements_**

Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information in this Information Memorandum relating to TIM
and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “TIM Group” or the “Group”) has been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements of the TIM Group as of and for the financial years ended 31 December
2022, 2021 and 2020 (the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The Issuer’s financial year ends on 31 December, and references in this Information Memorandum to
any specific year are to the twelve-month period ended on 31 December of such year. The Issuer’s
independent auditors, EY S.p.A., have been appointed for the nine-year period spanning 2019-2027.

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by
the EU (“IFRS”).

In 2022, the TIM Group applied the accounting policies on a basis consistent with those of the previous
years, except for the changes to the accounting standards issued by the IASB and in force as of 1 January
2022 and described in the section “New standards and interpretations endorsed by EU and in force
_from 1 January 2022” of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended_
31 December 2022, incorporated by reference herein.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, TIM refined some aspects of the booking of certain commercial
agreements concerning the sale of goods with deferred delivery. This refinement entailed, for the first,
second and third quarters of 2021, the redetermination of the distribution over time of revenues and
acquisition of goods and services. In connection with the foregoing, the economic data of the first,
second and third quarters of 2021, has been recalculated. For further detail, please see the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021, incorporated by
reference herein.

On 1 January 2019, IFRS 16 (Leases) (“IFRS 16”) became effective and was adopted by the TIM Group
with the modified retrospective method (without the restatement of comparative financial information
of previous years), fully replacing IAS 17 (Leases). In accordance with IFRS 16, lease liabilities are
presented through the recognition of a financial liability in the statement of financial position consisting
in the present value of future lease payments, against the recognition of the right of use of the leased

ix


-----

asset. The application of IFRS 16 determines lower operating costs and higher
amortisation/depreciation and financial charges in comparison with IAS 17 which required the
recognition of operating costs for non-financial leases. Further details are provided in the Note
“Accounting Policies” to the TIM Group Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the
year ended 31 December 2020. See also _“—Alternative Performance Measures—Alternative_
_Performance Measures after lease” below._

**_Appendix 1 – Overview of Key Operating and Financial Data for the Year ended 31 December 2022_**

Appendix 1 contains an overview of certain key operating and financial data as at and for the year ended
31 December 2022 and is based on the information included in the Report on operations of the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022.

**_Appendix 2 – Overview of Key Operating and Financial Data for the Year ended 31 December 2021_**

Appendix 2 contains an overview of certain key operating and financial data as at and for the year ended
31 December 2021 and is based on the information included in the Report on operations of the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021.

**_Appendix 3 – Overview of Key Operating and Financial Data for the Year ended 31 December 2020_**

Appendix 3 contains an overview of certain key operating and financial data as at and for the year ended
31 December 2020 and is based on the information included in the Report on operations of the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020.

**_Industry and market Data_**

In this Information Memorandum, the Issuer relies on and refers to information regarding the Group’s
business and the markets in which it operates and competes. The market data and certain economic and
industry data and forecasts used in this Information Memorandum were obtained from internal surveys,
market research, governmental reports and other publicly-available information and third party
consultants.

In addition, in many cases, the Issuer has made statements in this Information Memorandum regarding
the economy, the telecommunications industry, the Group’s position in the industry, its market share
and the market shares of various industry participants based on internal estimates, its experience, its
own investigation of market conditions and its review of industry publications, including information
made available to the public by its competitors.

The Issuer cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying these statements are accurate or
correctly reflect the Group’s position in the industry and none of its internal surveys or information has
been verified by any independent third parties. None of the Issuer, any other member of the Group or
the Physical Bookrunner makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of
this information.

The subscriber data included in this Information Memorandum, including penetration rates, average
mobile revenue per user (“ARPU”), subscriber numbers, the Group’s market share and churn rates are
derived from management estimates, are not part of the Issuer’s or the Group’s financial statements or
financial accounting records and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors,
consultants or experts. The Issuer’s use or computation of the terms ARPU or churn may not be
comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies in the
telecommunications industry. ARPU is a non-IFRS measure and should not be considered in isolation
or as an alternative measure of the Issuer’s or the Group’s performance under IFRS. Management
believes that ARPU provides useful information concerning the appeal and usage patterns of the

x


-----

Group’s tariff plans and service offerings and its performance in attracting and retaining high-value
subscribers of its services.

**_Churn_**

“Churn” refers to the percentage of subscriber disconnections. The Group deems mobile subscribers to
have churned when their mobile service with us is disconnected (whether resulting from a subscriber
decision or a decision by the Group).

The Group calculates the churn rate by dividing the number of disconnections of subscribers during a
period by the average number of subscribers during the same period. The definition of churn may vary
between operators. A churn policy that is more expansive in its determination of when a subscriber is
deemed to have churned may result in a reduction of the number reported for total subscribers, an
increase in churn rate and potentially higher ARPU. As a result, such data and any related comparisons
of the Group to other operators included in this Information Memorandum may not accurately reflect
the Group’s competitive position and the competitive positions of such other operators.

**_Penetration Rates_**

“Penetration” refers to the measurement, usually as a percentage, of the take-up of the relevant
telecommunications services. As of any date, it represents the number of people (or subscribers) who
acquire goods and/or services of a particular brand or a particular category, divided by the population
where the service is available.

**General**

Certain figures and percentages included in this Information Memorandum have been subject to
rounding adjustments; accordingly, figures shown in the same category presented in different tables
may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of
the figures which precede them.

**Alternative Performance Measures**

In addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS, the TIM Group
uses certain alternative performance measures (“APMs” or “Alternative Performance Measures”)
for the purposes of enabling a better understanding of the performance of its operations and its financial
position. These indicators represent a useful unit of measurement for assessing the operating
performance of the Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level).

Such measures should, however, not be considered as a substitute for those prepared in accordance with
IFRS. As these measures are not defined by IFRS, they may be calculated differently from the
alternative performance measures published by other companies and therefore comparability between
companies may be limited.

The Alternative Performance Measures used in this Information Memorandum are described below.

- _EBIT/EBITDA: these indicators are used by TIM as a financial target. These measures are_
calculated as follows:

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations
+ Finance expenses

 - Finance income
+/- Other expenses (income) from investments
+/- Share of losses (profits) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method
EBIT – Operating profit (loss)
+/- Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets

xi


-----

+/- Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets
+ Depreciation and amortization
EBITDA – Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals (losses) on non-current
assets

- _Organic change and impact of the non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these_
measures express changes (amount and/or percentage) in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT,
excluding, where applicable, the effects of the change in the scope of consolidation, the
exchange differences and the non-recurring events and transactions. The TIM Group presents
a reconciliation between the “accounting or reported” figures and the “organic excluding the
non-recurring component”.

- _EBITDA margin and EBIT margin: TIM believes that these margins represent useful indicators_
of the ability of the Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level) to generate profits from its
revenues. In fact, EBITDA margin and EBIT margin measure the operating performance of an
entity by analyzing the percentage of revenues that are converted into EBITDA and EBIT,
respectively.

- _Net Financial Debt: TIM believes that the Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator_
of its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less
Cash and Cash Equivalents and other Financial Assets. The TIM Group presents a table
showing the amounts taken from the statements of financial position and used to calculate the
Net Financial Debt of the Group.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to
the usual indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a
measure called “Adjusted net financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the
volatility of financial markets. Given that some components of the fair value measurement of
derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and of
derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement,
the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-monetary effects
(including the effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of
derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

Net financial debt is calculated as follows:

+ Non-current financial liabilities
+ Current financial liabilities
+ Financial liabilities directly associated with Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale
A) Gross financial debt
+ Non-current financial assets
+ Current financial assets
+ Financial assets relating to Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale
B) Financial assets
C=(A - B) Net financial debt carrying amount
D) Reversal of fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets
E=(C + D) Adjusted Net Financial Debt

- _Equity Free Cash Flow (EFCF): this financial measure represents the free cash flow available_
for the remuneration of own capital, to repay debt and to cover any financial investments and
payments of licenses and frequencies. In particular, the indicator highlights the change in
adjusted net financial debt without considering the impacts of payment of dividends, changes
in equity, acquisitions/disposals of equity investments, outlay for the purchase of licenses and
frequencies, increases/decreases of finance lease liabilities payable (new lease operations,
renewals and/or extensions, cancellations/early extinguishing of leases).

The Equity Free Cash Flow measure is calculated as follows:

xii


-----

Reduction/(Increase) in adjusted net financial debt from continuing operations

Impact for finance leases (new lease operations and/or renewals and/or extensions (-)/any terminations/early extinguishing of leases

+/- (+))

 - Payment of TLC licenses and for the use of frequencies
+/- Financial impact of acquisitions and/or disposals of investments

 - Dividend payment and Change in Equity
Equity Free Cash Flow

- _Capital expenditures (net of spectrum): this financial measure represents capital expenditures_
less capital expenditures on an accrual basis on TLC licenses for the use of frequencies.

**_Alternative Performance Measures after lease_**

The TIM Group presents the following additional alternative performance measures:

- EBITDA After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting EBITDA by the amounts
connected with the accounting treatment of the lease contracts;

- Organic EBITDA After Lease (“Organic **EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic**
EBITDA, net of the non-recurring items, by the amounts connected with the accounting
treatment of the lease contracts;

- Adjusted net financial debt After Lease, calculated by excluding from the adjusted net financial
debt the net liabilities related to the accounting treatment of lease contracts. TIM believes that
the Adjusted net financial debt After Lease represents an indicator of the ability to meet its
financial obligations;

- Equity Free Cash Flow After Lease, calculated by excluding from the Equity Free Cash Flow
the amounts related to lease payments. In particular, this measure is calculated as follows:

+ Equity Free Cash Flow

 - Principal share of lease payments

This measure is a useful indicator of the ability to generate Free Cash Flow.

- _Operating Free Cash Flow (OFCF) and Operating Free Cash Flow (net of licenses): these_
financial measures represents the free cash flow available to repay debt (including leases) and
to cover any financial investments and, in the case of OFCF, payments of licenses and
frequencies. The measures are not adjusted for lease payments.

The Operating Free Cash Flow and Operating Free Cash Flow (net of licenses) measures are calculated
as follows:

EBITDA – Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals (losses) on noncurrent assets

 - Capital expenditures on an accrual basis
+/- Change in working capital (changes in inventories, trade receivables and other net receivables, trade payables, payables for mobile
telephone licenses/spectrum, changes in operating receivables/payables, change in provisions for employee benefits, and operating
provisions and Other changes)
Operating Free Cash flow

 - Payment of TLC licenses and for the use of frequencies
Operating Free Cash flow (net of licenses)

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary may not contain all the information that may be important_ _to prospective_
_investors in the Further Notes. Before making an investment decision, prospective investors should read_
_this entire Information Memorandum,_ _including_ _the “Risk Factors” section_ _and_ _the consolidated_

_Memorandum._

**OVERVIEW**

The Group is a leading information and communications technology (ICT) provider in Italy and Brazil.

TIM offers to individuals and families services and products of mobile and fixed-line telephony,
broadband and pay-TV for communication and entertainment. TIM accompanies small, medium and
large enterprises, including public administrations, towards digitalization through a portfolio of
connectivity and IT services tailored to their needs. TIM is the only infrastructure-based ICT player in
Italy and benefits from a leading position in the Italian IT services market.

The TIM Group 2022-2024 industrial plan (the “2022-2024 Industrial Plan”) announced in March
2022 launched a Group transformation aiming to overcome the vertically integrated model, based on
four separate entities with different industrial and economic focuses. These four entities[1] are:

- _TIM Consumer: covers all the fixed and mobile commercial activities in the Consumer and_
Small and Medium Business (SMB) retail market. It also includes the mobile network assets
and service platforms.

- _TIM Enterprise: includes all the commercial activities in the Enterprise market, the digital_
companies Noovle, Olivetti and Telsy and the assets relating to the data centers.

- _TIM NetCo: includes the primary and secondary fixed network, as well as the domestic and_
international (Sparkle) wholesale businesses.

- _TIM Brasil: a major subsidiary of TIM, is one of the main players in the South American_
telecommunications market and a leader in 4G coverage in that market.

The TIM Group Business Units described in the section “The Issuer” below (Domestic Business Unit,
Brasil Business Unit and Other Operations Business Unit) are presented in line with the 2022 TIM
Annual Report. As such, in such section, the Group’s telecommunications business is presented
geographically (i.e. Domestic and Brasil) and not in terms of the new organisational model to be
implemented as envisaged under the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan.

On 14 February 2023 the Board of Directors approved TIM’s 2023-2025 industrial plan (the “2023**2025** **Industrial Plan”) which continues the transformation process started in 2022. The new plan is**
consistent with the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan.

The 2023-2025 Industrial Plan envisages the following strategies for the four separate entities in the
new corporate configuration:

1 Aside from TIM Brasil which is an historical operating segment, these entities cannot currently be considered an “operating segment” in
accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating segments, insofar as on the one hand, the new entities are still in an analytical design phase and do not,
therefore, have analytical economic-financial information available and, on the other, the allocation of resources to each new entity and
assessment of the economic and financial performance on both the basis of the historic representation of the Business Units and, insofar as
available, the new entities being created is ongoing by TIM’s management.

-----

- _TIM Consumer: initiatives continue to implement the premium positioning in a volume to value_
strategy, with the aim of differentiating TIM from the competition. TIM Consumer intends to
continue the gradual repricing of the customer base, along with the introduction of inflation
adjustment mechanisms.

- _TIM Enterprise: targets growth above the reference market for 2023-2025, with a revenue_
CAGR of 6% over the plan period through increased standardisation and industrialisation of
offers and the consolidation of a bundled offer for public sector customers.

- _TIM NetCo: TIM’s strategic priorities are to further roll-out fixed ultra-broadband_
infrastructure, which will also provide backhauling to the 5G network, and to further accelerate
the migration of lines to FTTH technology. In the mobile segment, the priority is to maximise
5G coverage, which by 2025 targets reaching 90% of the population.

- _TIM Brasil: the company continues to focus on a value strategy and benefits from additional_
growth impetus from the integration of Oi’s assets, continuing on its path towards a ‘Next Gen
Telco’.

In developing its business, the TIM Group has adopted a sustainability strategy based on the objectives
of climate strategy, the circular economy, digital growth and gender equality and aims to become carbon
neutral in 2030 and achieve zero net emissions by 2040.

The Group also support projects of high social interest via TIM Foundation.

**Key Strengths**

TIM believes that it benefits from the following key strengths:

**_TIM is a leading player in the Italian telecommunications market, which benefits from improving_**
**_competitive landscape._**

TIM is a leading player in the Italian fixed, mobile and wholesale markets.

While the Italian telecommunications market (in both fixed and mobile segments) has experienced some
price pressure as a result of years of competitive tension due to the elevated number of operators, further
accelerated by the entrance of Iliad, the mobile and fixed markets are now showing clear signs of market
rationality. This translates into lower churn rates and offers opportunities to upsell customers with
“more for more” propositions. See also “Strong and resilient profitability profile with demonstrated
_resilience and upside potential underpinned by ongoing cost saving initiatives and improving market_
_trends.” Moreover, the telecommunications industry has proven to be resilient and essential for_
companies and consumers, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the industry continues to
facilitate valuable activities such as remote working, e-schooling and virtual entertainment.

TIM competes in the underpenetrated Italian broadband market, where it sees considerable room for
growth. Due to the lack of cable infrastructure and difficult morphology, only approximately 66% of
Italian households have a broadband connection versus an average European penetration of
approximately 78% as of 31 December 2021 (Source: “Digital Economy and Society Index 2022”, EU
Commission). This has resulted in FTTC connections, with average distance between cabinets and
premises among the shortest in Europe ensuring high connection speeds, remaining resilient and highly
cash generative in the Italian market, also in light of the limited alternatives available. As a result of
this, the FTTH market in Italy also remains underpenetrated, at 9% as compared to an average of 31%
across the European Union as at 30 September 2021 (Source: “FTTH/B Market Panorama in Europe”,
_2022, FTTH Council Europe)._

2


-----

In the consumer segment, TIM believes that the main drivers of data traffic growth include trends such
as: the growing use of streaming platforms, online shopping, online banking applications, video-ondemand, as well as gaming and video activities. The growing adoption of these new applications was
boosted by social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns and the ensuing
changes in work and life habits (e.g., remote working, home schooling, and greater adoption of virtual
social interactions).

In the enterprise segment (mainly focused on large corporates and public administration), relevant
drivers for data traffic growth include cloud, IoT, business continuity and security.

On the back of these long-term trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to continue growing, driven
primarily by broadband connectivity usage. As reported by AGCOM, in the last 3 years alone, data
traffic has, respectively, doubled and tripled on fixed and mobile as of 30 September 2022.

TIM also competes in the IT services, which has historically been underpenetrated compared to
equivalent markets in other European countries. The increasing penetration of IT services in Italy is
expected to accelerate as Italian companies increase their spending on IT services to improve their
competitive advantage and keep pace with the global trend towards digitalisation. The Italian IT services
markets are characterised by structural market dynamics which work against international competitors,
mainly due to cultural and local commercial complexities, such as language, local regulatory constraints
in many markets including banking, energy, and healthcare, the importance of local relationships and
proximity to customers, which is particularly applicable to the public sector. As a result, TIM believes
that such dynamics favour local players, thus allowing it to capitalise on its leading positioning in the
IT services market, given its deep knowledge of the domestic market and long-lasting relationships with
a wide cross-section of Italian customers and partners. Italian customers have also been shown to prefer
IT service suppliers with whom they share a common language, that have extensive operations in Italy
and that have an in-depth know-how of the applicable Italian legal and regulatory framework, which
TIM believes makes entering the Italian telecommunications markets more challenging for international
players. TIM considers that the growth of its TIM Enterprise underlying market is mainly driven by
strong ongoing digitalisation across the Italian public and private sector institutions, with increased IT
services spend on, and diversified growth of, new digital enabling technologies such as (i) IoT (which
is expected to grow by a CAGR of approximately 8% between 2021 and 2030), (ii) cloud services
(which is expected to grow by a CAGR of approximately 12% between 2021 and 2030), (iii)
connectivity (which is expected to remain substantially stable between 2021 and 2030), and (iv) security
(which is expected to grow by a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2021 and 2030).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Union put in place a set of measures applicable
to all member states in order to help them through the crisis and create a joint platform for economic
and social recovery. The national recovery and resilience plan (“NRRP”) presented by Italy provided
for substantial investment and a set of reforms representing approximately €250 billion in total, which
will be funded both at EU level and nationally. One of the plan’s main objectives is the digital
modernisation of Italy’s communication infrastructure, both in public administration and the country’s
production system, in order to provide fast connectivity nationwide for individuals, businesses, schools
and hospitals. The plan therefore comprises several measures to boost the creation of high-performance
networks, notably fibre and 5G as well as satellite technologies, and simplifies the regulatory framework
for their rollout. Under the NRRP, TIM has been assigned lots entailing the deployment of ultrabroadband infrastructure for a combined amount of €2.9 billion of investments until 2026. Out of the
€2.9 billion in public investments, TIM will receive €2.3 billion of cash contributions until 2027. This
will allow clear opportunities for TIM in the infrastructure development, digitisation and innovation
fields. In particular, TIM was assigned 7 lots under the “Italia 1Giga” initiatives (representing
approximately 1.2 million technical households), all available lots under the “5G Backhauling”
initiative (representing over 11,000 mobiles sites) and “5G Coverage” initiative (representing over
1,200 mobile sites), 2 lots under the “Connected Healthcare” initiative (representing approximately

3,100 healthcare facilities) and 4 lots under the “Connected Schools” initiative (representing
approximately 5,900 schools).

**_TIM holds a resilient incumbent position and leading market share in its fixed, mobile and enterprise_**
**_segments._**

TIM is the incumbent telecommunications operator in Italy with a highly resilient business model partly
due to its ability to offer full-service solutions (including broadband, pay-TV, landline voice and
mobile) using primarily its own fixed line and mobile infrastructure.

TIM benefits from a leading position across fixed and mobile markets in Italy, with a retail market share
of 28.5% in mobile (includes mobile voice and mobile broadband) as compared to 27.6%, 24.2% and
8.7% for the next three competitors and 41.9% in fixed (retail, includes voice and fixed broadband) as
compared to 16.2%, 14.3% and 14.1% for the next three competitors as of 30 September 2022. TIM’s
service offering is best in class with broadband speeds of up to 10 Gbps, fully flexible TV packages
including streaming services, and a wide range of data packages available in mobile, with speeds of up
to 2 Gbps on 5G.

TIM is the only infrastructure-based ICT player in Italy and benefits from a leading position in the
Italian IT services market for large enterprise and is uniquely positioned in the Public Administration
segment through TIM Enterprise. In 2022, TIM was one of the leading ICT providers for large
enterprises with 40% market share in Connectivity[2] and more than 10% in IT services[3] in Italy as at 31
December 2022. TIM is also a clear leader and has a unique position in the provision of services for its
public administration segment to approximately 25,000 clients, with a market share of approximately
50% in Connectivity and 15% in IT services in Italy as at 31 December 2021. The IT service market is
characterised by a relatively high market share captured by local players, mainly due to cultural and
local commercial complexities, such as language, local regulatory constraints in most industries
including banking, energy and healthcare, the importance of local relationships and proximity to
customers. TIM is one of the largest local players in this fragmented market where scale increasingly
matters, and TIM is able to capitalise on its position as a leading ICT provider to large customers and
the Public Administration segment thanks to its ability to offer converged end-to-end solutions. TIM
believes that due to a trend among its customers to reduce operational complexity by consolidating
around key partners for telecom and data services, cloud, IoT and security, natural convergence will
occur. Growth in IT services spend is also driven by the increasingly mission-critical nature of IT
services in business operations which TIM expects to result in IT services spend in Italy becoming more
recurring and resilient in the face of future market downturns and less correlated to macroeconomic
trends.

**_TIM has a set of valuable assets, from a top brand, to unique telecommunications and IT_**
**_infrastructure and know-how._**

TIM leads its competitors across a number of key attributes, including its valuable assets, infrastructure
and know-how comprising its extensive and reliable fixed and mobile network with one of the largest
spectrum portfolios in Italy, all supported by its top brand.

_Top Brand and Know-How_

2 **Connectivity services. The services needed to provide connections to the network. Connection is a unique, active service access point to a**
network. This includes voice services and data services and includes machine-to-machine network access as well as human access. A single
subscriber may operate several different connections and multiple connections may be associated with one subscriber or one device.
3 **IT services refer to the application of business and technical expertise to enable organisations in the creation, management and optimisation**
of, or access to, information and business processes. The IT services market can be segmented by the type of skills that are employed to deliver
the service (design, build, run). There are also different categories of service: business process services, application services and infrastructure
services.

4


-----

TIM benefits from strong brand recognition as the #1 telecom brand in Italy, with a brand awareness of
44% at top-of-mind and 77% spontaneous awareness among a consumer target population
representative of the broader Italian population according to MPS Research of December 2022 (source:
_“MPS Adv tracking”, December 2022). TIM’s leading market positions in Italy in mobile, fixed and_
wholesale further underscores the strength of its brands among Italian consumers. TIM is also welladvertised throughout Italy, acting as the title sponsor for Lega Series A and as sponsor for popular
music events in Italy, partnering with key opinion leaders across industries like Dolce & Gabbana,
Christian Vieri, Federica Pellegrini, Marcell Jacobs and rock band Maneskin in order to be relevant for
different target groups.

TIM’s top brand is underpinned by its best-in-class technology and know-how. As a fully convergent
player in both the business-to-business and business-to-consumer connectivity and service platform,
TIM is able to leverage its extensive and reliable infrastructure and asset base to offer a suite of fixed
and mobile line services, including 5G, 4G, TV and games, as well as IT services, including cloud,
security AI and IoT.

Moreover, TIM has a strong dedication to customer service and to its relationships with its loyal
customer base. In particular, TIM has invested considerably in recent years to improve its customer
service, which has resulted in better customer experiences and reduced churn. These improvements
reflect TIM’s focus on better services and the shift to a more digital customer service model. The quality
of its customer service both in its physical locations and through its online presence has improved
customer satisfaction. Specifically, TIM Enterprise benefits from a loyal customer base, with on average
a continued relationship of over 20 years with its top 10 clients. These longstanding relationships are
underpinned by its end-to-end solutions and experienced employee base who provide deep institutional
knowledge. TIM deploys a significant amount of resources to attract, maintain and train its employees,
project managers and digital and technology specialists. TIM generally has a low turn-over among its
employees and believes that its strong commitment to training, together with its reputation as of one of
the leading independent players, will allow it to continue to attract and retain skilled employees.

_Telecommunications and IT Infrastructure_

TIM benefits from unique telecommunications and IT infrastructure in Italy. In particular, as of 31
December 2022, TIM has provided access to approximately 16 million premises, of which more than
72% have FTTx access, with broadband speeds of over 100 Mbps for over 59% of premises. TIM’s
FTTx coverage was over 94% on active lines. Moreover, TIM has provided more than 5,700 schools
with broadband connection. In 2022, TIM has also progressed the upgrade of the access network from
copper to full-fibre by rolling out more than 1.2 million additional kilometres of cable. The shift from
copper to fibre is expected to reduce operational costs and result in slowing capital expenditure
requirements.

TIM Enterprise is the only infrastructure-based ICT player in Italy thanks to its assets base, which spans
from telecommunication assets to the largest proprietary data centre footprint in the country, with
sixteen data centres of which seven are “tier four”, as at 31 December 2022. The next largest ICT player
after TIM Enterprise has just one data centre. Over recent years, TIM has deployed significant
investments and has developed specific expertise in leading technologies and solutions. TIM expects
that TIM Enterprise will own a proprietary backbone in strategic areas, including more than forty-five
thousand dedicated customer fibre lines and a mobile core network to maintain full offer flexibility to
match client requirements and permit access to tenders requiring proprietary backbone.

_TIM’s technologically advanced and next-generation fixed and mobile assets and infrastructure are_
_reinforced by an ongoing future-proofing investment programme._

As of December 2022, TIM has constructed an extensive fibre network of approximately 22 million
kilometres nationwide, approximately 128 thousand fibre cabinets deployed nationwide. In addition,

5


-----

TIM’s ultra-broadband coverage reaches approximately 77% of the white areas, with approximately 4
million poles in such areas as of 31 December 2022. TIM also benefits from approximately 81% market
share in the overall fixed services market, retail and wholesale, and its FTTH coverage was
approximately 32% of technical units covered as at 31 December 2022.

Moreover, TIM’s 5G network is among the fastest in Europe in terms of download speed, according to
Opensignal. TIM’s 5G has reached 388 municipalities as at 31 December 2022 (active 5G sites), with
capex-efficient deployment benefitting from the sharing of active network infrastructure with
Vodafone. TIM has provided approximately 30.4 million mobile lines in Italy as at 31 December 2022.
TIM has also entered the world’s top 30 for having enabled an improvement in the switch from the 4G
to the 5G network in terms of download and upload speeds. Moreover, TIM’s 4G network covers over
99% of the national population, the highest in Italy. TIM has maintained this level of coverage for the
last four years. As of 31 December 2022, TIM holds the 3.6-3.8 GHz band, providing four times the
bandwidth of Wind Tre and Iliad in the 3.7 GHz band.

As such, TIM believes that it is well positioned to satisfy 5G market demand.

_Future-proofing Investment Programme_

While TIM has built a market leading, next-generation fixed and mobile infrastructure through
significant investments over time, it remains committed to further developing and future-proofing its
network with the support of the NRRP plan by investing in the latest network technologies. TIM intends
to continue its FTTH roll-out, with the aim to achieve approximately 65% FTTH coverage by 2028
from approximately 32% as of December 2022.

TIM also intends to continue to update and expand its mobile network, which it expects to significantly
expand 5G coverage to around 90% of the Italian population by 2025 in line with its 5G 700MHz
licensing obligations and increase its high-speed mobile data capabilities to over 50% of the population
with 3.7 GHz. TIM’s 5G expansion is underpinned by its valuable spectrum rights acquired in 2018. In
the 2018 multiband spectrum auction, TIM has obtained significant spectrum rights on all available
frequencies in the 700 MHz and 3.7 and 26 GHz bands (specifically, 2x10 MHz in 700MHz, 1x80MHz
in 3.7GHz and 1x200MHz in 26GHz), further consolidating its leadership in the sector. These 5G
spectrum rights expire in 2037. Moreover, in the future, TIM will gradually be able to use its 4G
frequencies (800MHz, 1800MHz, etc.) for 5G.

TIM believes that its investment plans uniquely position it to meet customer demand for high speed
services, as well as providing the critical high capacity fibre backhaul services required by mobile
operators to meet the growing demand for mobile data services and deliver its primary goal of having
the best network for its customers. TIM believes that growth in data traffic will increase utilisation of
its fibre network and, given the planned quality and reach of its network, TIM expects this will enable
it to further differentiate its network in the medium term. The ongoing investment programme benefits
from government support under the NRRP for the Italia 1Giga, 5G backhauling, 5G coverage,
connected healthcare and connected schools initiatives.

**_TIM Brasil benefits from next-generation telecommunication infrastructure, driving strong growth,_**
**_profitability and cash flow generation._**

TIM entered the Brazilian market more than 20 years ago. Through TIM Brasil, TIM offers mobile
voice and data services, broadband internet access, value-added services, and other telecommunications
services and products in Brazilian market.

The Brazilian telecommunications market offers attractive fundamentals as one of the largest consumer
markets with approximately 252 million mobile users and, according to Anatel, approximately 27
million fixed lines, representing the fifth largest globally as at 31 December 2022. Moreover, the

6


-----

Brazilian telecommunication market is expected to enjoy a cycle of ARPU growth after years of
competitive tension due to the consolidation of operators from four to three following the Oi transaction.
TIM Brasil believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from this growth, underpinned by its acquisition
of Oi mobile assets, which completed in 2022. TIM believes that the Brazilian market offers strong
growth and expects TIM Brasil to be able to leverage the additional infrastructure and spectrum from
Oi, together with the opportunity to exchange 4G into 5G investments and accelerate the migration from
FTTC to FTTH to drive network quality in order to outgrow the market.

TIM Brasil benefits from next-generation telecommunication infrastructure distributed throughout
Brazil. Its mobile network covers areas in which approximately 99% of the Brazilian urban population
lives and works (4G urban population coverage). According to ANATEL, as of 31 December 2022,
TIM Brasil had approximately a 25% market share of the Brazilian mobile telecommunications market
and approximately a 3% market share of the Brazilian fixed-line market. TIM Brasil is one of the most
profitable companies in the Latin American telecommunications market achieving leadership among
its peers in margin indicators and free cash flow yield with EBITDA margin of 47% and operating cash
flow margin of 26% for the year ended 31 December 2022 (average of peers, respectively, 41% and
19%).

**_Strong and resilient profitability profile with demonstrated resilience and upside potential_**
**_underpinned by ongoing cost saving initiatives and improving market trends._**

TIM is a leading, historically profitable company. On the key profitability metric of Organic EBITDA
margin, TIM is among the top performers in the Italian market and outpaces most of its comparable
European competitors with an Organic EBITDA margin around 38% compared to approximately a 33%
average for selected European peers (in 2022).

TIM generated Organic EBITDA-AL of approximately €5bn in the year ended 31 December 2022. See
“—Summary Financial Information and Other Data”. TIM believes that its resilient profitability profile
is a direct result of its focus on cost optimisation and organisational efficiency, which it expects to be
further underpinned by its transformation plan as well as a prudent capital expenditure policy.
Specifically, TIM’s transformation plan includes long-term targets regarding savings on labour and
external operational capital expenditure, expected to be achieved by accelerating digitalisation,
simplifying the cost structure and labour and cost optimisation.

In addition to ongoing cost-saving initiatives, the mobile and fixed markets are now showing clear signs
of market rationality on price. TIM has selectively repriced part of its customer base in 2022, and is
continuing the roll-out in 2023. At the same time, the market has introduced inflation indexed tariffs,
further aiding price rationality. Such price rationality translates into lower churn rates and offers
opportunities to upsell customers with “more for more” propositions.

**_Highly accomplished management team, committed to deleveraging with proven track record of_**
**_delivery._**

TIM benefits from a highly accomplished and experienced management team, led by its CEO, Pietro
Labriola, who was appointed in January 2022 and brings over 20 years of experience at the Group
including as the former CEO of TIM Brasil where he transformed TIM Brasil from a newcomer to a
market leader. TIM’s senior managers also include Adrian Calaza as CFO, Claudio Giovanni Ezio
Ongaro as Chief Strategy & Business Development Officer, Elio Schiavo as Chief Enterprise and
Innovative Solutions Officer, Andrea Rossini as Chief Consumer, Small & Medium Market Officer and
Elisabetta Romano as Chief Network Operations & Wholesale Office, who together have strong sector
knowledge of the broader telecommunications environment and international experience.

TIM’s management team is seasoned in running, acquiring and staffing telecommunications businesses
and in navigating consumer markets both in Italy and abroad, and they leverage the expertise they

7


-----

acquired over decades of combined experience at top-tier telecommunications and companies such as
Telecom Argentina, Wind Telecomunicazioni, Wind Tre, Apple and Vodafone. More importantly, the
management team has a strong track record of delivering growth from both organic initiatives and
strategic acquisitions and has won and maintained strong stakeholder support while maintaining a
strong debt capital structure. This industry-leading management team is supported by a deep bench of
divisional managers.

The new management brings a strong commitment to de-lever the group, both organically and through
the strategic options created by the delayering strategy. Management has enacted an ambitious costcutting transformation plan which targets €1.5 billion of total savings by 2024 (excluding TIM Brasil
business unit). As of 31 December 2022, management had achieved more than €0.3 billion of savings
(112% of the target for the year).

Despite external headwinds, TIM achieved a number of important milestones, among which: renewed
the management team, completed the integration of Oi in Brazil, won the tenders for the National
Strategic Hub and the NRRP, signed the commercial agreement with Open Fiber in “white areas”,
launched a new communication campaign, updated the EBITDA 2022 guidance, sold the indirect stake
in Inwit, revised the agreement with DAZN, signed a new labour agreement, launched the 10 Gbps
commercial service, participated to the public consultation on 2023 wholesale rates, set up the process
to make TIM Enterprise a legal entity and met 2022 NRRP milestones and FiberCop roll out targets.
The chart below represents the abovementioned milestones achieved by TIM.

**TIM’s Strategy**

TIM operates in a market that is both highly regulated and competitive. The Group’s four key businesses
–Enterprise Customers, Consumer Customers, Network and Wholesale and TIM Brasil – operate in
distinct markets and face different competitive dynamics, each with their specific industrial focus and
economics. The Group is experiencing market and business trends specific to each of the four
businesses.

Reorganising the Group around these four business segments enables each business to pursue a focused
strategy. Such organisational change allows management to focus on clear and business specific KPIs
to measure success in order to facilitate efficient management and improved capital allocation. The
purpose of this delayering strategy is industrial, which translates into unlocking growth and achieving
better operational results while also focusing on efficiencies and funding the investments that will

8


-----

shorten the path to increased cash generation. The separation of NetCo from the other businesses is also
key to an improved regulatory environment for TIM Enterprise and TIM Consumer in the Italian
market, enabling these businesses to compete on a level playing field with other retail operators in the
market.

The delayering plan also opens up a number of strategic options in order to (i) achieve substantial
deleveraging towards a more sustainable long-term capital structure and/or (ii) potentially capture inmarket consolidations to accelerate growth and strategy implementation. At the same time, TIM has
started to implement an ambitious cost-cutting transformation plan which targets €1.5 billion of total
savings by 2024 (excluding TIM Brasil business unit). In 2022, TIM achieved 112% of the 2022 cost
savings target with over €0.3 billion of OpEx savings of which around €100 million represented labour
costs and more than EUR 200 million external operating expenses.

**_NetCo_**

NetCo is the Group’s network company and comprises the national and international wholesale
businesses and all fixed network assets, including the entire access network – the infrastructure on
which Italy’s digitalisation can progress. NetCo also includes FiberCop (which is jointly owned with
KKR Global Infrastructure and Fastweb), as well as Sparkle, which is ranked fifth among international
carriers for its IP network and is expected to further develop through a selective expansion into new
geographies.

NetCo aims at leveraging growth opportunities from Italy’s underpenetrated broadband and ultrabroadband connections at secondary network level since as of 31 December 2021 (Source: EU Digital
_Economy and Society Index 2022) only approximately 66% of Italian households had a fixed broadband_
connection versus a European average penetration of approximately 78% at that the same time. The
ongoing investment programme to deploy ultra-broadband infrastructure benefits from government
support under the NRRP for the “Italia 1Giga”, “5G backhauling”, “5G Coverage”, “Connected
Healthcare” and “Connected School” initiatives, for which TIM has been assigned lots entailing the
deployment of ultra-broadband infrastructure for a combined amount of €2.9 billion of investments
until 2026. Out of the €2.9 billion, TIM will receive €2.3 billion of cash contributions until 2027.

Following an FTTH investment cycle aiming at a total fibre footprint of 16 million technical units or
approximately 65% national coverage by 2028, NetCo is expected to become a typical, focused
infrastructure company with stable cash flows set to guarantee third-party access to all communication
service providers. The shift from copper to fibre should reduce the operational cost structure and result
long term in reduced capital expenditure requirements. At the same time increased take-up of the newly
deployed FTTH network is expected to further contribute to a growth in profitability. Moreover, NetCo
is also expected to benefit from the proposed increases to the Italian wholesale tariffs, in order to bring
wholesale tariffs broadly in line with other large European markets. In this context, the Group is open
to considering strategic partnerships and combinations to create a single network infrastructure for the
country.

**_ServiceCo_**

The ServiceCo perimeter comprises the Group’s service businesses in Italy (TIM Enterprise, at a
business-to-business level, and TIM Consumer, at a business-to-consumer / retail level) and TIM Brasil.
The clear separation from NetCo facilitates strategic flexibility and is key to an improved regulatory
environment for the retail operations in the Italian market, enabling these businesses to compete on a
level playing field with other retail operators in the market and with reduced limitations under applicable
competition laws. Moreover, ServiceCo may also benefit from potential upsides, such as in-market
consolidation if these were to materialise.

_TIM Enterprise_

9


-----

TIM Enterprise is the only infrastructure-based ICT player in Italy, offering integrated end-to-end
solutions for telecom and data services, cloud (including professional and managed services), IoT and
security. TIM Enterprise is the market leader in the large enterprise and public administration segments
and benefits from a loyal customer base of approximately 35,000 clients split between large corporates
(approximately 10,000 clients) and public administration (approximately 25,000 clients). The business
relies on long and stable relationships with an average length of over 20 years with its top 10 clients
and average contractual duration of three years (currently increasing as business shifts to an increased
share of IT services). The company operates in a growing and underpenetrated market expected to grow
at a CAGR of approximately 4% from 2021 through 2030, with growth opportunities particularly in
cloud, IoT and security. Specifically, the company expects that the share of revenue mix derived from
connectivity will shift from 41% of revenue for 2021, to approximately 28% in 2030, with the largest
contributor to revenue expected to be cloud services, at approximately 44% in 2030.

TIM Enterprise has clear and distinctive competitive advantages to gain from expected market
momentum, including (i) unmatched offering in the Italian market, (ii) an owned infrastructure mobile
network, (iii) 16 directly owned data centres (including seven with a Tier-4 rating) and (iv) opportunities
to develop dedicated customer infrastructure.

The unique combination of (i) deep, established customer relationships, (ii) an unparalleled asset base
and network of data centres, (iii) a proprietary backbone in strategic areas, and (iv) strategic partnerships
with leading technology providers such as Google, Oracle, Microsoft and VMWare makes TIM
Enterprise the natural reference point for many large enterprises and public bodies that seek to
streamline their telecommunication and IT infrastructure, ideally with a single company providing
seamless end-to-end services. With core data services increasingly integrated with cloud, IoT and
security solutions, this convergence will only continue. TIM Enterprise is uniquely positioned to
capitalise on this opportunity.

As part of establishing TIM Enterprise as its own separate business unit, management is developing an
integrated go-to-market approach between the historically separately managed brands TIM Enterprise,
Noovle, Telsy and Olivetti. A scaled-up combined product factory will end historic fragmentation
between the brands, thereby creating potential for synergies and capacity for new proprietary
capabilities due to fully integrated end-to-end product capabilities. The company’s primary focus is on
the continuing acquisition of scale, focusing on proprietary products and public administration cloud
strategy and personnel reskilling in light of an expanding offering.

TIM Enterprise believes that these measures will result in higher revenues, significantly increased cash
conversion and optimised capex and operational costs.

_TIM Consumer_

The TIM Consumer business operates in a highly competitive environment. In response, management
is implementing a recovery and transformation strategy. The goal is to transform TIM Consumer into
an agile, efficient, and commercially flexible premium business with a shift in strategy from volume to
value. Delayering will enable management to take end-to-end responsibility for the entire business, with
full accountability for the implementation of the strategy. TIM also expects that delayering will enable
higher commercial flexibility by lifting price-replicability rules and allowing a level playing field with
competitors.

As part of the transformation, the business has focused on activities that delivered value in the short
term both in terms of costs and top line such as a successful implementation of a brand repositioning
and pricing redesign, improved organisational structure and capital expenditure, as well as IT demand
optimisation.

10


-----

As near-term goal, the business aims at stabilising the customer base through reduced churn, with
gradual ARPU increases through a “more for more” proposition, a turn-around of its current content
strategy and the TIM Vision platform, the optimisation and digitalisation of the current channel mix
and higher FTTH / 5G uptake which should provide opportunities for improved pricing. Cost
optimisation spans several initiatives with the ambition to reduce caring costs by 30%, bad debt by 55%
and advertising expenses by 20% compared to a 2021 baseline. This also includes right-sizing the
organisation with a 20% FTE reduction from approximately 14,000 in 2021. Overall, management aims
at a reduction of the addressable 2021 operational expenditures by 34%.

Management targets include reducing the capital intensity of the business through active sharing
agreements on mobile network infrastructure and by redesigning the business’s IT infrastructure,
resulting in a reduction of TIM Consumer’s capital expenditure (net of licence).

These measures will form the basis for sustainable growth based on a high-quality positioning and an
attractive digital services offering.

_TIM Brasil_

TIM Brasil aims at becoming the next generation telco in order to deliver superior and sustainable value
to its shareholders. TIM Brasil, a 67%-owned listed subsidiary of the Group, is already among the most
profitable and cash-generative telco companies in Latin America and leads its peers with an operating
cash flow margin of 26% for the year ended 31 December 2022 (average of peers 19%). It operates in
a large, increasingly attractive and growing market, which has benefited from recent consolidation from
five to three mobile operators (including TIM Brasil’s integration of part of Oi), a healthy regulatory
environment and continuous growth in addressable customer base.

TIM Brasil’s strategy aims at further strengthening cash flow generation in its core connectivity
business, through the deployment of 5G coverage and the migration of FTTC to FTTH technology.
Benefits to efficiency and scale are expected to originate from the ongoing integration of Oi operations,
which is currently subject to one-off operation expenditure and capital expenditure as part of the
integration. Further growth opportunities targeted by TIM Brasil go beyond the core business with the
ambition to become a full vertical orchestrator of B2B and IoT services, in partnership with industry
leaders.

**_Delayering plan execution and capital structure_**

One of the overall objectives of the delayering plan is a substantial reduction in net leverage of TIM, in
order to achieve a long-term sustainable capital structure mainly through the combination of several
strategic options which may include (i) debt deconsolidation and (ii) cash proceeds from M&A
transactions, such as a potential disposal of NetCo, a sale of a minority stake in TIM Enterprise and, if
needed, opportunistically assessing options on other assets, if terms are attractive.

On 9 November 2022, TIM’s Board of Directors approved the separation of TIM Enterprise into a new
legal entity.

On 1 February 2023, TIM received a non-binding offer from KKR for the purchase of a stake in a
company to be set up that matches the fixed-line network management and infrastructure perimeter,
including FiberCop’s assets and activities, as well as the stake in Sparkle (known as “Netco”). The offer
refers to a stake to be defined, on the understanding that the purchase would result in the loss of vertical
integration in relation to TIM.

On 24 February 2023, TIM's Board of Directors examined the non-binding offer submitted by KKR. In
consideration of the information received, the Board of Directors highly appreciated the interest
expressed in the aforementioned non-binding offer, while considering that it did not wholly reflect the

11


-----

value of the asset and TIM's expectations, also in terms of the sustainability of the company resulting
from the transaction contemplated thereby. Consequently, in order to facilitate the alignment of the
terms of the proposed transaction with the strategic framework relevant to TIM, the Board of Directors
resolved to make available to KKR - on a non-exclusive basis - certain specific information and to
request the further indications necessary to fully understand the assumptions and economics of the
proposal.

On 5 March 2023, TIM received a non-binding offer from a consortium formed by Cassa Depositi e
Prestiti Equity S.p.A. (CDPE) and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (Europe) Limited (the
“Consortium”), acting on behalf of a group of investment funds managed or advised by the Macquarie
group, for the purchase of 100% of a company to be set up, that matches the management and
infrastructure perimeter of the fixed network, including the assets and activities FiberCop, as well as
the stake in Sparkle. CDPE’s parent company Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. holds 9.81% of TIM’s
ordinary share capital (see “The Issuer”).

On 15 March 2023, in order to allow the Consortium and KKR to submit their improved offers within
defined competitive bidding process, the Board of Directors mandated the Chief Executive Officer,
Pietro Labriola, to initiate a structured process, by sending both bidders, through their advisors, a
process letter outlining (i) the terms under which they will be given access to additional specific
information, the same for both bidders and (ii) the ways through which each of them may submit a nonbinding improved offer by the deadline of 18 April 2023.

As is normal for transactions of this kind, the non-binding offers are indicative and subject to in-depth
examinations, analyses and assessments by TIM, including through discussions with the offerors, also
aimed to improve the relevant bid for the fixed network assets.

Should a disposal of NetCo not be possible on attractive terms, the Group retains flexibility to
deconsolidate NetCo through alternative transaction structures. Such a scenario would include a
deconsolidation of debt such that an independent NetCo would be expected to carry a significant portion
of the Group’s current debt. Additional deleveraging options include a disposal of a minority stake in
TIM Enterprise and the opportunistic disposal of other assets.

With debt maturities through 2024 already covered by available liquidity (after-lease view), the Group
maintains a high degree of flexibility to explore additional cash-in options to maximise value for the
Group and its stakeholders and believes that it is well equipped to navigate the challenging and volatile
market conditions.

**the Holders on the Occurrence**
**of a Change of Control and a**
**Network Event ...........................**


(b) where a Person into which the Issuer is merged or to
whom it has conveyed, transferred or leased all or
substantially all of its assets is required to pay
additional amounts, unless the sole purpose of such a
merger would be to permit the Issuer to redeem the
Notes,

as further described in Condition 6.2 (Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons)._

The Issuer may, having given (a) not less than 15 nor more than
30 days’ notice to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 12 (Notices), and (b) notice to the Trustee and the
Principal Paying Agent not less than 15 days before the giving
of the notice referred to in (a) above (which notices shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption),
redeem all (but not some only) of the Notes at the Optional
Redemption Amount together, if appropriate, with interest
accrued to (but excluding) the Optional Redemption Date. See
Condition 6.3 (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Make_Whole Call))._

The Issuer may, having given (a) not less than 30 nor more than
60 days’ notice to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 12 (Notices), and (b) notice to the Trustee and the
Principal Paying Agent not less than 15 days before the giving

whole but not in part) on the date which is seven days after the
expiration of the Put Period (as defined in Condition 6.5
(Redemption at the Option of the Holders on the Occurrence of
_a Change of Control and Network Event)) at_ 101% of their

acquires such Control or Joint Control).

17


-----

**Redemption at the Option of**
**the Issuer (Equity Offering) ......**


A “Network Event” will be deemed to occur upon a Disposition
of (i) all or a substantial portion (constituting more than onehalf in quantitative terms) of the properties or assets comprised
in the Network to a Person or Persons which are not a
Subsidiary or, as applicable, Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii)
shares of a Person or Persons to which the Network, or a
substantial portion thereof, was previously transferred if such
Disposition of shares results in the Issuer ceasing to have
Control over any such Person or Persons; _provided that,_
immediately after giving pro forma effect to such Disposition
(including any substantially concurrent application of the
proceeds thereof) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the
Issuer exceeds 3.00 to 1.00.

See Condition 6.5 (Redemption at the Option of the Holders on
_the Occurrence of a Change of Control and Network Event)._

At any time, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions, upon
not less than 15 nor more than 30 days’ notice, redeem up to 40
per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
originally issued at a redemption price equal to 106.875 per
cent. of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to
the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of the
Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the
relevant Interest Payment Date), with the net cash proceeds of
an Equity Offering, subject as set out in Condition 6.6
(Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Equity Offering).

“Equity Offering” means a sale of Capital Stock (other than to
the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries) that is a sale of Capital
Stock of the Issuer other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Capital Stock (including rights, warrants and options) which is
issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or
granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees
or directors (including directors holding or formerly holding
executive office or the personal service company of any such
person), in each case, of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for
the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any
share or option scheme.

See Condition 6.6 (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer
_(Equity Offering))._


**Withholding Tax .......................** All payments of principal, premium and interest in respect of
the Notes and the Coupons by or on behalf of the Issuer will be
made without withholding or deduction for or on account of any
present or future Taxes, subject as provided in Condition 7
(Taxation). In the event that any such withholding or deduction
is made, the Issuer will, save as provided in Condition 7
(Taxation), will pay such additional amounts as shall be
necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders

18


-----

of the Notes or Coupons after such withholding or deduction
shall equal the respective amounts of principal, premium and
interest which would otherwise have been receivable in respect
of the Notes or Coupons, as the case may be, in the absence of
such withholding or deduction.

**Substitution.................................** The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders, agree
with the Issuer to the substitution in place of the Issuer (or of
any previous substitute) as the principal debtor under the Notes
of another company, being any entity that may succeed to, or to
which the Issuer (or any previous substitute) may transfer, all
or substantially all of the assets and business of the Issuer (or
any previous substitute) by operation of law, contract or
otherwise, subject to (a) the Trustee being satisfied that the
interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by
the substitution and (b) certain other conditions set out in the
Trust Deed being complied with.

The terms of the Notes contain a provision restricting the ability
of the Issuer to create security interests in respect of certain
indebtedness and to guarantee certain secured indebtedness of
its Subsidiaries, as further described in Condition 3.1
(Covenants—Restrictions on Security Interests).


**Cross Default ..............................** See Condition 9 (Events of Default).

**Status of the Notes ......................** The Notes and the Coupons relating to them are unconditional,
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and

Adjusted net financial debt represents the Net Financial Debt Carrying Amount, which neutralizes the effects caused by the
volatility of financial markets. Given that some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the
exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual
monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and nonmonetary effects (including the
effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

Adjusted net financial debt-AL represents adjusted net financial debt, excluding the net liabilities related to the accounting
treatment of lease contracts according to IFRS 16.

# Organic EBITDA-AL for the year ended 31 December 2021 is presented on a comparable base with 31 December 2022
due to the effect of foreign currency financial statements transaction as well as the changes in the scope of consolidation.
Please see subsequent point c) and d).

(a) Non-recurring expenses/(income) relate to events and transactions that, in the Issuer’s opinion, by their
nature do not occur on an ongoing basis in the normal course of operations and which have impact results
in a significant amount. Non-recurring charges include, among others, provisions for regulatory disputes and
potential liabilities related to them, liabilities with customers and/or suppliers, and provisions for onerous
contracts, charges associated with corporate reorganization/restructuring and prior-year adjustments.

Specifically, non-recurring events for the year 2021 include:

          - €735 million in other operating expenses, mainly referring to provisions made for disputes,
transactions, regulatory sanctions and related potential liabilities as well as expenses connected
with the COVID-19 emergency for provisions made as a consequence of the worsening of the
expected credit losses of corporate customers, connected with the expected evolution of the
pandemic.

`o` Other operating expenses - sundry expenses and provisions include €548 million for the
posting of a contractual risk provision for onerous contracts (IAS 37) relating to ongoing
relations with some counterparties for the offer of multimedia content. In particular, they
include the accrual of the net present value of the negative margin connected with some
partnerships, including the one in place between TIM and DAZN for the offer in Italy on
the TIMVISION platform of DAZN content, including all matches of the Serie A football
championship for the seasons 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24.

          - €367 million in employee benefit expenses mainly connected with business
reorganization/restructuring processes following the application of art. 4 of Law no. 92 of 28
June 2012, as defined in the trade union agreements signed between the some of the Group
companies, including the Parent Company TIM S.p.A. and the trade unions.

          - €49 million for expenses related to agreements and the development of non-recurring projects,
as well as costs for purchases relating to supplies that became necessary for the management of
the health emergency.

          - €8 million in net income for adjustments to revenues and the recovery of operating expenses.

Specifically, non-recurring events for the year 2022 include:

          - €77 million in other operating expenses, mainly due to provisions for disputes, transactions,
regulatory sanctions and related potential liabilities. It includes, in particular, a provision made
by TIM S.p.A. of 41 million euros for onerous contracts relating to a multi-year agreement
concluded in 2021 which committed the Company to minimum purchases and the total estimated
cost of which for the residual duration of the agreement became apparent in 2022.

          - €572 million in employee benefit expenses mainly connected with business
reorganization/restructuring processes following the application of art. 4 of Law no. 92 of June
28, 2012, as defined in the trade union agreements signed between the some of the Group
companies, including the Parent Company TIM S.p.A. and the trade unions.

          - €56 million mainly for non-recurring expenses associated with agreements and the development
of corporate transformation and expansion projects in Italy and Brazil

          - €23 million in other income for the recovery of operating expenses.

(b) Adjusted for lease payments during the period. The year ended 31 December 2021 is presented on a
comparable base with 31 December 2022 due to the effect of foreign currency financial statements
transaction as well as the changes in the scope of consolidation.

27


-----

(c) Foreign currency translation effects result from the translation of the results of a subsidiary that prepares its
accounts in a currency other than the euro, into the Issuer’s reporting currency, which is the euro. The Issuer
adjusts Organic EBITDA for these translation effects in order to facilitate period-to-subsequent period
comparability. The effect in the year ended 31 December 2021 was mainly due to the exchange rate
fluctuation mainly related to the Brazil Business Unit.

(d) Changes in scope of consolidation reflect adjustments to prior-period perimeters to facilitate period-tosubsequent period comparability to the scope of consolidation at reporting date.

(e) Organic EBITDA for any of the periods presented equals Organic EBITDA-AL, with the above adjustment
for lease payments added back in.

(7) Organic Revenues represents Revenues excluding, where applicable, effects of the change in the scope of consolidation, exchange
differences and non-recurring events and transactions.

(8) Organic EBITDA-AL Margin represents the ratio of Organic EBITDA-AL to Organic Revenues, in each case for the year ended
31 December 2022, expressed as a percentage.

(9) _Pro forma cash and cash equivalents represents cash and cash equivalents after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the_
Original Notes and the Further Notes, the repayment on 16 January 2023 of the Issuer’s €1,000,000,000 3.250% Senior Unsecured
Notes due 16 January 2023 and the application of proceeds therefrom as if these transactions had occurred on 31 December 2022,
as set out in “Capitalisation”.

(10) _Pro forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt-AL represents Adjusted Net Financial Debt-AL after giving pro forma effect to the issuance_
of the Original Notes and the Further Notes, the repayment on 16 January 2023 of the Issuer’s €1,000,000,000 3.250% Senior
Unsecured Notes due 16 January 2023 and the application of proceeds therefrom as if these transactions had occurred on 31
December 2022, as set out in “Capitalisation”.

(11) _Pro forma Net finance income/(expenses) represents Net finance income/(expenses), after giving pro forma effect to the issuance_
of the Original Notes and the Further Notes, the repayment on 16 January 2023 of the Issuer’s €1,000,000,000 3.250% Senior
Unsecured Notes due 16 January 2023 and the application of proceeds therefrom as if these transactions had occurred on 1 January
2022. Pro forma Net finance income/(expenses) is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be what the
Issuer’s interest expense would have actually been had these transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to
project the Issuer’s interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_In purchasing the Further Notes, investors assume the risk that the Issuer may become insolvent or_
_otherwise be unable to make all payments due in respect of the Notes. There is a wide range of factors_
_which individually or together could result in the Issuer becoming unable to make all payments due in_
_respect of the Notes. It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which factors are most_
_likely to occur, as the Issuer may not be aware of all relevant factors and certain factors which it_
_currently deems not to be material may become material as a result of the occurrence of events outside_
_the Issuer’s control. The Issuer has identified in this Information Memorandum a number of factors_
_which could materially adversely affect its business and ability to make payments due under the Notes._
_Most of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position_
_to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. In addition, factors which are_
_material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described_
_below._

_Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Information_
_Memorandum or incorporated by reference therein and reach their own views prior to making any_
_investment decision._

_Words and expressions defined elsewhere in this Information Memorandum have the same meaning in_
_this section. Prospective Noteholders should read the entire Information Memorandum and documents_
_incorporated by reference therein._

**1.** **RISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND INDUSTRIES OF THE**
**ISSUER.**

**_TIM’s business will be adversely affected if TIM is unable to successfully implement its strategic_**
**_objectives. Factors beyond its control may prevent it from successfully implementing its strategy._**

On 2 March 2022, TIM’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) approved the 2022 – 2024
Industrial Plan and on 14 February 2023 the Board of Directors approved the 2023 – 2025 Industrial
Plan which continues the transformation process started in 2022.

In recent years the telecommunications market has shown a high level of competition, which has
resulted in a significant reduction in customer spending, while at the same time requiring an increasing
level of investment needed to support network development. In the face of the contraction of the
traditional telecommunication core business related to connectivity of voice and data, TIM has
progressively evolved its positioning across its markets.

Currently, TIM is effectively operating in adjacent markets, with different levels of competition and
different investment cycles, using specific commercial approaches and operating models.

TIM has defined a specific strategy for the different areas of competition in the Italian market.

- Development of the fixed network with a strong acceleration of the Fiber to The Home Network
(hereafter “FTTH”) coverage and 5G solutions (supported also by the Italian National
Recovery and Resilience Plan (hereafter “NRRP”[4]) through the awarded tenders of the “Italia
_1 Giga” and “5G backhauling” auctions), operating in a fixed line market expected to reach_
approximately 24 million users by 2030, possibly with a 100% high speed connection – the so
called ultra-broadband (“UBB”) – penetration on active fixed lines.

4 Document, recently approved by the European Commission, describing which projects Italy intends to implement by applying designated
EU funds. The plan also outlines how these resources will be managed and also presents a timetable for related reforms aimed partly at
implementing the plan and partly at modernizing the country.


-----

- In the Enterprise market characterized by stable growth and a change in the revenue mix with
an increase in the weight of cloud, IoT and security services, the commercial strategy is focused
on the transition to advanced connectivity solutions and the development of proprietary
Information and Communications Technology (hereafter “ICT”) services, products and
solutions, strengthening the integrated approach to the ICT offer to large enterprises and public
administrations.

- In the Consumer and Small & Medium Business (hereafter “SMB”) segments, TIM is engaged
in strengthening its premium positioning with a greater focus on the retention of its customer
base and the penetration of ICT solutions among target customers.

To mitigate regulatory constraints, reduce the level of debt, and increase the focus on the markets it
focuses on, TIM has decided to move from a vertically integrated operator structure and assume a new
horizontal structure, divided into separate entities:

- NetCo: the network company in Italy, which will also include national and international
wholesale assets and activities.

- ServiceCo: the services company, which will include three business units: TIM Enterprise,
dedicated to the segment of large Italian companies and the Italian public administration (and
possibly further separate this business unit into a standalone entity); TIM Consumer, to serve
Italian households, individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises; and TIM Brasil, which
serves the Brazilian market.

TIM’s ability to implement and achieve its strategic objectives and priorities may be influenced by
certain factors, including factors outside of its control. Such factors include:

- TIM’s ability to successfully compete on both price and innovation capabilities with respect to
new products and services;

- a deterioration of the economic environment (also taking into consideration the impact of
current inflationary environment and the energy crisis impact) in the principal markets in which
TIM operates, including, in particular, its core Italian market;

- the impact of regulatory decisions and changes in the regulatory environment in Italy, Brazil
and other countries in which TIM operates, including the ability of the Italian government to
exercise its power with respect to entering into strategic transactions;

- TIM’s ability to develop and introduce new technologies that are attractive in its principal
markets, to manage innovation, to supply value added services and to increase the use of its
fixed and mobile networks;

- TIM’s ability to successfully implement its internet and broadband/UBB strategy (especially
the FTTH);

- TIM’s ability to successfully achieve its financial targets (including debt reduction);

- the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates and the performance of the
equity markets in general;

- the outcome of litigation, disputes and investigations in which TIM is involved or may become
involved;


-----

- TIM’s ability to build up its business in adjacent markets and in international markets
(particularly in Brazil), due to its specialist and technical resources;

- TIM’s ability to achieve the expected return on the investments and capital expenditures it has
made and continues to make in Italy, Brazil and other countries in which it operates;

- the amount and timing of any future impairment charges for TIM’s authorisations, goodwill or
other assets;

- TIM’s ability to manage any business or operating model transformation plans;

- any difficulties which TIM may encounter in its supply and procurement processes, including
as a result of the insolvency or financial weaknesses of its suppliers; and

- the costs TIM incurs due to unexpected events, in particular where its insurance is not sufficient
to cover such costs.

As a result of these uncertainties there can be no assurance that the business and strategic objectives
identified by TIM’s management can effectively be attained in the manner and within the time-frames
described. Furthermore, if TIM is unable to attain its strategic priorities, or if a further deterioration of
macroeconomic and geopolitical scenario would exacerbate financial market conditions in the form of
higher rates, wider credit spreads and insufficient ability of the Issuer to reflect rising inflation to its
customer, its goodwill may be further impaired, which could result in further significant write-offs.

**_Market competition_**

Telecommunications operators have generally faced challenging market conditions in recent years,
principally as a result of the decline in voice traffic and significant pricing pressures resulting from
increased competition among operators.

Strong competition exists in all principal areas of the Italian telecommunications business in which TIM
operates; from the Other Licensed Operators (“OLO”) in the Retail segment and from the Alternative
Network operators (“AltNet”) and in the Wholesale National Market (as defined below).

Competition may become even more acute in the coming years, with additional international operators
accessing the Italian market.

The Italian telecommunications market continues to have an intense level of competition which
generates for the TIM Group risks of a reduction in market share and pressure on prices. In the fixed
market, for example, the recent launch of Iliad has added an additional risk pressure to an already
complex situation.

In the current macroeconomic environment (see the paragraph Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Macro_Economic Conditions) TIM is introducing price mechanisms for adjusting the offer to the changed_
inflationary context in order to reduce the pressure on cash costs. Given the high level of competition
in the market there is the concrete risk that some competitors will not follow pursuing a price-based
competition resulting in reduction of the TIM’s market share and further pressure on price on the Retail
market segment


-----

TIM’s core business is expanding to include innovative and convergent services and offers for fixed
and mobile telecommunication, as well as television content. This expansion creates new opportunities
and risks for TIM, as it faces increased competition from Information Technology (“IT”), Over-TheTop (“OTT”), media and devices/consumer electronic players. The telecommunications market is also
experiencing consolidation and globalization, which may further intensify competition.

TIM has entered into long-term contracts for television contents distribution that commit it to paying a
guaranteed minimum amount to the counterparties. The evaluation of these contracts and the estimate
of the costs associated with them, is subject to a number of risks which include, among others, market
dynamics, pronouncements of the market regulatory authorities and the development of new
technologies to support the services. These estimates are periodically reviewed on the basis of actual
data in order to ensure that the forecast data remains within reasonably predictable ranges. Not all of
the factors mentioned are under the control of TIM and could therefore have a significant impact on
future forecasts regarding the performance of the contracts, the estimated margin amount (positive or
negative), the cash flows that will be generated.

In addition, competition concerning innovative products and services in TIM’s Italian domestic fixedline, mobile telephony and broadband/UBB businesses, has led and could lead to:

- obsolescence of existing technologies and more rapid deployment of new technologies;

- an increase in costs and payback period related to investments in new technologies that are
necessary to retain customers and market share; and

- difficulties in reducing debt and funding strategic and technological investments if TIM cannot
generate sufficient profits and cash flows.

In the Brazilian market, the competitive risks are represented by the rapid transition of the business
model from traditional to more innovative services. Changes in the consumption profile of the customer
base (voice-to-data migration) require operators to be quick to prepare their infrastructure and
modernize their portfolios of products and services. In this context, the TIM Brasil group could be
impacted by the need for rapid development of technologies and infrastructures.

Competition in TIM’s principal lines of business has led and could lead, to:

- price and margin erosion for its traditional products and services;

- loss of market share in its core markets;

- loss of existing or prospective customers; and

- greater difficulty in retaining existing customers.

Although TIM continues to take steps to realise additional efficiencies and to rebalance its revenue mix
through the continuous introduction of innovative and value-added services, if any or all of the events
described above occur, the impact of such factors could have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations and financial condition of TIM Group.

**_Continuing rapid changes in technologies could increase competition, reduce the usage of traditional_**
**_services and require TIM to make substantial additional investments._**

TIM, like other operators, faces increasing competition from non-traditional data services on new voice
and messaging over-the-internet technologies, in particular OTT applications such as Skype, FaceTime,
Messenger and WhatsApp. These applications are often free of charge, other than charges for data usage


-----

and are accessible via smartphones, tablets and computers. These applications provide users with
potentially unlimited access to messaging and voice services over the internet, bypassing more
expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS, which have historically been a source
of significant revenues for fixed and mobile network operators like TIM. In Italy and Brazil, an
increasing number of customers are using OTT applications services instead of traditional voice and
SMS communications.

Historically, TIM has generated a substantial portion of its revenues from voice and SMS services,
particularly in its mobile business in Italy, and the substitution of data services for these traditional
voice and SMS volumes has had and could continue to have a negative impact.

If non-traditional voice and messaging data services continue to increase in popularity, as they are
expected to, and TIM is unable to address such competition, its ARPU could decline and TIM would
face lower margins across many of its products and services, resulting in a material adverse effect.

**_Alternative infrastructure operators in Italy could pose a threat to TIM, particularly in the medium_**
**_to long term._**

In the fixed market, AltNets, such as Open Fiber S.p.A. (“Open Fiber”), have disclosed and started to
implement plans to develop alternative UBB telecommunications networks in the main Italian cities
and in the so-called “market failure” zones (or white areas), in which no investments by private
operators were present and the UBB infrastructure is being build thanks to direct State intervention.
Similar alternative developments, either on a standalone basis or through partnerships with OLOs, could
adversely impact TIM’s businesses, assets and goodwill and, as a consequence, its economic and
financial performance.

As the development of alternative networks is completed, TIM may face increased competition in the
national Wholesale market segment from OLOs which can purchase connections from AltNets and use
them to offer their own competing services. This could lead to a loss of customers and revenues for
TIM.

**_System and network failures could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could_**
**_harm TIM’s reputation._**

TIM’s success largely depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its IT, network
systems and of certain hardware and datacentres that it manages for its clients. In addition, TIM’s
operations involve daily processing and storage of large amounts of customer data and require
uninterrupted, accurate, permanently available, real-time and safe transmission and storage of customer
and other data in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

TIM’s technical infrastructure (including its network infrastructure for fixed-line and mobile
telecommunications services) and the assets managed on behalf of clients, are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from technology failures, power loss, floods, windstorms, fires, terrorism, intentional
wrongdoing, human error and similar events. Unanticipated problems at TIM’s facilities, system
failures, hardware and software failures, computer viruses and cyber-attacks (information theft, data
corruption, operational disruption or financial loss) and data leakage, as well as terrorist attacks against
its infrastructure could affect the quality of its services and cause service interruptions. Any of these
occurrences could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could negatively affect TIM’s
levels of customer satisfaction, reduce its customer base and harm its reputation.

TIM has implemented processes of vulnerability analysis, development of technical protection
solutions, optimization of capital allocation on technical investments and partial financial transfer of
risk to the insurance market in order to seek to address the risks described above but there can be no
assurance such measures will be sufficient.


-----

**_TIM’s businesses are subject to cybersecurity risks._**

Cybersecurity risks are among the most relevant risks for TIM due to the central role of IT in its
operations.

Despite efforts to modernize the network and replace outdated systems, TIM’s networks and systems
are vulnerable to security threats, including cyber-attacks from internal and external sources. These
attacks can disrupt service availability and compromise data, posing a significant risk to the Group’s
reputation as a provider of critical national infrastructure. TIM works to prevent and limit the impact of
cyber-attacks, but an absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. To address these risks, the Group must
continue to identify and address technical vulnerabilities and weaknesses in its processes and enhance
its ability to detect and respond to incidents. This includes strengthening security in the supply chain
and ensuring the security of cloud services. TIM has also strengthened security measures related to
remote access and teleworking in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A major security incident or business interruption, or non-compliance with laws and regulations, could
result in financial loss, reputational damage, market share loss, and regulatory sanctions.

**_TIM may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully implement its Internet and_**
**_broadband/4.5G/5G NGMN strategy._**

The continuing development of internet and broadband services constitutes a strategic objective for
TIM that aims to increase the use of its networks to offset the continuing decline of traditional voice
services. Its ability to successfully implement this strategy may be negatively affected if:

- broadband mobile coverage does not grow as TIM expects;

- competition grows to include players from adjacent markets or technological developments
introducing new platforms for Internet access and/or Internet distribution;

- it is unable to provide superior broadband connections and broadband/mobile services relative
to its competitors;

- it experiences network interruptions or related capacity problems with network infrastructure;
and

- it is unable to obtain adequate returns from the investments related to its network development.

However, the implementation of 4.5G/5G UBB mobile technologies is dependent on a number of
factors including the availability and selection of cutting-edge technology from TIM’s
network/platforms and device vendors.

If TIM fails to achieve its objectives for the implementation of UBB mobile coverage in a timely
manner, or at all, it may lose market share to its competitors in this strategically important segment.

Any of the above factors may adversely affect the successful implementation of the strategy, business
and results of operations of TIM Group.

**_TIM’s business may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully implement its ICT strategy._**

TIM intends to continue focusing on Information Technology-Telecommunication (“IT-TLC”)
convergence by addressing the ICT market, offering network and infrastructure management, as well
as application management. In particular, as the market for cloud services continues to grow, the ICT
market is expected to become a key element of its strategy.


-----

For this reason, the company Polo Strategico Nazionale (National Strategic Hub – “PSN”) of which
TIM holds 45% of the share capital, was recently established, dealing with the design, preparation,
fitting out and management of infrastructure for the supply of cloud services and solutions for the Italian
Public Administration[5].

TIM anticipates that the competition in this market will intensify as new players, particularly
telecommunications operators collaborating with IT operators, enter the market (see “Market
_competition”)._

**_TIM’s business may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully implement its “UBB fixed access_**
**_network” strategy._**

One of TIM’s goals is to accelerate the roll-out of a new telecommunications network capable of
providing customers with UBB connections, also thanks to the use of public funds linked to the NRRP
in the regions where TIM won the tender.

However, implementation of UBB technologies is dependent on a number of factors including:

- delays in receiving the necessary permissions and authorisations for installation of lines;

- resistance by road administrators to the use of innovative techniques for excavation and the
laying of fibre optic cables;

- delay in supplying of material and devices due to possible supply chain shocks;

- increase in transport, raw materials and labour cost of network companies due to inflationary
pressures and increase in energy costs (see “Risks Relating to Macro-Economic Conditions”);

- delay in the verification and control operation by the SINFI (Sistema Informativo Nazionale
Federato delle Infrastrutture)[6].

If TIM fails to achieve its objectives for the implementation of UBB coverage promptly, or at all, TIM
may lose market share to its competitors in this strategically important segment, which may adversely
impact the TIM Group’s.

In the event of delays in the NRRP tenders, any delay in completing the roll-out is sanctioned through
predetermined penalties which can be very significant and, in case of relevant delay, even result in the
overall revocation of the awarded grant.

**_TIM business may be affected by unpredictable instant increase of traffic._**

Unpredictable instant and massive increases of traffic due to, for example, video live events broadcasted
over the IP network from a OTT and/or CSP, in some case strongly affect the TIM’s network overall
performance (both fixed and mobile) for the duration of the event, causing slowdowns or momentary
blockages of communications with consequences on reputation and customer satisfaction.

5 The acceptance by the TAR (Regional Administrative Court) of the opposition presented by Fastweb on the awarding of the tender won by
TIM/CDP/Leonardo/Sogei does not highlight any risks for the company PSN and the shareholders. In fact, Fastweb would possibly be entitled
to compensation for damages from the Public Administration as the activities are at an advanced level and a review of the results of the tender
could lead to the loss of NRRP funding.
6 SINFI is the tool identified for coordination and transparency for the new Italian broadband and ultra-broadband strategy. Among the
functions it performs is to promote the sharing of infrastructures, through an orderly management of underground and above ground
infrastructure and the related maintenance, and also to offer a single dashboard that efficiently manages and monitors all the maintenance.


-----

**_TIM’s business depends on the upgrading of its existing networks._**

TIM must continue to maintain, improve and upgrade its existing networks in a timely and satisfactory
manner to retain and expand its customer base in each of its markets. A reliable and high-quality
network is necessary to manage turnover by sustaining its customer base, maintaining strong customer
brands and reputation and satisfying regulatory requirements, including minimum service requirements.
The maintenance and improvement of its existing networks depends on its ability to:

- upgrade the functionality of its networks to offer increasingly customised services to its
customers;

- increase coverage in some of its markets;

- expand and optimise customer service, network management and administrative systems;

- expand the capacity of its existing fixed and mobile networks to cope with increased bandwidth
usage; and

- upgrade older systems and networks to adapt them to new technologies and enhance
architecture.

In addition, due to rapid changes in the telecommunications industry, TIM’s network investments may
prove to be inadequate or may be superseded by new technological changes. Its network investments
may also be limited by market uptake and customer acceptance. If TIM fails to make adequate capital
expenditures or investments, or to properly and efficiently allocate such expenditures or investments,
the performance of its networks, could suffer, resulting in lower customer satisfaction, diminution of
brand strength and increased turnover.

Many of these tasks are not entirely under TIM’s control and may be affected by applicable regulation.
If TIM fails to maintain, improve or upgrade its networks, its services and products may be less
attractive to new customers and it may lose existing customers to competitors.

**_TIM’s largest Shareholders; governance complexity._**

TIM’s governance presents a considerable complexity due to the large diffusion of its shareholding on
the market with a continuous change over time. As a result of this complexity, it is possible that the
Group’s strategic and management decisions could be influenced, delayed or hindered, with potential
consequences on the expected economic and financial results.

As of 3 April 2023, the largest shareholders in TIM are Vivendi S.A. which holds 23.75% and Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. which holds 9.81%.

**_Risks related to the main sustainability issues._**

The TIM Group has been actively engaging and consulting with its stakeholders for the purpose of
enhancing its Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) performance for a long time. These
efforts are reflected in the sustainability plan, which is a central part of the TIM Group’s Strategic Plan
and is based on the materiality matrix, which reflects the results of the engagement activity.


-----

Below are the main ESG events and risks with a potential impact on the TIM Group.

**_Climate and Circular economy._**

The TIM Group’s operations and value chain has a negative environmental impact, in particular in terms
of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and of electronic waste (“e-waste”). The majority of GHG
emissions are generated in the supply chain, while e-waste is primarily associated with end of life of
mobile devices, routers and network equipment.

The TIM Group is seeing increasing requirements and expectations from customers, policy makers,
investors and others stakeholders to manage these negative impacts. There is also increasing regulatory
and self-regulatory pressure worldwide in relation to areas such as energy efficiency in datacentres and
extending the lifetime of electronic devices. Such requirements may lead to increased costs for the TIM
Group.

The TIM Group has set itself the goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030, also due to a commitment
to purchase 100% renewable energy by 2025.

Furthermore, the TIM Group has committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 and to reach a 47%
reduction in the emissions of its value chain (Scope 3) relating to the purchase of goods and services,
the purchase of capital goods and the use of products sold to customers.

The worsening of climate change increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events such
as heat waves floods and windstorms which may cause severe disruptions to telecommunications and
ICT services, reduce the work efficiency (hours actually worked), have a consequential impact on the
TIM Group’s business. More extreme weather may also drive the need for additional investments in
cooling technology and other more resilient infrastructure. Failure to implement circular business
models such as offering of products designed with eco-sustainable criteria or the use of recyclable
materials may lead to lost opportunities for cost savings and a failure to realize additional revenues.

Failure to meet stakeholders’ requirements or expectations may lead to reputational loss, loss of
business or limit access to sustainable finance. Increasing electricity prices, the availability of renewable
energy certificates or the possible introduction of carbon taxation could increase operational costs for
the TIM Group.

**_Failure to close the digital divide._**

The digital divide represents a major obstacle to the spread of digitisation and the related connectivity
services with a risk due to the lack of correlation between the offer of advanced TLC products/services
and a demand too tied to traditional products/services.

TIM is highly committed in promoting digital inclusion, in Italy also thanks to NRRP tenders such as
those for _Connected Schools and_ _Digital Health or the PSN project aimed at strengthening the_
digitalization of the Italian public administration.

To promote digital inclusion, TIM also focuses on Digital identity services in Italy: more than five
million active services between certified e-mail address (“PEC”), Digital Signature and Public Digital
Identity System (“SPID”) to allow citizens and businesses to access public administration’s online
services.

Failure to successfully implementing its strategy may lead to a reputational damage even before a
revenues loss.

**_Failure to recruit, retain and engage skilled employees._**


-----

The ability to attract and retain qualified, specialised and motivated personnel is a key success factor
for the pursuit of strategic objectives and the achievement of an adequate level of quality customer
experiences.

The demand and competition for talents in the ICT and Cybersecurity sector is becoming increasingly
challenging. In order to secure the right talent, TIM needs to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled
employees. Failure to recruit, develop and retain necessary skilled employees may impact TIM’s ability
to develop new or high growth business areas and thereby deliver on its strategy as set out in the
Strategic Plan.

**2.** **FINANCIAL RISKS.**

**_TIM’s leverage is such that deterioration in cash flow can change the expectations of its ability to_**
**_repay its debt and the inability to reduce its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business._**
**_Continuing volatility in international credit markets may limit TIM’s ability to refinance its financial_**
**_debt._**

As of 31 December 2022, TIM’s consolidated Gross Financial Debt was 32,245 million euro, compared
to 34,097 million euro on 31 December 2021. Its Consolidated Net Financial Debt Carrying Amount
was 25,370 million euro as of 31 December 2022, compared to 22,416 million euro as of 31 December
2021. TIM’s high leverage continues to be a factor in its strategic decisions as it has been for a number
of years and the reduction of its leverage remains a key strategic objective. As a result, however, TIM
is reliant on cost-cutting to finance critical technology improvements and upgrades to its network,
although it is taking steps to raise additional capital to support critical investment.

Due to the competitive environment and the continuing weak economic conditions, there could be
deterioration in TIM’s income statement and financial measures used by rating agencies, such as
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, to assess its ability to repay its debt and determine its credit quality. Although
rating downgrades do not generally have an immediate impact on outstanding debt, other than
outstanding debt instruments for which the interest expense is specifically impacted by such ratings,
downgrades could adversely impact its ability to refinance existing debt and could increase costs related
to refinancing existing debt and managing its derivatives portfolio.

Factors that are beyond TIM’s control such as deterioration in the telecommunications sector,
unfavourable fluctuations in interest rates and/or exchange rates, further disruptions in the capital
markets, particularly debt capital markets and continuing weakness in general economic conditions at
the national level could have a significant effect on its ability to reduce its debt and refinance existing
debt through further access to the financial markets. Because debt reduction is one of TIM’s strategic
objectives, failure to reduce debt could be viewed negatively and could adversely affect its credit
ratings.

The management and development of TIM’s business will require significant investments. If it is unable
to finance its capital investments, TIM may need to incur additional debt in order to finance such
investment. Its future results of operations may be influenced by its ability to enter into such
transactions, which, in turn, will be determined by market conditions and factors that are outside its
control. In addition, if such transactions increase its leverage, it could adversely affect its credit ratings.

Any failure by TIM to make any of its scheduled debt repayments, or to reschedule such debt on
favourable terms, would have a material adverse effect on TIM Group, its business prospects, its
financial condition and its results of operations.


-----

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates and the performance of the equity markets in_**
**_general may adversely affect TIM’s results._**

In the past, TIM has made substantial international investments, significantly expanding its operations
outside of the Euro zone, particularly in Latin America.

TIM’s non-current operating assets are located as follows:

- Italy: as of 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, respectively, 40,495 million euro (83.1%
of total non-current operating assets) and 40,542 million euro (87.9% of total non-current
operating assets); and

- Outside of Italy: as of 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, respectively, 8,225 million
euro (16.9% of total non-current operating assets) and 5,597 million euro (12.1% of total noncurrent operating assets). Non-current operating assets outside of Italy are primarily
denominated in Brazilian Reais.

TIM generally hedges its foreign exchange exposure but does not cover conversion risk relating to its
foreign subsidiaries. According to its policies, the hedging of the foreign exchange exposure related to
the financial liabilities is mandatory. Movements in the euro exchange rates relative to other currencies
(particularly the Brazilian Real) may adversely affect its consolidated results. A rise in the value of the
euro relative to other currencies in certain countries in which TIM operates or have made investments
will reduce the relative value of the revenues or assets of its operations from those countries and,
therefore, may adversely affect its operating results or financial position.

In addition, TIM has raised, and may raise an increasing proportion, financing in currencies other than
the euro, principally U.S. dollars and British pound sterling. In accordance with its risk management
policies, TIM generally hedges the foreign currency risk exposure related to non-euro denominated
liabilities, through cross-currency and interest rate swaps. However, hedging instruments may not be
successful in protecting the TIM Group effectively from adverse exchange rate movements.

Furthermore, TIM is exposed to interest rates risk on that portion of its consolidated gross debt which
is subject to the accrual of interest at floating rates; this portion represents approximately 35% of the
total medium/long term consolidated debt (after lease view) as of 31 December 2022.

The decision to keep such a fixed-floating rate debt structure goes towards the goal to minimise negative
interests’ impact and is partially implemented through derivatives instruments whereby fixed rate
liabilities are synthetically converted in floating rate ones. Any changes in interest rates that have not
been adequately hedged by derivative contracts may result in increased financial liabilities in
connection with TIM’s floating rate debt, which may have adverse effects on the results of its operations
and cash flows.

An increase of sovereign spreads, and of the default risk they reflect, in the countries where TIM
operates, may affect the value of its assets in such countries.

TIM may also be exposed to financial risks such as those related to the performance of the equity
markets in general, and, more specifically, risks related to the performance of the share price of TIM
Group companies.

The TIM Group may be exposed to financial risks such as those deriving from fluctuations of interest
and exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and general trend risks of the relevant stock markets and more specifically - risks linked to the stock price developments of shares of TIM Group’s subsidiaries.
Such risks can have a negative impact on the financial results and structure of the TIM Group.


-----

Therefore, in order to manage such risks, the TIM Group has established the following guidelines to be
followed in: (i) operational management; (ii) identification of the financial instruments most suitable to
meet the objectives set; and (iii) monitoring the results achieved. In particular, and in order to mitigate
the liquidity risk, the TIM Group aims to maintain an “adequate level of financial flexibility”, in terms
of cash and committed syndicated credit lines, covering the refinancing needs for the next 12-18 months
at least.

Any significant increase in interest rates could therefore lead to an increase in TIM Group’s debt service
expenses, which would have a material adverse effect on the TIM Group, its business prospects, its
financial condition and its results of operations.

**3.** **RISKS RELATING TO MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.**

TIM’s international presence enables the diversification of its activities across various countries, but it
also exposes the Group to diverse legislation, as well as to the political developments and economic
environments of the countries in which it operates. Any adverse developments in this regard, including
exchange rate or sovereign-risk fluctuations, as well as growing geopolitical tensions, may adversely
affect TIM’s expected results due to their influence on customers’ spending capacity and on the cost
saving objectives set in the Strategic Plan.

**_Geopolitical uncertainty, specifically the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has increased TIM’s risk profile_**
**_due to the economic prospects in the countries where it operates._**

The Ukraine-Russia conflict have uncertain implications that should become clearer over time. At the
moment the most visible impact of the geopolitical situation on the Group’s business is mainly of an
indirect nature resulting in a dramatic increase in energy raw materials and transport costs.

In the event that the military, economic and political tensions continue to rise, the situation could have
severe global consequences imposing a serious threat to the global security which could raise and
intensify risks for the Group. These risks include the safety and security of the Group’s workforce, the
possibility that cyber-attacks could affect the Group’s networks and data or those of its customers, an
increase in the likelihood of a supply chain shock that would result in higher inflation in the short and
medium term.

The Group has no physical presence in Ukraine and has a very small presence in Russia thought its
subsidiary TI Sparkle. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has enacted and implemented
a comprehensive set of sanctions and measures and could enact and implement wider sanctions on
Russia, Russian citizens or Russian companies. The Group has implemented measures to monitor and
comply with these sanctions. In respect of the possible impact of such sanctions for the Group and in
particular for TI Sparkle, there could be an adverse impact in commercial relations, although there have
been none to date, in the collection of trade receivables and on the assets present in the country as well
as on the timeframe for the implementation of international investment projects, the valorisation of
which, although still dependent on how the situation develops, is currently considered not significant
by TIM.

**_There is a significant risk that Italy’s solid economic growth in 2022 will experience a significant_**
**_slowdown._**

In the fourth quarter of 2022 Italy’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) decreased by 0.1% with respect
to the previous quarter. Notably a 0.5 % advance in government expenditure was not enough to offset
the 1.6 % drop in household consumption. Gross fixed investments expanded by 2.0%, thanks also to
the NRRP measures meant to stimulate Italian firms’ competitiveness. Conversely imports decreased
by 1.7% while exports grew by 2.6% contributing positively and mitigating the overall GDP
contraction.


-----

The reopening of the Italian economy, after lifting all COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, and the
policy measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on firms and households as well as a
buoyant tourism season all contributed to the solid growth (close to + 3.7%) expected for the whole
2022.

However, in management’s view, benefits in reopening the Italian economy have now almost run their
course. Fiscal policies aimed at mitigating the economic and social impact of high energy prices do not
and cannot address the causes of rising inflation rates and, due to their high cost, cannot be prolonged
indeterminately. Also the stimulus provided by the construction sector supported by generous
refurbishing and building renovations incentives is expected to weaken.

The latest European Commission estimates indicate Italian GDP is set to grow respectively by 0.8% in
2023 and 1.0% in 2024 (sources: European Commission IQ 2023).

**_The Inflation pressure and the rising input and borrowing costs may cause a slowdown in Italy’s_**
**_employment rate and ultimately in the TIM’s consumers’ demand._**

The Italian economy is facing significant risks due to an energy price shock and high inflation. The
inflation rate in Italy, which has recently reached record highs of almost 12%, is putting pressure on
real disposable incomes and weakening purchasing power, negatively impacting internal demand. If
wages adapt to the new level of prices within a reasonable time lag (a number of wage agreements were
concluded before the energy price shock commenced) and price pressures ease, private consumption
may pick up again in 2024.

High input costs and a prolonged tightening of financing conditions triggered by the more stringent
monetary policies introduced by the major central banks to fight inflation will likely negatively affect
corporate investments. The housing market will also be negatively impacted. Government capital
spending (on the back of NRRP fund financed investment) is instead expected to remain robust.
Significant increase in interest expenditure and the need for fiscal discipline is expected to reduce this
stimulus.

Labour demand is already decreasing in more energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and
construction, but employment growth has also slowed down in the retail and tourism sector. In January
2023 the unemployment rate in Italy slightly rose from 7.8% to 7.9% (sources: ISTAT report dated 3
_March 2023)._

The above factors are affecting the spending capacity of TIM’s consumer and business customers
leading to weaker demand, customers being less willing to pay for premium services and an increase in
the risk of bad debts, which could each result in a reduction in the Group’s revenue and/or profit.

**_Risks related to the Brazilian Economy: weaker global demand and high inflation._**

In 2022 the Brazilian economy grew by nearly 3 percentage points also thanks to strong consumer
spending (sources: Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE). High commodity prices
have supported growth in Brazil, as the country has received higher prices for its substantial exports of
oil, iron ore, and agricultural commodities. Unfortunately, the weaker global economic environment
and the prospect of a global recession are lowering both prices and demand for Brazilian exports. The
economy is also struggling with high inflation and higher interest rates that come with it. Although
inflation has begun to ease and the central bank has paused its interest rate hikes for now, next year the
economy is expected to slow down. The war in Ukraine and the global economic outlook are highly
uncertain factors that will ultimately determine the cost of energy worldwide and in Brazil. Considering
the high level of private (households) and public (government) debt the monetary policy the central
bank will be forced to implement to tackle inflation, will strongly influence the Brazilian economy as
well as the Brazilian reais exchange rate.


-----

The scenario described could affect the Issuer’s risk profile worsening the market and financial risks of
the subsidiary TIM Brasil with a potential impact on revenue and financial objectives.

**_Unexpected and uncertain events, such as the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, could_**
**_significantly affect the Group’s operations._**

Although the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic may have passed, the possibility of new outbreaks of
the pandemic due to new variants of COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded. This could affect the
TIM Group’s operations. This could include, but is not limited to, a decline of roaming volumes, lower
subscriber growth, increasing bad debt of business and consumer subscribers. As COVID-19 continues
to spread, it is expected to have significant negative effects on network improvements and maintenance,
procurement and the supply chain. As other similar pandemic outbreaks are possible in the future,
similar effects could impact TIM at any time resulting in decreasing margins, lower revenues or delays
in cash flows.

**4.** **RISKS RELATED TO THE LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK.**

**_Because TIM operates in a heavily regulated industry, regulatory decisions and changes in the_**
**_regulatory environment could adversely affect its business._**

TIM’s fixed and mobile telecommunications operations, in Italy and abroad, are subject to regulatory
requirements. As a member of the EU, Italy has adapted its regulatory legislation and rules for electronic
communications services to the framework established by the EU Parliament and Council.

Pursuant to the EU regulatory framework, the Italian regulator, _Autorità per le Garanzie nelle_
_Comunicazioni (“AGCom”), is required to identify operators with “Significant Market Power”_
(“SMP”) in the relevant markets subject to regulation. On the basis of market analyses proceedings
(“Market Analyses”), AGCom imposes requirements necessary to address identified competition
problems. Current requirements are mainly focused on the regulation of TIM’s wholesale business,
while the regulation of retail markets has been largely withdrawn, with the exception of price tests on
retail access offers (for telephone, broadband and UBB services).

Within this regulatory framework, the main risks TIM faces include the lack of predictability
concerning both the timing of the regulatory proceedings and their final outcome and possible AGCom
decisions that apply retroactively and their potential impact on expected TIM Group’s results and on
the guidance presented to the market (e.g., review of prices from prior years following the decisions of
administrative courts, repricing decisions, proceedings that impact technological decisions and return
on investment).

In principle, a new “round” of Market Analyses should be conducted by AGCom every three years, in
order to deal with the evolution of market conditions and technology developments and set the rules for
the subsequent three-year period. However, the regulatory review process does not always follow the
expected schedule.

Regulation is a key factor in evaluating the likelihood of return on investments and therefore in deciding
where to invest. Regulatory uncertainty and regulatory changes imposed on TIM can impact its
revenues and can make it more difficult to make important investment decisions.

Moreover, a high level of disputes arising from operators challenging AGCom decisions before
administrative courts results in an even greater degree of uncertainty with respect to rules and economic
requirements.

The Italian Antitrust Authority, Autorità Garante per la Concorrenza ed il Mercato (“AGCM”) and
AGCom, may also intervene in TIM’s business, setting fines and/or imposing changes in its service


-----

provision operating processes and in its offers. In addition, AGCom or AGCM decisions may impose
constraints on the pricing of fixed and mobile offers based on consumer protection legislation.

The TIM Brasil Business Unit is also subject to extensive regulation. Its international operations,
therefore, face similar regulatory issues as TIM faces in Italy, including the possibility for regulators to
impose obligations and conditions on how TIM operates its businesses in Brazil as well as taking
decisions that can have an adverse effect on its results.

As a result, the decisions of regulators or the implementation of new regulations in Brazil and the costs
of its compliance with any such decisions or new regulations, may limit its flexibility in responding to
market conditions, competition and changes in its cost base which could individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.

Due to the continuous evolution of the regulatory regime affecting various parts of its business in Italy
and in its international operations, TIM is unable to clearly predict the impact of any proposed or
potential changes in the regulatory environment in which it operates in Italy, Brazil and its other
international markets. Regulations in the telecommunications industry are constantly changing to adapt
to new competition and technology. Changes in laws, regulation or government policy could adversely
affect TIM’s business and competitiveness. In particular, TIM’s ability to compete effectively in its
existing or new markets could be adversely affected if regulators decide to expand the restrictions and
obligations to which it is subject or extend them to new services and markets. Finally, decisions by
regulators regarding the granting, amendment or renewal of its authorisations, or those of third parties,
could adversely affect its future operations in Italy and in other countries where TIM operates.

**_The Italian government has exercised, and may in the future exercise, its significant powers with_**
**_respect to TIM, including with respect to TIM’s ability to enter into strategic transactions._**

In 2012, regulations relating to the special powers regarding strategic assets in the energy, transport and
communications sectors were published and became effective (Law Decree no. 21 of 15 March 2012,
adopted with modifications by Law no. 56 of 11 May 2012 (the “Golden Power Decree”)).

Article 1 of the Golden Power Decree (which refers to strategic assets for the defence and national
security sector) grants the Italian government:

- the power to impose conditions and possibly to oppose the purchase of shareholdings by parties
other than the Italian state, Italian public entities and other parties controlled by the same, so
long as the stake is sufficient to compromise the interests of national defence and security. Until
expiry of the period of time within which conditions may be imposed, or the power to oppose
the acquisition exercised, any rights other than ownership rights connected to the relevant
shares are suspended. Such rights are suspended in case of non-compliance with or breach of
any condition imposed on the purchaser, for as long as the non-compliance or breach persists.
Any shareholders’ resolution adopted with the relevant shares providing the decisive votes, as
well as any resolution or act adopted that breaches or does not comply with any condition
imposed, is null and void; and

- veto power (including through the imposition of obligations or conditions) regarding any
resolution (by either shareholders’ meeting or the administrative bodies of the company) on any
merger, demerger, transfer of business unit, relocation of registered office to outside Italy,
change of corporate purpose or winding up of the company. Any resolution or act adopted in
breach of these obligations is null and void. The government may also order TIM and any other
party to restore the original condition.

Article 2 of the Golden Power Decree (which refers to strategic assets in the communications sector)
grants the Italian government:


-----

- the power to impose conditions and possibly oppose the purchase, under certain conditions, by
non-EU entities, of controlling stakes in companies that hold the aforementioned types of
assets. Until the end of a 15-day period from the notice of such purchase, during which the
government may impose conditions or oppose the proposed purchase, voting rights (and any
rights other than the property rights) connected to shares resulting in the change of control, are
suspended. Such rights are suspended in the case of any non-compliance with or breach of the
conditions imposed on the purchaser for as long as the non-compliance or breach persists. Any
shareholders’ resolution adopted with the relevant shares providing the decisive votes, as well
as any resolution or act adopted those breaches or does not comply with any condition imposed,
is null and void;

- veto power (including through the imposition of obligations or conditions) regarding any
resolution, act or transaction that has the effect of modifying the ownership, control or
availability of such strategic assets or changing their location, including resolutions on any
merger, demerger, transfer of registered office to outside Italy, transfer of the company or a
business unit which contains the strategic assets, or their assignment by way of guarantee. Any
resolution or act in breach of such obligations is null and void. The government may also order
the company and any other party to restore the original condition at its own expense.

In October and November 2017, the government designated certain of TIM’s assets as strategic within
the meaning of the above-described provisions of the Golden Power Decree and imposed various
governance and organisational obligations and restrictions on TIM.

By Legislative Decree No 21 of 21 March 2022 (Urgent measures to counter the economic and
humanitarian effects of the Ukrainian crisis), converted with amendments by Law No 51 of 20 May
2022, Article 1bis of Legislative Decree No 21/2012 was amended, requiring companies to notify the
Government in advance, of an Annual Plan of purchases of goods and services relating to the design,
implementation, maintenance and management of activities regarding 5G technology. The plan is
subject to approval by the Government, possibly with the imposition of prescriptions or conditions.

The Golden Power legislation, within the framework of the provisions on National Security, has been
supplemented by the legislation relating to the Cybernetic National Security Perimeter, established by
Law No 133 of 18 November 2019, on the basis of which, TIM, as a strategic operator, is required to
adopt security measures in order to ensure high levels of security for ICT goods (networks, information
systems and IT services) of public administrations, public and private bodies and operators, as well as
to notify security incidents and to carry out secure entrustment when supplying ICT goods/services
within the Perimeter itself.

The exercise of special powers by the Government under the Golden Power Decree, or the mere
provision of such powers, could, on the one hand, limit TIM’s autonomy in carrying out its business in
the context of strategic services, but, on the other hand, TIM, being a strategic operator, can guarantee
advantages to its shareholders: (I) being more complex a possible change of controlling interests of
TIM, thus protecting the investments; (II) ensuring a higher level of security of strategic assets and
services.

**_TIM operates under authorisations granted by government authorities and has to satisfy certain_**
**_obligations in order to maintain such authorisations._**

Many of TIM’s activities require authorisations from governmental authorities both in Italy and abroad.
These authorisations specify the types of services the operating company holding such authorisation
may provide. The continued existence and terms of TIM’s authorisations are subject to review by
regulatory authorities and to interpretation, modification or termination by these authorities. In addition,
its current authorisations to provide networks and services require that TIM satisfies certain obligations,
including minimum specified quality levels, service and coverage conditions. Failure to comply with


-----

these obligations could result in the imposition of fines or even in the revocation or forfeiture of the
authorisation. In addition, the need to meet scheduled deadlines may require it to expend more resources
than otherwise budgeted for a particular network build-out.

Additional authorisations may also be required if TIM expands its services into new product areas, and
such authorisations may be related to auctions (e.g. in the assignment of spectrum right of use) or
otherwise prove expensive or require significant cash outlays, or have certain terms and conditions,
such as requirements related to coverage and pricing, with which TIM may not have previously had to
comply. In Brazil, TIM also operates under an authorisation’s regime and, as a result, it is obliged to
maintain minimum quality and service standards. In December 2019, Anatel approved the new
Telecommunications Services Quality Regulation (“RQUAL”), based on responsive regulation. In this
new model, quality is measured on the basis on three main indicators – a Service Quality Index, a
Perceived Quality Index and User Complaints Index - and operators are classified into five categories
(A to E). Based on this regulation, Anatel will be able to take measures according to the specific cases,
such as consumer compensation, the adoption of an action plan or adoption of precautionary measures
to ensure quality standard improvements, generating a risk of impact on the amount of planned
investments, on expected revenues as well as potential penalties.

After a joint effort by Anatel, operators and the Quality Assurance Support Authority (“ESAQ”) to
define the objectives, criteria and reference values of indicators at the end of November 2021, Anatel’s
board of directors formalized the reference documents that anchor this regulation: the Operational
Manual and the Reference Values; and stipulated the entry into operational effectiveness in 1 March
2022, as well as the disclosure of official indexes, and the Quality Seal (inducing competition for
quality) at the beginning of 2023, considering the results of the new monitored indicators in the 2nd
semester of 2022. Until then, Anatel will continue to monitor the old indicators. The evolution of the
monitoring system entails greater attention and effort on the part of the subsidiary TIM Brasil with a
potential negative impact on investment and cost saving objectives.

**_TIM’s activities could be materially negatively affected by failure to comply General Data Protection_**
**_Regulation UE 2016/679 (“GDPR”), and Italian Privacy Code._**

TIM has executed a deep gap analysis, identified the main issues, and consequently planned and
deployed a master plan to reach full compliance with the GDPR requirements as well as with Legislative
Decree 196/2003 and subsequent amendments (the “Italian Privacy Code”).

TIM constantly monitors regulatory developments, measures and opinions adopted by the Italian Data
Protection Authority (“GPDP”) and adopts all the necessary initiatives needed to fulfil compliance with
the aforementioned provisions. TIM, in this context, is also committed in maintaining and verifying
continuously the effectiveness of the adopted controls.

However, the risk of deficiencies in implementing security measures, in fulfilling legal requirements on
data treatment, in applying rules on data retention, in notifying data breaches within the narrow
mandatory timeframes could lead to disputes with data protection authority and to be sanctioned with
heavy fines. Moreover, the risk of personal data breaches with respect to personal information can lead
to quarrels with the interested data subjects and damage to TIM’s reputation, affecting our business.

**_Actual or perceived health risks or other problems relating to mobile handsets or transmission masts_**
**_could lead to litigation or decreased mobile communications usage._**

The effects of, and any damage caused by, exposure to an electromagnetic field were and are the subject
of careful evaluations by the international scientific community, but until now there is no scientific
evidence of harmful effects on health. TIM cannot rule out that exposure to electromagnetic fields or
other emissions originating from wireless handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future.


-----

TIM’s mobile communications business may be harmed as a result of these alleged health risks. For
example, the perception of these health risks could result in a lower number of customers, reduced usage
per customer or potential consumer liability. In addition, although Italian law already imposes strict
limits in relation to transmission equipment, these concerns may cause regulators to impose greater
restrictions on the construction of radio base station towers or other infrastructure, which may hinder
the completion of network build-outs and the commercial availability of new services and may require
additional investments.

**_TIM faces the risk that its organisational policies and procedures embodied in the organisational_**
**_model prepared pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 may fail to prevent certain officers_**
**_and employees from engaging in unlawful conduct, for which it would be jointly liable._**

TIM has put in place an organisational model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001, in order
to create a system of rules capable of preventing certain forms of unlawful conduct by senior
management, executives and employees generally that might result in liabilities for it. The
organisational model is adopted by TIM and by its Italian subsidiaries. A specific version of the
organisational model has been adopted by TIM S.A. pursuant to the anti-corruption Brazilian law (Law
12.846/13).

The organisational model is continuously reviewed and must be kept up to date to reflect changes in
operations and in the regulatory environment. TIM has established a 231 Steering Committee
(management committee composed of Group Compliance Officer, the Chief Human Resources &
Organization Office, the General Counsel and the Audit Director as listener) to prepare and consider
proposals for changes to the model, for submission to the Board of Directors for approval.

Notwithstanding the existence of this model or any updates that TIM may make to it, there can be no
assurances that the model will function as designed, or that it will be considered adequate by any
relevant legal authority. If the model is inadequate or deemed to be so, and TIM was held liable for acts
committed by its senior management, executives and employees or are found otherwise non-compliant
with the requirements of the legislation, TIM may be ordered to pay a fine, its authorisations, licenses
or concessions may be suspended or revoked, and TIM may be prohibited from conducting business,
contracting with the Italian public administration, or advertising goods and services.

**5.** **RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

**_TIM is continuously involved in disputes and litigation with regulators, competition authorities,_**
**_competitors and other parties and is the subject of a number of investigations by judicial authorities._**
**_The ultimate outcome of such proceedings is generally uncertain. If any of these matters are resolved_**
**_against it, they could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of_**
**_operations, financial condition and cash flows in any particular period._**

TIM is subject to numerous risks relating to legal, tax, competition and regulatory proceedings in which
it is currently a party or which could develop in the future. It is also the subject of a number of
investigations by judicial authorities. Such proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable.
Legal, tax, competition and regulatory proceedings and investigations in which TIM is, or may become,
involved (or settlements thereof) may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
on TIM’s results of operations and/or financial condition and cash flows in any particular period.
Furthermore, its involvement in such proceedings and investigations may adversely affect its reputation.

If TIM, or another TIM Group company, faces an adverse decision in any of the legal proceedings to
which it is a party, and is ordered to pay amounts greater than what it has recognised to cover potential
liabilities, it may face adverse effects with respect to it and/or the TIM Group’s operations, financial
position, income statement and cash flows.


-----

The final outcomes of those proceedings are generally uncertain. As of 31 December 2022, TIM had,
on a consolidated basis, recognised liabilities totalling 279 million euros for those disputes where the
risk of losing the case is considered probable. In recognising these liabilities, it took into consideration
the risks connected with each dispute and the relevant accounting standards, which require reserves to
be recognised where liabilities are probable and can be estimated reliably. The provisions represent an
estimate of the financial risk connected with the particular proceedings, in line with the relevant
accounting standards. Nonetheless, TIM may be obligated to meet liabilities linked to unsuccessful
outcomes for proceedings that were not taken into consideration when calculating those reserves and
the provisions made may not be sufficient to fully meet such obligations through use of its reserves.

**_Risks associated with the use of internet by TIM’s customers could cause it to suffer losses and_**
**_adversely affect its reputation._**

Pursuant to applicable Italian regulation, TIM, as a host and provider of data transmission services, is
required to inform competent authorities without delay of any alleged illegal or illicit activity by its
customers of which it is aware. TIM must also provide the authorities with any information it has
identifying such customers. Any failure to comply with this obligation could cause it to become
involved in civil proceedings or could harm public perception of its brand and services. Any such event
could result in legal and/or regulatory proceedings.

**_TIM is exposed to the risk of labour disputes, in particular as a result of its plan to restructure its_**
**_labour costs._**

The acceleration in technological transformation in the telecommunications sector has created the need
to address integrated organisational review activities, digitalisation of processes and adaptation of the
skills and capabilities of all staff members.

In support of the corporate transformation process and the necessary updating of the technicalprofessional skills of TIM’s people, as well as the need to acquire professional profiles compatible with
the reorganisation plan, on 5 August 2022 the Expansion Agreement, introduced to support the
technological development processes of companies, tailored for employment safeguard (the
“Agreement”) was signed by the government.

The Agreement defines the measures to support the objectives of the 2022–2024 Industrial Plan to
empower TIM and certain companies of the TIM Group (TI Sparkle S.p.A., Telecontact S.p.A., Noovle
S.p.A. (“Noovle”), Olivetti S.p.A. (“Olivetti”)) and involves about 30,000 TIM Group employees and
it is based on 4 pillars:

(i) recruitment plan: targeting to hiring of specific roles and skills;

(ii) retirement plan: early retirement plan;

(iii) training and retraining project: both reskilling and paths aimed at acquiring news skills;

(iv) working hours reduction.

Overall, TIM has a relatively good relationship with its workers and trade unions. However, in 2022,
there were national strikes in Italy organized by trade unions against the 2022 – 2024 Industrial Plan,
which was designed to streamline TIM’s operations.

**RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE NOTES**

**Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Notes**

**_Independent review and advice._**

Each prospective investor in the Further Notes must determine, based on its own independent review
and such professional advice as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that its acquisition of the
Further Notes is fully consistent with its financial needs, objectives and condition, complies and is fully
consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and is a fit, proper
and suitable investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or
holding the Notes.

Each prospective investor should consult its own advisers as to legal, tax and related aspects of an
investment in the Further Notes. A prospective investor may not rely on the Issuer or the Physical
Bookrunner or any of their respective affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality of
its acquisition of the Further Notes or as to the other matters referred to above.

**_The Further Notes are complex instruments that are not suitable for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Further Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of
its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

- have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Further
Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Further Notes and the information contained or
incorporated by reference in this Information Memorandum or any applicable supplement;

- have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Further Notes and the impact the Further
Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

- have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Further Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from
the potential investor’s currency (see also “—Risks relating to the market generally—If an
_investor holds Notes which are not denominated in the investor’s home currency, he will be_
_exposed to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value of his holding. In_
_addition, the imposition of exchange controls in relation to any Notes could result in an investor_
_not receiving payments on those Notes”);_

- understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant
indices and financial markets; and

- be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for
economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear
the applicable risks.

Potential investors should not invest in the Further Notes unless they have the expertise (either alone or
with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions,
the resulting effects on the value of such Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential
investor’s overall investment portfolio. The investment activities of investors are subject to applicable
investment laws and regulations and/or review or regulation by certain authorities and each potential
investor should consult its legal advisers or the appropriate regulators.


-----

The Notes contain an optional redemption feature, which is likely to limit their market value. During
any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will
not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any
redemption period.

The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest
rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor would generally not be able to reinvest the redemption
proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may
only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk
in light of other investments available at that time.

**_Legality of Purchase._**

Neither the Issuer, the Physical Bookrunner nor any of their respective affiliates has or assumes
responsibility for the lawfulness of the acquisition of the Further Notes by a prospective investor,
whether under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or the jurisdiction in which it operates (if
different), or for compliance by that prospective investor with any law, regulation or regulatory policy
applicable to it.

**_Interest rate risks._**

Investment in the Further Notes, which bear a fixed rate of interest, involves the risk that if market
interest rates subsequently increase above the rate paid on the Notes, this will adversely affect the value
of the Notes. While the nominal interest rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the
life of such security or during a certain period of time, market interest rates typically change on a daily
basis. As market interest rates change, the price of such security changes in the opposite direction. If
market interest rates increase, the price of such security typically falls, until the yield of such security
is approximately equal to the prevailing market interest rate. Conversely, if market interest rates fall,
the price of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases, until the yield of such security is
approximately equal to the prevailing market interest rate. Investors should be aware that the market
price of the Notes may fall as a result of movements in market interest rates.

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if the TIM Group’s creditworthiness deteriorates._**

The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives the TIM Group to be less likely to
fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because
of the crystallization of any of the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section. Even if the TIM Group’s
ability to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased,
market participants could nevertheless have a different perception. In addition, market participants’
estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same
business as the TIM Group could adversely change, thereby causing the market value of the Notes to
fall. If any of these events occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower
price than before the crystallization of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the
Notes could decrease.

**_Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Further Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. An investment in the Further Notes
denominated in a currency other than the currency by reference to which Noteholders measure the return
on their investments will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, amongst other factors, possible
significant changes in the value of the euro relative to other relevant currencies because of economic,
political or other factors over which the Issuer has no control. Depreciation of the euro against other
relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon
rates and could result in a loss to Noteholders when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency


-----

by reference to which Noteholders measure the return on their investments. There may be tax
consequences for prospective investors as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any
investment in the Further Notes. Please see “Taxation”.

In addition, despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns
persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial
obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other
concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in
more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve
entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be
determined by laws in effect at such time. The Issuer cannot assure that the official exchange rate at
which the Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value in euro. These potential
developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely
affect the value of the Notes.

**Risks relating to the TIM Group’s Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_The substantial leverage and debt service obligations of the TIM Group could adversely affect its_**
**_business and may prevent the Issuer from fulfilling its obligations, including its payment obligations_**
**_under the Notes._**

The TIM Group currently has, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of 31 December 2022, the
TIM Group had €32,245 million of gross financial debt (including lease liabilities of €5,467 million).
In addition, the TIM Group’s revolving credit facilities provide for additional borrowings up to an
aggregate of €4,000 million, subject to certain conditions, which were unutilised on 31 December 2022.
See “Capitalisation” and “Description of Certain Other Financing Arrangements”. The TIM Group
anticipates that its high leverage will continue to exist for the foreseeable future and the covenants under
the Notes and other existing financing arrangements will provide the TIM Group with significant
flexibility to incur additional debt.

Its significant leverage could have important consequences for the TIM Group’s business and
operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes and its
and its Subsidiaries’ other debts and liabilities, including in respect of bonds and credit facilities
maturing prior to the maturity date of the Notes;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the
repayment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of
such cash flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing, to fund capital
expenditures, working capital, acquisitions, joint ventures, or other general corporate purposes;

- increasing its vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, a downturn in its
business or general economic or industry conditions;

- placing the TIM Group at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower
leverage or greater financial resources;

- limiting its flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in its business and
industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with its creditors;


-----

- increasing its exposure to interest rate increases because some of its indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest; and

- limiting, among other things, its ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the
future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the TIM Group’s
business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy its debt obligations,
including the Notes.

For further information regarding the TIM Group’s substantial leverage and for more information about
its indebtedness that will remain outstanding following the consummation of the Transactions, see also
“Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalisation” and “Description of Certain Other Financing Arrangements”.

**_The Issuer and its Subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it_**
**_difficult for it to service its debt, including the Notes, and impair its ability to operate its business._**

The TIM Group may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in connection with
future acquisitions.

The Conditions of the Further Notes do not contain any restriction on the amount of unsecured
indebtedness which the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may from time to time incur. In the event of any
insolvency or winding-up of the Issuer, the Notes will rank equally with the Issuer’s other unsecured
senior indebtedness and, accordingly, any increase in the amount of the Issuer’s unsecured senior
indebtedness in the future may reduce the amount recoverable by Noteholders.

The Conditions of the Further Notes will permit its Subsidiaries to incur additional debt as well. See
also “—The Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the TIM
_Group’s Subsidiaries”. Moreover, debt of the TIM Group may incur in the future could mature prior to_
the Notes.

In addition, the Notes are unsecured and, save as provided in Condition 3.1 (Covenants – Restrictions
_on Security Interests), do not contain any restriction on the giving of security by the Issuer over present_
and future indebtedness. Where security has been granted over assets of the Issuer to secure
indebtedness, in the event of any insolvency or winding-up of the Issuer, such indebtedness will rank
in priority over the Notes and other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer in respect of such assets. See
“—Claims of secured creditors of the Issuer, if any, will have priority with respect to their collateral
_over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the_
_assets securing such indebtedness.”_

If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its Subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that the
Issuer now faces would increase. In addition, the Conditions of the Further Notes will not prevent the
Issuer from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements, including trade
payables. The TIM Group’s inability to service its debt could have a material adverse effect on its
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and the Issuer’s ability to fulfil its
obligations under the Notes.

**_The Issuer may be unable to raise the funds necessary to refinance indebtedness maturing prior to_**
**_the stated maturity of the Notes or to repay the Notes at maturity._**

The Notes will mature on 15 February 2028. As at 31 December 2022 upcoming maturities of financial
liabilities of the TIM Group (after lease) amounted to €3.4 billion in 2023 (including a repayment of
bonds in a principal amount of €1,000 million made on 16 January 2023), €4.4 billion in 2024, €3.4
billion in 2025, €4.0 billion in 2026, and €2.0 billion in 2027. In addition, the TIM Group’s other


-----

indebtedness may be terminated or become repayable prior to the respective maturities of the Notes.
See”— _The TIM Group will require a significant amount of cash to service its debt and sustain its_
_operations, which it may not be able to generate or raise. The terms of the TIM Group’s borrowings_
_could materially adversely affect its financial condition.”. As a result, the Issuer may not have sufficient_
cash to repay all amounts owing on the Notes at maturity, since the prior maturity of such other
indebtedness may make it difficult to refinance the Notes. In addition, if the Issuer’s access to capital
markets or its ability to enter new financing arrangements is reduced for any reason, it may not be able
to refinance its existing debt on satisfactory terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect
on the TIM Group’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_The TIM Group will require a significant amount of cash to service its debt and sustain its operations,_**
**_which it may not be able to generate or raise. The terms of the TIM Group’s borrowings could_**
**_materially adversely affect its financial condition._**

The TIM Group’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt will depend on its future operating
performance and ability to generate cash from operations. The TIM Group’s ability to generate cash
from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory
factors and other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors”, many of which are beyond its control. It
may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service its
debt or to fund future capital expenditure, acquisitions or working capital needs.

The TIM Group also faces risks that it may be unable to refinance some or all of its borrowings on
similar terms to its existing debt, on terms that it deems appropriate or at all. The TIM Group’s ability
to refinance its borrowings or to undertake additional borrowings in the future may be affected by a
number of factors, including its operating and financial performance, as well as broader market and
macroeconomic conditions that are outside its control.

If the TIM Group’s future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay
its obligations as they mature or to fund its liquidity needs, it may be forced to:

- reduce or delay certain business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets or equity;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital;

- forgo strategic opportunities, such as acquisitions of other businesses; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The Issuer cannot assure that would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any refinancing of its debt could be at higher interest rates
and may require the TIM Group to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict
the TIM Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The type, timing and terms of
any future financing will depend on the TIM Group’s cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the
financial markets. In addition, the terms of the Notes and any future debt may limit the Issuer’s ability
to pursue any of these measures.

If the TIM Group is unable to access alternative financing, it may not be able to satisfy its debt
obligations, including under the Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreements or
instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, may
become payable on demand, and the Issuer may not have sufficient funds to repay all its debts, including
the Notes.


-----

A significant change in finance costs, whether due to higher levels of borrowing or an increase in
interest payable on future borrowings, or an inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all
may have a material adverse effect on the TIM Group’s business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

**_The Issuer may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase or redeem the Notes upon a_**
**_Change of Control or a Network Event and the occurrence of certain important corporate or other_**
**_events will not constitute a Change of Control or a Network Event._**

The Conditions of the Further Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a Change
of Control or a Network Event in relation to the Issuer. Upon the occurrence of an event constituting a
Change of Control or Network Event under the Conditions of the Further Notes, each Noteholder shall
have the option to require the Issuer to redeem (or, at the Issuer’s option, to purchase) the Notes held
by it (in whole but not in part) on the date which is seven days after the expiration of the Put Period (as
defined in Condition 6.5 (Redemption at the Option of the Holders on the Occurrence of a Change of
_Control and Network Event) at_ 101% of their principal amount together with interest accrued to (but
excluding) the date of redemption.

The source of funds for any redemption or, as appropriate, repurchase of the Notes or repayment of any
other debt required as a result of any such event would be available cash or cash generated from
operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds
provided by the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such
events to make any required redemption or, as appropriate, repurchases of the Notes tendered, and the
Issuer may not be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the required redemption or, as
appropriate, repurchases of the Notes tendered. The inability to redeem or, as appropriate, purchase the
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Network Event would constitute an Event of
Default under the Conditions of the Further Notes, which could trigger a cross-default under other
indebtedness of the TIM Group.

The Issuer’s failure to repay any outstanding amounts under any other indebtedness of the TIM Group
upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Network Event included in the terms of such other
indebtedness would constitute an event of default thereunder, which could, in turn, trigger a crossdefault under the Conditions of the Further Notes. In addition, the TIM Group’s other indebtedness may
contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to certain events or transactions that could
constitute a Change of Control or a Network Event under the terms of the Conditions of the Further
Notes.

The Change of Control provision and the Network Event provision contained in the Conditions of the
Further Notes may not necessarily afford investors protection in the event of certain important corporate
or other events that might adversely affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganisations,
restructurings, mergers, de-mergers, spin-offs, asset dispositions, change a majority of the board of
directors, recapitalization or other similar transactions) because such corporate or other events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change
of Control or, as appropriate result in a Network Event, in each case as defined in the Conditions of the
Further Notes. Except as described in Condition 6.5 (Redemption at the Option of the Holders on the
_Occurrence of a Change of Control and Network Event), the Conditions of the Further Notes will not_
contain provisions that require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganisation, restructuring, merger, de-merger, spin-off, asset disposition, change a majority of the
board of directors, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Network Event” contained in the Conditions of the Further Notes includes a
disposition of all or a substantial portion (constituting more than one-half in quantitative terms) of the
properties or assets comprised in the Network to a Person or Persons which are not a Subsidiary or, as
applicable, Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the


-----

phrase “a substantial portion”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction or transactions would involve a disposition of all or a substantial portion
(constituting more than one-half in quantitative terms)” of the properties or assets comprised in the
Network. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Network Event has occurred and whether a
holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to redeem or make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Conditions of the Further Notes and certain of the TIM Group’s other_**
**_outstanding debt agreements will limit its ability to take certain actions, which may limit the TIM_**
**_Group’s ability to finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities_**
**_and activities._**

The Conditions of the Further Notes and other outstanding debt agreements limit the TIM Group’s
flexibility to operate its business.

In addition, credit facilities of the TIM Group provide for various customary representations and
undertakings as well as affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including relating to acquisitions,
disposals and mergers, which restrict certain aspects of the TIM Group’s business, as well as events of
default provisions. If the Issuer and its Subsidiaries fail to comply with any of these representations,
undertakings, or covenants and are unable to remedy (if applicable) such failure or fail to obtain a waiver
or consent, a default could result under such credit facilities, which could result in termination rights,
acceleration rights, draw stops or increases in interest rates or fees in such credit facilities. In these
circumstances, the Issuer’s assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full the defaulted debt
under such credit facilities or other debt instruments. If such debt was accelerated and the Issuer’s
financial resources were insufficient to discharge its obligations under such agreement, the Issuer could
be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

Moreover, certain credit facilities of the Issuer include, and in the future might include, certain events
of default (such as breaches of representations, warranties and undertakings and if the Issuer or certain
of its subsidiaries fail to make payment when due on certain other debt) that are different from the
events of default set forth in the Conditions of the Further Notes. If an event of default occurs under the
Notes or any of the TIM Group’s other debt instruments and is not cured or waived, the holders of the
defaulted debt could terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding debt, together with
accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the
Issuer’s debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default
provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand as a result of an event of default
under such debt instruments. In these circumstances, the Issuer’s assets and cash flow may not be
sufficient to repay in full the defaulted debt and its other debt, including the Notes then outstanding. If
some or all of these instruments were accelerated, the Issuer could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation, and it may not be able to repay its obligations under the Notes in such an event.

Any future debt may include similar or other restrictive terms. These restrictions could materially and
adversely affect the TIM Group’s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or to engage
in other business activities or consummate transactions that may be in its best interests.

**_The Notes contain limited provisions governing the TIM Group’s operations and the Issuer’s ability_**
**_to merge, effect asset sales or otherwise effect significant transactions that may have a material and_**
**_adverse effect on the Notes and the holders thereof._**

The Conditions of the Further Notes contain limited provisions governing the TIM Group’s operations
and the Issuer’s ability to enter into a merger, asset sale or other significant transaction that could
materially alter its existence, jurisdiction of organisation or regulatory regime and/or its composition
and its business, such as Condition 3.2 (Mergers and Similar Events). In the event the TIM Group was
to enter into such a transaction, Noteholders could be materially and adversely affected.


-----

**_The Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the TIM_**
**_Group’s Subsidiaries._**

The Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Any claim by the Issuer or any
of its creditors, including the holders of the Notes, against any Subsidiaries will be structurally
subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries. The Conditions of the Further Notes do not limit the transfer
of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganisation of any of its Subsidiaries, creditors of
such Subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment in full from their respective assets before the
Issuer is entitled to receive any distribution from such assets as equity holders. Except to the extent that
the Issuer may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against a Subsidiary, claims of creditors of
such Subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that Subsidiary over the
claims of the Issuer as equity holder, and there is no assurance that the claims (if any) of the Issuer as a
creditor against such Subsidiary may not be reduced, limited or extinguished as a result of applicable
insolvency rules (such as the doctrine of equitable subordination or the rules regarding the potential
avoidance of transactions concluded with related persons within a certain hardening period).
Subsidiaries are also subject to liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business (such as trade payables), which liabilities are also effectively senior to the
Notes.

**_Claims of secured creditors of the Issuer, if any, will have priority with respect to their collateral over_**
**_the claims of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the_**
**_assets securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes are not secured by any of the Issuer’s assets. As a result, claims of secured creditors of the
Issuer, if any, will have priority with respect to the assets securing their indebtedness over the claims
of holders of the Notes. As such, the Notes are effectively subordinated to any existing and future
secured indebtedness and other secured obligations of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness or other obligations (except to the extent such assets in the future also secure
the Notes on an equal and rateable basis or priority basis). Although the Conditions of the Further Notes
limit the incurrence of secured indebtedness, such limitations are subject to a number of significant
exceptions.

In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganisation, administration or
other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Issuer at a time when it has secured obligations,
holders of secured indebtedness will have priority claims to the assets of the Issuer that constitute their
collateral (other than to the extent such assets in the future also secure the Notes on an equal and rateable
basis or priority basis). The holders of the Notes will participate rateably with all holders of the
unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer, and potentially with all their other respective general creditors,
based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the Issuer.
The claims of holders of the Notes and other unsecured creditors will also depend on whether there is
any value left in the bankruptcy estate besides any secured assets. If any of the secured indebtedness of
the Issuer becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed against the operating assets that secure such
indebtedness, their assets remaining after repayment of that secured indebtedness may not be sufficient
to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less,
rateably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer.


-----

**_The Issuer is incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favourable to holders_**
**_of the Notes as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organised and is likely to have its centre of main interests under the laws of Italy. The
insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favourable to Noteholders’ interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which Noteholders may be familiar, including in respect of creditors’
reorganisation, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit Noteholders’ ability to recover payments due on the Notes
to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. In the event that the Issuer
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such
proceedings. In particular, the insolvency and other laws of Italy may be materially different from, or
in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to
void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition
interest and the duration of the proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect Noteholders’
ability to enforce Noteholders’ rights in Italy and limit any amounts that Noteholders’ may receive.

In addition, Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and
insolvency code – introduced by virtue of, among others, Legislative Decree No. 14 of 12 January 2019
implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated 19 October 2017 (as subsequently
amended and supplemented, the “Italian Insolvency Code”, also known as Code of Business Crisis and
Insolvency) – being a comprehensive and in material respects innovative legal framework regulating,
among others, insolvency matters. Other than for minor changes in certain provisions of the Italian Civil
Code, which already entered into force on 16 March 2019, the Italian Insolvency Code came into force
starting from 15 July 2022. The previous Italian Bankruptcy Law continues to apply to filings for
declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and
filings seeking the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or
the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), in each case filed or
pending before 15 July 2022. As at the date hereof, the vast majority of the provisions of the Italian
Insolvency Code are untested in Italian courts and there is no guidance or case law available yet on its
application. Considering the sweeping nature of this reform and the absence of judicial guidance, the
impact cannot be predicted or fully assessed as of the date of this Information Memorandum.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

The Original Notes are rated B1, LGD4 - 51% by Moody’s, B+ and a recovery rating of 3(50%) by
S&P and BB- and a recovery rating of RR4 by Fitch and the Further Notes are also expected to be rated
B1, LGD4 - 51% by Moody’s, B+ and a recovery rating of 3(50%) by S&P and BB- and a recovery
rating of RR4 by Fitch. Each of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch is established in the European Union and is
registered under the CRA Regulation as set out in the list of registered credit rating agencies published
by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website (at
_https://www.esma.europa.eu/supervision/credit-rating-agencies/risk) in accordance with the CRA_
Regulation. Such ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market,
additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or
withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.

Any adverse change in the credit ratings assigned to us and/or to the Notes may have a negative impact
on the market value of the Notes and availability of future financing. Such change may, among other
factors, be due to a change in the methodology applied by a rating agency to the rating of securities with
similar structures to the Notes, as opposed to any revaluation of the Issuer’s or the TIM Group’s
financial strength or other factors such as conditions affecting the TIM Group’s industry generally.


-----

No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that
a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgement
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit
rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost
and terms and conditions of the Issuer’s or the TIM Group’s financings and could adversely affect the
value and trading of the Notes.

**_Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes._**

In the event that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts as provided or referred
to in Condition 7 (Taxation) either:

(a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Relevant
Jurisdiction (as defined in Condition 7 (Taxation)) or any change in the application or official
interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on
or after 25 January 2023 in relation to the Notes and such obligation cannot be avoided by the
Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it; or

(b) where a Person into which the Issuer is merged or to whom it has conveyed, transferred or
leased all or substantially all of its assets is required to pay additional amounts, unless the sole
purpose of such a merger would be to permit the Issuer to redeem the Notes,

the Issuer may pursuant to Condition 6.2 (Redemption for Taxation Reasons) redeem the Notes in
whole, but not in part.

In addition, pursuant to Condition 6.3 (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Make-Whole Call)), the
Issuer may choose to redeem the Notes at make-whole at times when prevailing interest rates may be
relatively low.

The Issuer may also redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes under Condition 6.4 (Redemption at
_the Option of the Issuer (Issuer Maturity Par Call)) in the circumstances specified therein._

The Issuer may also, on any one or more occasions, redeem up to 40 per cent. of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes originally issued at a redemption price equal to 106.875 per cent. of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest on the relevant Interest Payment Date), with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering as
further described in Condition 6.6 (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Equity Offering)).

If the Issuer calls and redeems the Notes in the circumstances mentioned above, the Noteholders may
suffer a lower than expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in
comparable securities offering a yield as high as that of the Notes. Prospective investors should consider
reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.

**_Some of the TIM Group’s indebtedness bears interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_thereby increasing costs and reducing cash flow, and that may be impacted by applicable law and_**
**_regulation._**

A portion of the TIM Group’s outstanding borrowings bear interest at floating rates, exposing the TIM
Group to the fluctuations of variable interest rates based on benchmark rates such as the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). Increases in the applicable benchmark rates used in the calculation of
interest on these borrowings would result in higher interest expenses to service these debt levels in the
future. An increase in variable and/or fixed interest rates may result in the TIM Group incurring interest
expense and cash outflows in relation to these debt instruments at higher levels than anticipated, thereby


-----

reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering the TIM Group’s ability to make
payments on the Notes. These rates could increase significantly and for a variety of reasons, including
due to changes in the monetary and interest rate policies of central banks, as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in the European Union and globally. While the TIM Group may from time to time
hedge a portion of its interest rate exposure, it is under no obligation to do so and any hedging activity
in respect of the TIM Group’s variable-rate debt may be discontinued at any time. Further, there can be
no assurance that, if the TIM Group wishes to hedge its interest rate exposure, such hedging
arrangements will be available to the TIM Group on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, another measure of interbank lending rates, regulators
and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union have conducted
investigations into whether banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily
EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate
EURIBOR and LIBOR.

Various interest rate benchmarks (including EURIBOR) are the subject of recent national and
international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective,
including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) and the cessation of the
publication of Sterling LIBOR rates and certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates after 31 December
2021, while others are still to be implemented.

These reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR, the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate
(SONIA), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or other such benchmarks to disappear
entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise),
create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain
benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors
should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant
interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level
of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile
than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on the TIM Group’s ability to service
debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR, SONIA, or SOFR (or any of
their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the TIM Group’s
finance documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have
not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such
obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant
documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the
provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market
circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).

**_The Conditions of the Further Notes contain provisions which may permit their modification without_**
**_the consent of all investors and confer significant discretion on the Trustee which may be exercised_**
**_without the consent of the Noteholders and without regard to the individual interests of particular_**
**_Noteholders._**

The Conditions of the Further Notes contain provisions for convening meetings of Noteholders to
consider and vote upon matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined
majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant
meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.

The Conditions of the Further Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of
Noteholders and without regard to the interests of particular Noteholders, agree to (i) any modification
of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of the
Notes or (ii) determine without the consent of the Noteholders that any Event of Default or potential
Event of Default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution of another company as principal


-----

debtor under any Notes in place of the Issuer, in the circumstances described in Conditions 13
(Substitution) and 14.2 (Waiver, Authorisation, Determination and Exercise by the Trustee of
_Discretions Etc.)._

**_The value of the Notes could be adversely affected by a change in English or Italian law or_**
**_administrative practice._**

The Conditions of the Further Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this Information
Memorandum. In addition, Condition 14.1 (Meetings of Noteholders) and Schedule 3 (Provisions for
_Meetings of Noteholders) of the Supplemental Trust Deed are subject to compliance with Italian law._
No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English or
Italian law or administrative practice after the date of this Information Memorandum and any such
change could materially adversely impact the value of any Notes affected by it. See also “—
_Noteholders’ meeting provisions may change by operation of law or because of changes in the Issuer’s_
_circumstances” below._

**_Decisions at Noteholders’ meetings bind all Noteholders._**

The Conditions of the Further Notes (at Condition 14.1 (Meetings of Noteholders)) and the Trust Deed
(at Schedule 3 (Provisions for Meetings of Noteholders) contain provisions for calling meetings of
Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally, including modifications to the terms
and conditions relating to the Notes and the waiver of rights that might otherwise be exercisable against
the Issuer. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders
who did not attend or were not represented at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a
manner contrary to the majority. Any such modifications to the Notes may have an adverse impact on
Noteholders’ rights and on the market value of the Notes. See also “— Noteholders’ meeting provisions
_may change by operation of law or because of changes in the Issuer’s circumstances” below._

**_Noteholders’ meeting provisions may change by operation of law or because of changes in the_**
**_Issuer’s circumstances._**

As mentioned in “— The value of the Notes could be adversely affected by a change in English or
_Italian law or administrative practice” above, the provisions relating to Noteholders’ meetings_
(including quorums and voting majorities) are subject to compliance with certain mandatory provisions
of Italian law, which may change during the life of the Notes. In addition, as currently drafted, the rules
concerning Noteholders’ meetings are intended to follow mandatory provisions of Italian law that apply
to Noteholders’ meetings where the issuer is an Italian listed company. Furthermore, certain
Noteholders’ meeting provisions could change as a result of amendments to the Issuer’s By-laws.

Accordingly, Noteholders should not assume that the provisions relating to Noteholders’ meetings
contained in the Trust Deed and summarised in the Conditions of the Further Notes will correctly reflect
mandatory provisions of Italian law applicable to Noteholders’ meetings at any future date during the
life of the Notes.

**_Investors who hold less than the minimum specified denomination may be unable to sell their Notes_**
**_and may be adversely affected if definitive Notes are subsequently required to be issued_**

The Notes have denominations consisting of the minimum specified denomination of €100,000 plus
one or more higher integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof up to and including €199,000 and as
such it is possible that such Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of the minimum specified
denomination that are not integral multiples of such minimum specified denomination. In such a case,
a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum
specified denomination in his account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the
remainder of such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of the


-----

minimum specified denomination such that its holding amounts to a specified denomination. Further, a
holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum
specified denomination in his account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not
receive a definitive Note in respect of such holding (should definitive Notes be printed) and would need
to purchase a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of the minimum specified denomination such
that its holding amounts to a specified denomination.

If such Notes in definitive form are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Notes which have a
denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum specified denomination may be illiquid
and difficult to trade.

**_Payments in respect of the Notes may in certain circumstances be made subject to withholding or_**
**_deduction of tax for which holders may not receive additional amounts._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is an Italian resident for tax purposes and therefore
payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes,
will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments made by the Issuer or on its behalf in
respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless
the withholding or deduction is required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the
Issuer will pay such additional amounts that may result in the holders of the Notes receiving such
amounts that they would have received in regards to such Notes had no such withholding or deduction
been required.

The Issuer is not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in certain circumstances,
including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239. In those
circumstances, investors will receive the proceeds of their investment in the Notes, net of applicable
withholding or deductions.

In particular, holders of Notes that are not residents in White List countries, holders who are residents
in White List countries that do not properly and promptly satisfy the required conditions and procedures
set forth by Decree No. 239 (and by the relevant application rules to benefit from exemption from Italian
taxation), and certain categories of holders of the Notes who are residents in Italy, will therefore only
receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes and will not be paid any additional amounts to
compensate them for the withholding or deduction.

Although the Issuer believes that, under current law, Italian withholding tax or substitute tax will not
be imposed under Decree No. 239 where the Notes are issued by a company listed on a regulated market
or multilateral trading facility of an European Union or European Economic Area country and the holder
of Notes is a resident for tax purposes in a White List country and such holder promptly and properly
complies with certain certification and procedural requirements set forth by Decree No. 239 by the
relevant application rules, there is no assurance that this will be the case should there be a change in
applicable law or relevant procedures. See “Taxation”. Moreover, holders of the Notes should note that
they will bear the risk of any change in the White List.

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements provided by Decree No. 239 will be met_**
**_by the relevant foreign intermediaries._**

The exemption from withholding tax in principle granted to holders of the Notes - who are the beneficial
owners of the Notes (or, if the holders are institutional investors not subject to tax, even if they are not
the beneficial owners of the Notes) and are resident in countries included in the White List - applies if
certain procedural requirements are met. No assurance can be given that all non-Italian resident
investors will be eligible for the withholding tax exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary
fails to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities under the procedures for
applying the exemption regime. Should the procedural requirements not be met, Italian income


-----

withholding tax or substitute tax may apply on the payments made on the Notes to foreign investors
resident in countries included on the White List. In such event, the Issuer will not be required to pay
any additional amounts with respect to such withholding tax or substitutive tax.

**Risks relating to the market generally**

Set out below is a brief description of the principal market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk and credit risk:

**_There is no established trading market for the Further Notes and no assurance that the holders of_**
**_the Notes will be able to sell them._**

The Further Notes are new securities for which there is currently no established market. The Issuer has
made an application to list the Further Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admit them to trading on the professional segment of its Euro MTF Market thereof, but cannot
guarantee the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Further Notes, the ability of the holders
of the Further Notes to sell such Further Notes or the price at which they may be able to sell such Further
Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Further Notes depend on many factors, including,
among other things, prevailing interest rates, results of operations, the market for similar securities and
general economic conditions.

In addition, changes in the overall market for non-investment grade securities and changes in the
Issuer’s financial performance in the markets in which it operates may adversely affect the liquidity of
any trading market in the Further Notes that does develop and any market price quoted for the Further
Notes. As a result, the Issuer cannot ensure that an active trading market will actually develop for the
Further Notes or that, if developed, such market will be maintained.

Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Further Notes have been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Further
Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading
of the Further Notes independent of the Issuer’s or the TIM Group’s financial performance and
prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Further Notes.

Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Further Notes easily or at prices that will provide them
with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. In addition,
liquidity may be limited if the Issuer makes large allocations to a limited number of investors.

Additionally, the Further Notes will have different international securities identification numbers and
common codes (as applicable) from, and will not trade fungibly with, the corresponding Original Notes
until the Exchange Date. The Further Notes have different international securities identification
numbers and common codes (as applicable), and will not trade fungibly with, the Original Notes during
the period prior to and including the 40[th] day following the Further Notes Issue Date. Because the
Further Notes will initially not be fungible with the Original Notes, a market for trading in the Further
Notes may not develop, or may not be liquid, which may impact the tradability and price of the Further
Notes. After the 40[th] day following the Further Notes Issue Date, certain selling restrictions with respect
to the Further Notes will terminate and the Further Notes will become fully fungible with, and have the
same international securities identification numbers and common codes (as applicable) as the Original
Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer intends to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to have them admitted to trading on the professional segment of the Euro MTF Market
and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure prospective


-----

investors that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing of the
Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly onerous to make
or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized listing exchange for non-investment grade
issuers, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance
is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for non-investment grade issuers in accordance
with the Conditions of the Further Notes, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes
from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another stock exchange in accordance
with the Conditions of the Notes may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the
Notes in the secondary market.

**_Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments._**

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or
review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to
determine whether and to what extent (a) the Notes are legal investments for it, (b) the Notes can be
used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (c) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge
of any Notes.

Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the
appropriate treatment of the Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

_Introduction_

The 2022-2024 Industrial Plan announced in March 2022 launched a Group transformation aiming to
overcome the vertically integrated model, based on four separate entities with different industrial and
economic focuses (NetCo, TIM Consumer, TIM Enterprise and TIM Brasil). These entities cannot
currently be considered an “operating segment” in accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating segments,
insofar as on the one hand, the new entities are still in an analytical design phase and do not, therefore,
have analytical economic-financial information available and, on the other, the allocation of resources
to each new entity and assessment of the economic and financial performance on both the basis of the
historic representation of the Business Units and, insofar as available, the new entities being created is
ongoing by TIM’s management.

The 2023-2025 Industrial Plan announced in February 2023 continues the transformation process
started with the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan. In particular, thanks to the better-than-expected results
recorded in 2022, the plan envisages further acceleration of the implementation of the strategy initially
provided for in the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan at Group level, including through new strategies based
on the improved corporate configuration made up of the four separate entities with different industrial
and economic focuses that have been identified in the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan (i.e. NetCo, TIM
Consumer, TIM Enterprise, and TIM Brasil).

The TIM Group Business Units described below (Domestic Business Unit, Brasil Business Unit and
Other Operations Business Unit) are presented in line with the 2022 TIM Annual Report. As such, in
this section, the Group’s telecommunications business described below is presented geographically (i.e.
Domestic and Brazil) and not in terms of the new organisational model to be implemented as envisaged
under the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan. For further information on how the Group will be organised
following implementation of the reorganisation envisaged by the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan, please see
_“—The 2022-2024 Industrial Plan: Reorganisation”, “—The 2023-2025 Industrial Plan” below and_
the section “Summary—Overview—TIM’s Strategy” above.

**Domestic commercial developments**

**Consumer**

In 2022, TIM continued its development of the network and new generation services, launching, after
a one-year trial period, as the first operator in Italy to do so and among the first in Europe, a commercial
service that takes FTTH fibre connections, offering high performance of up to 10 Gigabits per second,
to homes, thanks to XGS-PON technology (10 Gigabit capable Symmetric Passive Optical Network).

The TIM WiFi Power All Inclusive offer yields not only speeds of up to 10 Gigabits but also the very
best technology thanks to the TIM 10Gb modem that assures a powerful, stable, secure connection in
all areas of the home and dedicated assistance for an extremely high-level browsing experience. The
offer flanks the other offers of the new TIM WiFi Power portfolio, Smart and Top with speeds of 2.5
Gigabit in download, launched in June.

TIM has continued to develop the fixed UBB market, also with FWA technology, in a manner that
complements FTTx technologies to cover the areas not previously serviced. In 2022, the FWA offer
was updated with strengthened connection performance and speeds of up to 100 Mbps in download and
up to 50 Mbps in upload and with the launch of a new subscription offer called TIM WiFi Power FWA.
The FWA offer is also available as pay-as-you-go, with speeds of up to 40 Mbps.

Throughout 2022, TIM continued to support the adoption of new fibre technology with offers for ADSL
customers already covered by the fibre-to-the-cabinet (“FTTCab”) and FTTH service to upgrade to the
new technology without additional costs and leveraging on new offer content different to that of the
market and, in particular, on the TIM Per TE Casa offer, dedicated to the customer base.

For Mobile, in 2022 TIM continued to support the development of UBB, consolidating 4G and
developing 5G in more than 350 cities with speeds of up to 2 Gigabits per second. In 2022, TIM also
completed the switch off of the 3G network, making it possible to focus on investments in 4G and 5G
technologies, which are more energy efficient and higher performing in terms of the quality of service
offered to its customers.

Technological leadership means a competitive edge for TIM, which is fundamental for making it mark
in a highly competitive market. Exploiting the distinctive quality of the network, TIM has been able to
continue its “value” strategy, maintaining a premium position on the market, as borne out by the launch
of the new TIM 5G Power offer.

TIM’s smartphone portfolio has also focused on 5G, further increasing the incidence of 5G products
and extending 5G to include medium and medium-low range products with prices to the public of less
than 200 euros. Thanks to the partnership between TIM and Santander Consumer Bank S.p.A. for the
offer of a consumer credit platform dedicated to TIM’s customers (through the Joint Venture TIMFin),
TIM has successfully optimized its management of working capital and improved its credit risk
management. TIM Mobile customers can buy products with payments by instalments simply by
activating a loan with TIMFin, as well as being able to access personalized, transparent financial and
insurance solutions.


-----

The TIM distribution network, which has an agreement with TIMFin, includes around 3 thousand
dealers and more than 5 thousand points of sale (PoS) and offers capillary coverage across the country.
It is mainly involved in financing smartphones, which customers pay for by instalments and in offering
insurance products that are ancillary to the sale of smartphones.

The financing process is completely digital, through the use of OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
tools, scoring algorithms to automatically assess customers, digital signature, OTP (One-TimePassword) to formalize contracts electronically and completely paperless documentation, so as to assure
a quicker response to applications for financing and the best customer experience possible. The IT
solution is entered into the information system that TIM makes available to its distribution network.

The main data of TIMFin are the following:

- an approximate total of 369 thousand loans were granted in 2022 for the purchase of devices,
worth an equivalent of approximately 243 million euros (+41% on 2021);

- a total of 360 thousand factoring contracts were acquired in 2022, worth an equivalent of
approximately 82 million euros (-28% on 2021);

- a total of 1,269 personal loans were granted in 2022, worth an equivalent of approximately 13
million euros.

Instead, as regards insurance distribution, together with the consolidation of “TIMFin Assicura Prestito”
and “TIMFin Assicura Spesa,” “TIMFin Assicura Smartphone,” an ancillary insurance coverage to the
sale of smartphones, which covers the repair or replacement of the smartphone in case of accidental
damage and/or theft, was launched since March 2022 in cooperation with Assurant. In 2022, a total of
11,955 policies were placed for an equivalent value of approximately 3.4 million euros in premiums
collected.

Moreover, in 2022 TIM continued to support the optimization and growth of the convergent customer
with cross offers and benefits for TIM’s fixed and/or mobile customers, both through the TIM Unica
offer and with targeted convergent promotions.

With TIM Unica, the advantages of being a TIM customer, both on fixed and on mobile, are
strengthened: unlimited gigabytes gifted each month to the family, discounts on mobile offers of the
TIM 5G POWER portfolio and on TV offers (e.g. TimVision promotion with Disney+, offering 3
months free), Local promotion for pushing fibre in critical areas (e.g. the Milan promotion). In addition,
May 2022 saw the launch of the fixed and mobile promotion to increase new accesses.

Within the Consumer offers for the family segment, in June 2022, TIM WiFi Power TV was launched,
the range of offers whereby fibre is commercially combined with other packages of TimVision content,
offered up in special promotions. Again in June 2022, the convergent TIM WiFi +5G Power offer was
launched, for families wanting to browse without limits and with ultra-fast fibre and TIM’s 5G.

Additional offers were launched during the year for under-30s, with the TIM WiFi Special Young offer
and low-income families, with the _Bonus Famiglia offer (for families with ISEE (Indicatore della_
_Situazione Economica Equivalente) income of less than €20,000), in view of the closure of the_
government initiative linked to the vouchers.

In addition, in order to guarantee a distinctive position, TIM has continued to promote and improve its
portfolio of digital services, such as: TIM PEC, SPID, Cloud Service in partnership with Google, TIM
One Number, Smart mobility and TIM MyBroker. In addition, in December 2022, TIM launched the
new WiFi calling service that makes it possible to talk using a smartphone where there is a lack of
mobile coverage, using TIM’s WiFi connection.


-----

**Small and Medium Business Segment**

In 2022, TIM strengthened the positioning based on “connection strength” for the Small and Medium
Business Segment too, launching 10 Gbps fibre, the first to do so in the segment in Italy, also in versions
with a guaranteed minimum bandwidth, for companies with more sophisticated connectivity needs, for
which the new fixed wireless access (FWA) connectivity offer has also been launched in 5G technology
in the 26 GHz bandwidth (mmWave).

The fixed portfolio has also been revised, optimizing the premium quality of TIM services, both in
terms of assistance (problem solving in 1 day) and performance (FTTH 2.5G and 10G) and transparency
of tariffs (zero restrictions) and voucher offers were launched, dedicated to small and medium
enterprises: both new customers and those already in the customer base. The offers have been
constructed to maximize the target for disseminating fibre in Italy, thanks to business connectivity
vouchers, available from March 2022, with an amount that varies from 300 euros to 2,500 euros.

On mobile, the new 5G Power portfolio has been launched, with the aim of better conveying the quality
of the network and increasing the value of acquisitions, exploiting a range of appealing contents that
can satisfy the new demands of business customers in an increasingly competitive market.

Reinforcement of commercial oversight of the most valuable customers with an increase in the number
of customers managed in the caring portfolio and development of a dedicated caring model.

Consolidation of the stores channel as a commercial touch point for VAT-registered small traders.

Development of specific content for the TIM business digital channel in order to increase the
acquisitions of solutions for fixed, mobile and ICT offer for the Soho market. Development of on-line
services dedicated to customers on apps and the web.

**Sustainability**

TIM is committed to limiting its environmental impact with various initiatives, such as the sale of
regenerated smartphones, exclusively Class A +, to guarantee the end customer top quality (only
original spare parts) but minimizing accessories and packaging materials, as well as continuing to
market “half card” SIMs (half the normal SIM card) and using recycled plastic for card carriers, thereby
saving approximately 14 tons of plastic per year.

The “TIM Next” loyalty program for the Consumer segment continues, offering customers the chance
to replace their smartphones with a new model, at the same time encouraging the collection and
recycling of used smartphones, which are recycled.

On the SMB market, the Group continues to sell refurbished smartphones to satisfy the demands of
business customers looking for sustainable purchases without renouncing performance and quality. The
refurbished products have the highest level of refurbishing (first class), a 24-month warranty and a
bundle pack with all-risk insurance protection included in the purchase price.

One of the pillars of the TIM strategy is the optimization of the customer base, applying a data driven
logic, with the target of revenue maximization. To this end, a transformation project is in progress for
the construction of a fully-automated CVM machine based on machine learning algorithms and artificial
intelligence to optimize investments and increase the effectiveness of the commercial actions.

**Consumer**

In 2022, CVM actions focused in particular on convergence and cross selling:


-----

- launch of cross-selling campaigns on the TIM Mobile Only customer base with a focus on TIM
Unica to increase penetration of the convergent customer base and churn prevention plans with
targeted offers on the customer mobile line: 1.5 million TIM Unica customers, +33% compared
to 31 December 2021;

- NMP loyalty campaigns intended for specific fixed only customer targets with the aim of
decreasing churn;

- Increase in the CB FTTH action plan dedicated to the technological upgrade of the customer
base, with customized campaigns according to the value and needs of the customer.

**Small and Medium Business Segment**

The 2022 actions for the small and medium-sized enterprises have been carried out on micro clusters
defined according to the analysis of the needs of customers through the cross-matching of internal data
and external databases and focused on:

- government push vouchers to facilitate the technological upgrade towards TIM’s fibre in
particular towards the FTTH.

- Upselling of payment options with additional gigabytes on mobile.

- Cross selling of fixed and mobile for a push on convergence.

- Push on It and VoIP services differentiated by product category segment and needs.

- Prevention of churn of higher value customers at risk, identified with the enrichment of data
driven predictions.

The CVM platform has been strengthened to increase the effectiveness of campaigns: the integration
process with all channels has been completed in particular with the two channels (agencies and stores)
that have significantly increased actions on the CB. Clustering instruments have been refined to improve
control of the ARPU and optimize the economic results of the campaigns. New campaign monitoring
instruments have been developed to facilitate the constant fine-tuning of selling and clusters.

**Consumer**

In 2022 too, a key role in support of TIM’s positioning is played by the important drive on contents
with the consolidation of the partnerships with Disney+ and Netflix for entertainment and with DAZN
and Infinity+ for Football and Sports, above all Serie A TIM and UEFA Champions League.

TimVision is today the main aggregator of sports and entertainment content with the most complete
and competitive offer on the Italian television market, also thanks to its partnerships with the main
operators of the national and international market.

In order to strengthen the completeness of the commercial proposal of TimVision, in August 2022,
another important partnership was launched with Amazon, which made it possible for customers to add
Amazon Prime to the TimVision offer (an add-on in exchange for payment).

And again, from the perspective of the evolution of TimVision, the start in November 2022 of the
migration of the TimVision technology platform towards My canal should be considered, which aims
to ensure, in line with European best practices, the best experience of use and vision of contents for the
end customer.


-----

**Small and Medium Business**

On ICT, TIM continued to work on the consolidation of the four areas that cover the segment’s main
needs, starting from information security, through to collaboration, IOT and the cloud, intended as
computing capacity as well as storage, data backup and the adoption of SaaS solutions. This has been
achieved by streamlining sales processes and expanding the portfolio with solutions ever more tailored
to the needs of SMEs.

Expansion of the ICT offer through advanced connectivity solutions (VoIP) and partnerships with major
market players.

(b) **Brasil Business Unit (TIM Brasil Group)**

The Brasil Business Unit provides mobile services using universal mobile telecommunications system
(“UMTS”), global system mobile (“GSM”) and long-term evolution (“LTE”) technologies. Moreover,
the TIM Brasil group offers fibre optic data transmission using full IP technology, such as dense

**Brasil Commercial developments**

2022 was marked by the success of the 5G launch and TIM has confirmed its leadership in coverage
with the new technology. The integration of Oi, with the completion of the migration of customers and
the integration of the network, is also an important result. Consequently, TIM Brasil was able to sustain
a solid growth rate in mobile revenues despite the macroeconomic challenges. As regards fixed
solutions, TIM Brasil is focusing on a massive migration of customers from FTTC to FTTH to maximize
customer experience and profitability. Additionally, its non-core initiatives, both in IoT and digital
services, grew in terms of number of partnerships and contribution to its results.

- **Marketing and brand positioning: TIM Brasil has strengthened the credibility of its brand,**
supporting the social development and digitization of Brazil, while at the same time
strengthening the specificity of the network quality. It has used the results in developing the
network - TIM was the first operator to cover 100% of the country’s municipalities and has
become leader in 5G coverage - as essential elements of its communication to customers and
stakeholders in general. TIM has also played a cutting-edge role in innovation in recent years
and will continue to guide innovation through contents and partnerships, like those with Deezer
and Amazon Prime Video and the sponsorship of Rock in Rio, the world’s largest music
festival, to strengthen the tie of its brand with music and entertainment. TIM Brasil has also
developed many initiatives to solidify its institutional positioning, including the ESG agenda in
the company strategy.

- **Mobile offers: to accelerate growth beyond connectivity, TIM Brasil is continuing scale up**
partnerships leveraging its user base and key assets to expand new businesses. TIM Brasil has
developed different offers for all segments. TIM Brasil has the best prepaid offer of Brazil,
which through the musical streaming service DeezerGo and Amazon Prime Video, combines

music and video content. In the post-paid segment, TIM Brasil has continued to work on the
consolidation of its position as innovators and was the first telecommunication in Brazil to
launch a free Wi-Fi service during flights for TIM Black customers, thanks to an innovative
partnership with the airlines Gol and LATAM.

- **Customer Experience: TIM Brasil is constantly working to improve its customer experience**
and satisfaction through the use of technology. In this regard, the evolution of AI solutions and
its digital channels are key. In the 2022 Perceived Quality and Satisfaction survey run by Anatel
(National Telecommunication Agency), TIM Brasil remained in first place in the classification
of mobile services and was rewarded with the Reclame Aqui RA 1000 certificate for excellence
in customer service. The quality of its network was also recognized by Ookla Speedtest ranking,
as TIM was appointed the best video and video conference experience while having the highest
4G availability.

- **Sales channels: TIM Brasil maintained its focus on channel productivity, segmentation, and**
quality of sales. During 2021, it remodelled its digital channels while reorganizing its structure
to increase focus on e-commerce and in-app purchases. In 2022, TIM Brasil created a sales app
for independent retailers; through the app, TIM + Vendas, independent retailers, can register
with the app to re-sell SIMs and top-ups of TIM Brasil, thereby generating additional income.

- **Residential market: in 2022, TIM Brasil focused on a massive migration of customers from**
FTTC to FTTH to maximize customer experience and profitability, at the same time also
consolidating the asset-light model to expand its presence through partnerships with neutral
networks like I-Systems.

- **Corporate: TIM Brasil consolidated its “Leaders with Leaders” strategy in agribusiness and**
launched the first IoT marketplace for B2B in Brazil by promoting IoT solutions through
partnerships. In addition, it launched the FCA partnership for connected cars and for industry
and mining, while developing a private LTE solution for business-critical use case
management. In 2022, TIM Brasil pursued new opportunities to become a complete vertical
orchestrator, such as, for example, monitoring and managing company fleets and smart lighting,
meter reading and distribution automation solutions.

(c) **Other Operations Business Unit**

Other operations include the financial companies Telecom Italia Capital S.A. and Telecom Italia
Finance S.A. and other minor companies not strictly related to the TIM Group’s core business.

**The 2022-2024 Industrial Plan: Reorganisation**

The 2022-2024 Industrial Plan launched a reorganisation within the TIM Group aiming to overcome
the vertically integrated model, based on four separate entities with different industrial and economic
focuses (NetCo, TIM Consumer, TIM Enterprise and TIM Brasil). These entities cannot today be
considered an “operating segment” in accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating segments, as discussed above
under “—Business Units—Introduction”.

The financial information of the new entities presented herein has therefore been prepared by TIM’s
management for information and explanatory purposes only; it has not been verified by any independent
third parties and, therefore, should not be considered complete and comprehensive. The accounting and
consolidation principles applied are consistent with those applied for the TIM Group Annual
Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2021, to which reference should be made, except
for the changes to the accounting standards issued by the IASB and adopted as of 1 January 2022.

During the first nine months of 2022, the entities of the Business Units defined by the 2022-2024
Industrial Plan (NetCo, TIM Consumer, TIM Enterprise) achieved the following operative performance
in organic terms[8]:

The Group’s four key businesses (Netco, TIM Enterprise, TIM Consumer, TIM Brasil) are briefly
described below.

- **NetCo: includes the primary and secondary fixed network, as well as the domestic and**
international (Sparkle) wholesale businesses;

- **TIM Enterprise: covers all the fixed and mobile commercial activities in the Consumer and**
Small and Medium Business (SMB) retail market. It also includes the mobile network assets
and service platforms;

- **TIM Consumer: includes all the commercial activities in the Enterprise market, the digital**
companies Noovle, Olivetti and Telsy and the assets relating to the data centers; and

- **TIM Brasil: See above description of the TIM Brasil Business Unit.**

Each entity will be single-minded, with a focused business model, a clear set of leading KPIs, a Capex
allocation tuned to its specific investment horizon and the ability to onboard talents in the new
businesses.

On 9 November 2022, TIM’s Board of Directors approved the process for the set-up of the TIM
Enterprise legal entity, in line with what announced at the Capital Markets Day held on 7 July 2022 by
the TIM management team.

**The 2023-2025 Industrial Plan**

On 14 February 2023 the Board of Directors approved 2023-2025 Industrial Plan which continues the
transformation process started with the 2022-2024 Industrial Plan. Despite a radically different
macroeconomic context compared to last year, the 2023-2025 Industrial Plan is consistent with the
2022-2024 Industrial Plan. In particular, thanks to the better-than-expected results recorded in 2022, the
plan envisages further acceleration at Group level.

The 2023-2025 Industrial Plan envisages the following strategies for the four separate entities in the
new corporate configuration:

- **TIM Enterprise: targets growth above the reference market through increased standardisation**
and industrialisation of offers and the consolidation of a bundled offer for public sector
customers.

- **TIM Consumer: initiatives continue to implement the premium positioning in a volume to**
value strategy, with the aim of differentiating TIM from the competition. TIM Consumer
intends to continue the gradual repricing of the customer base, along with the introduction of
inflation adjustment mechanisms.

- **NetCo: TIM’s strategic priorities are to further roll-out fixed ultra-broadband infrastructure,**
which will be functional to also provide backhauling to the 5G network, and to further
accelerate the migration of lines to FTTH technology. In the mobile segment, the priority is to
maximise 5G coverage, which by 2025 targets reaching 90% of the population.

- **TIM Brasil: the company continues to focus on a value strategy and benefits from additional**
growth impetus from the integration of Oi’s assets, continuing on its targeted outcome to
become the best mobile player in Brazil leveraging on Oi’s integration and 5G technology.

On the same date, for each of the four entities, a summary of the performance parameters has been
given, and more in particular:

- **NetCo: in 2022 recorded total revenues and revenues from services down respectively by 4%**
YoY and 4% YoY. The reduction is mainly due to one-off transactions recorded in the accounts
in the first half of the previous year.

- **TIM Enterprise: in 2022 recorded total revenues and revenues from services up respectively**
by 8% YoY and 11% YoY. The growth above the reference market thanks to the increased
standardisation and industrialisation of offers and the consolidation of a bundled offer for the
public administration.

- **TIM Consumer: in 2022 recorded total revenues and revenues from services down**
respectively by 9% YoY and 7% YoY.


-----

- **TIM Brasil: in 2022 recorded total revenues and revenues from services up respectively by**
19.2% YoY and 19.0% YoY and an EBITDA of +16.4% YoY. Significant growth was also
seen in the fourth quarter of total revenues (+21.4% YoY), service revenues (+20.8% YoY) and
EBITDA (+16.9% YoY) thanks to a solid organic performance and the contribution made to
the Oi assets.

In addition to the above, the 2023-2025 Industrial Plan defines the ESG priorities for all business areas
and operations with the aim of improving the social and environmental impact and, at the same time,
the business results. All this is achieved through the pursuit of efficiency, the use of the circular
economy in processes, innovative and sustainable purchases and the supply of new services for the
public administration and enterprises, driving the digital transition.

**Competition in the domestic market**

**_The market_**

In 2021, the Italian TLC market showed a significant reduction in revenues (-2.8% YoY) for both the
fixed network (-1.3% YoY) and the mobile network (-4.6% YoY)[9].

During the first half of 2022, the reduction was accentuated of revenues (-4.4% YoY) in both market
contexts (fixed network -4.4% YoY, mobile network -3.2% YoY)[10].

After the most acute phases of the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, which struck Italy before the other European
countries, in 2021, the Italian economy recorded strong growth (+6.6% YoY), approaching prepandemic levels. The fourth quarter of 2022 recorded a growth trend of +1.4% (4th quarter 2022 vs 4th
quarter 2021)[11], while the 2022 annual change for 2022 came to +3.7%[12].

The restrictions applied to economic activities and social behaviour, which had sparked significant
phenomena with impacts on the use of ICT services, were progressively attenuated and ultimately
eliminated entirely.

Despite the attenuation of the restrictions, the growth of data traffic per line, which had accelerated in
2020 during the lock-down, continued in 2021 and remained, albeit with somewhat lesser intensity, in
2022 too, for both the fixed network (Jan-Sep: 2020 +40.5% YoY, 2021 +17% YoY, 2022 +6.8% YoY),
and the mobile network (Jan-Sep: 2020 +54.1% YoY, 2021 +34.8% YoY, 2022 +28.0% YoY)[13].

In terms of long-term trends, the development of broadband and ultra-broadband continues to be the
main factor of market evolution. The greater availability of ultra-broadband will increasingly allow
operators to develop convergent offers that combine media & entertainment, IT and digital services
with TLC services. The offer of these services will further increase the adoption of broadband by
customers.

The Italian telecommunications market remains highly competitive, with the greatest impact of market
dynamics on voice and data connectivity services. Furthermore, in the new digital world,
telecommunications operators have to deal with Over The Top - OTT and device manufacturers with
completely different competitive assets and logic. All this is also borne out by the major reduction in
the TLC price index recorded in 2021 (-6% YoY)[14], which remains in 2022 in a context of general

inflation at +9.2% with Communications at +0.8% (general trending consumer price variation index in
February 2023)[15].

The traditional business models of the various market players are, therefore, changing over time to
exploit new opportunities and meet the challenges posed by the new competitors:

- in the media and entertainment sector, due to the growing importance of the Internet as a
complementary distribution platform, in 2021, the Italian television market saw the further
development of video on demand (VOD and SVOD) services, combined with the growing
diffusion of OTT services that include linear video content. The central role played by the
broadband network in these new use modes sees players like the mentioned OTT,
telecommunications operators and consumer electronics producers play an increasingly
important role;

- in the information and communication technology market, although there was overall growth
in both 2021 (+5.3% YoY)[16] and in the first half of 2022 (+3% YoY)[17], the traditional fixedline and mobile TLC component contracted, in favor of IT components related to digital
transformation, especially for large companies, for example with the adoption of cloud
solutions for their technological infrastructures. In this sector, telecommunications operators
have been strengthened, including through partnerships, to take advantage of the growth that,
in the next few years, will be driven by the digitalization of SMEs and the investments of the
NRRP.

With regards to the current positioning of the telecommunications operators in convergent markets,
certain trends are seen, already mentioned above with different levels of evolution:

- the development of new services in the sector of media and entertainment (TV, Music, Gaming)
and new digital services (smart home, digital advertising, mobile payment-digital identity);

- the development of innovative services in the IT market, particularly cloud, IoT and
cybersecurity services.

As regards 5G, after the assignment of frequencies in 2018 and the launch of the service by TIM and
Vodafone in 2019, by Wind Tre, Fastweb and Iliad in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were characterized by the
progressive deployment of the network on the national territory.

**_Competition in fixed telecommunications_**

The fixed-line telecommunications market has continued to see a downturn in access and voice
revenues, while broadband and ultra-broadband revenues have shown growth. In recent years, service
providers have mainly focused on expanding penetration of broadband and ultra-broadband services
and defending voice revenues by introducing bundled voice, broadband and service deals in highly
competitive environment with consequent pricing pressure.

In March 2022, the total number of fixed accesses recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of growth, with
a significant reduction in June 2022 and a slight recovery in the third quarter of 2022[18].

The market scenario shows significant infrastructural interventions, not only by TIM but also by other
subjects, first and foremost Open Fiber, Infratel (operative company of the Ministry of Economic

Development) and Fastweb, which have submitted and are deploying in a great many areas of the
country, the development plans for their fibre optic telecommunications networks.

Competition in the Italian fixed-line telecommunications market is also characterized by the presence
of other service providers besides TIM, such as Wind Tre, Fastweb, Vodafone, and Sky, which have
business models focused on different segments of the market. 2022 saw Iliad enter the ultra-broadband
connectivity sector, which reached around 84 thousand customers in September 2022[19].

The broadband market records a progressive increase in the penetration of ultra-broadband lines with
speeds in excess of 30 Mbps (FTTC, FTTH) with respect to the total number of broadband lines.

The spread of broadband continues to be driven not only by enabling devices (e.g. smart TV, smart
speakers, smart devices) but also by the growing demand for speed and the introduction of new IP
services, which are becoming ever more popular (media and entertainment, IT, digital services).

**_Competition in the mobile telecommunications sector_**

In the mobile market, the solid growth continues of the machine to machine (M2M) SIMs, despite the
fact that the recent outlook has led to a slow-down in the 3rd quarter of 2022, whilst human SIMs, after
a long series of quarters posting a decline, starting the 2nd quarter of 2021 have returned to growth.

Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in
the case of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of
mobile broadband, with significant potential for growth in the medium term, such as the Internet of
Things and mobile payment.

The competitive scenario of the Italian mobile telecommunications market in 2022 continued to be
characterized by an aggressive offer from the operator Iliad in terms of price and volume of data,
followed by those of other operators, resulting in general pressure on market prices. The operator Iliad
and the virtual operators in general continue to win over customers and, consequently, market share, to
the detriment of other infrastructure operators, mainly those with the highest market share.

This scenario has continued to lead to a drop in comprehensive mobile revenues in the first half of 2022
(-3.2% YoY)[20], even if competition pressure on tariffs has eased, with the main mobile operators having
adopted a “more-for-more” commercial positioning, increasing prices in exchange for better network
performance and better overall quality of service.

The competition on 5G continues with the simultaneous presence of TIM, Vodafone, Wind Tre, Iliad
and Fastweb for mobile offers and a progressive coverage of the main cities. The spread of 5G has also
begun in the business segment, enabling specialized solutions for the vertical markets, even if the spread
of these services in this segment has not yet taken off.

**Competition in the Brazilian market (source: Anatel)**

In 2022, the macroeconomic scenario remained under pressure due to inflation, mainly due to food and
energy prices and interest rates. The entire process of the presidential elections entailed great uncertainty
and volatility, leading to the deferral of investments. The contention is clearly polarized between two
populist candidates, which has increased the country’s tax risk. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who won,
had suggested to the market that he would have been able to construct a pragmatic government, close
to that of his first mandate, but the choices that he made for the main country ministries have given rise
to some doubts. If the market previously believed that the interest rates had now stopped rising and that
they would have started dropping in the first half of 2023, now a new increase cannot be excluded,

which would delay the start of the reduction. In addition, on the international scene, the war in Ukraine
that broke out at in early 2022 has had repercussions on the world economy, in particular on the increase
in inflation.

Forecasts for the coming years still suggest a difficult context: volatility looks set to continue at least
for the whole of 2023, in light of the uncertainty of the electoral outcome, the poor economic growth
that limits the capacity to support an increase in income despite an employment rate up since 2021 and
the persistent inflation that requires costs to be managed. As interest rates have been increased in a bid
to slow inflation, TIM expects to see investors shift towards bank investments and a simultaneous
distancing from the stock market.

Maintenance of the “Auxílio Brasil” at 600 reais, with a supplement of 150 reais for each child aged up
to six years old and the increase in the minimum wage with respect to that established previously can
support consumption, including that for telecommunications services.

The mobile telecommunications sector was consolidated in 2022 with the finalization of the sale of Oi.
The buying companies are migrating their customer base and infrastructure. With one operator fewer,
the sector has seen some rationality prevail in the market and in competition, with service providers
maintaining their focus on the development of offers that are increasingly attractive to consumers, not
only in terms of price but also with additional services, for example through partnerships with
companies supplying streaming of video contents. The great challenge consists of increasingly
involving customers, offering a more convenient, more fluid end-to-end experience with all-digital
integration solutions in order to reduce the churn and seek to monetize the customer base.

In the prepaid segment, in November 2022, the customer base had declined by 5.4% YoY, but the
impact of the acquisition of the Oi customer base by TIM, VIVO and Claro, following the switch-off,
was strong. With Oi leaving the market (the most aggressive operator in terms of price) and the
consequent lesser competition, greater rationality is expected on the market. The main aim of market
operators was to increase the percentage use of services, leveraging the SIM card consolidation process
in progress on the market, encouraging migration towards weekly (and monthly) or hybrid (Controle
postpaid) plans, offering a range of service bundles according to the needs of customers (unlimited
voice calls or data packages). This strategy aims to improve the customer base mix and ensure greater
stability (and a reduction in the churn rate) and the growth in ARPU.

In November 2022, the postpaid mobile telephone segment recorded an increase of 6.1% YoY of the
customer base, thanks in particular to the growth of the M2M market but also with significant growth
in the postpaid, ex-M2M, market. This market still suffers the effect of migrations from the prepaid
segments to hybrid “controle”, but this year was particularly marked by the acquisition of the Oi
customer base by TIM, VIVO and Claro, following the switch-off. With Oi off the scene, TIM expects
to see greater market rationality. This growth is based on offer segmentation strategies, through the
introduction of distinctive characteristics in the use of data services (e.g. unlimited use of data on
specific apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, etc.) in pursuing a “More for More” policy
logic that aims to guarantee a greater stability of prices and an effective repositioning of the customer
base on higher value offers (voice + data + bundle with OTT contents).

Service quality is still an element of differentiation. The telecommunication suppliers that have invested
more in the development of 4G networks (coverage and capacity) and in the improvement of processes
shaping customer experiences will have a greater capacity to apply premium prices because customers
increase their expectations and assign increasing importance to the quality of data services and higher
value contents. The main mobile operators already provide 4G coverage for over 99.8% of the Brazilian
population (up to November 2022), with the three main operators offering average 4G availability in
excess of 94% (according to the December 2022 Teleco report).


-----

After the 5G auction in November 2021, 2022 was marked by the beginning of implementation of 5G
in the country by operators. First, 5G was implemented in the country’s major capitals and now will be
following the schedule established on the auction of the most populous cities until completing all the
municipalities. Operators’ ultimate goal is to be able to increase mobile ARPU due to the consumption
of new services enabled by 5G (e.g.: latency-based rates, additional features such as entertainment
packages). The 5G is expected to bring new applications for B2B segment in a lot of industries. The 5G
market already reached 5.1 million subscriptions by November 2022 (representing 2% of the market).

The fixed broadband market registered a slowdown growth in the last year with growth of +7.7% in
November 2022 (YoY), against +11.7% in November 2021 (YoY), maybe impacted by smaller Internet
service providers (ISPs) underreport. The growth comes mainly from ISPs (+16.6% YoY in November
2022), which tend to offer cheaper services and reach areas where traditional operators have limited
infrastructure. The main IPOs that took place in 2021 (Brisanet, Unifique and Desktop) besides other
investment in ISPs brought some capital to increase coverage. As a result, traditional incumbent
operators are experiencing sharp declines in their customer base, with the exception of TIM Live and
Vivo. Population penetration rates are still quite low (around 60%, reaching 72 million households in
Brazil in 2022) when compared to many other countries, which means that there are good opportunities
for growth in the medium term, sustained by the improvement of the macroeconomic situation.

In this context, in 2017 TIM adopted a commercial strategy to enable TIM Live to expand coverage and
its customer base, offering ultra-broadband internet services, mainly through FTTH, not only in some
of the largest cities of Brazil, but also in cities where opportunities are available for a similar highquality service. In addition, focusing on reducing friction points to improve retention. TIM Live has a
customer base of over 712 thousand users in November 2022 (an increase of 4.2% year on year). In
order to achieve faster and smarter growth, the way was to carve-out fibre assets and deployment of
asset light model to accelerate footprint growth. TIM Live was recognized for the 6th year as the best
broadband service by a major Brazilian newspaper.

**REGULATION**

As a telecommunications operator, the TIM Group is subject to sector-specific telecommunications
regulations, general competition law and a variety of other regulations, including privacy and security,
which can have a direct and material effect on the TIM Group’s business areas.

This section describes the legislative framework and the recent legislative key developments.

**THE EU REGULATORY FRAMEWORK**

TIM’s operations within the European Union (“EU”) are subject to the EU regulatory framework for
electronic communications networks and services, which includes directives, regulations,
recommendations and communications. As a Member State of the EU, Italy is required to transpose
directives issued by the EU into national legislation. The regulations are applicable and binding for any
Member State without the need for transposition into national law. Recommendations and
communications are also directly applicable, but they are not legally binding: National Regulatory
Authorities (“NRAs”) and Member States have to take them into account in their activities.

NRAs are independent bodies tasked with regulating and supervising the telecommunications sector
and compliance with the EU framework in each Member State. In Italy, this body is the “Autorità
Garante per le Comunicazioni” (“AGCom”) while the Ministry of Economic Development (“MISE”)
is responsible for the national broadband plan, spectrum and numbering management, integrity and
security of the network.

On 20 December 2018, Directive (EU) 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communication
Code (the “EECC”) entered into force. The Directive reviews and combines in one document the
“Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”, “Authorisation” and “Universal Service and Users’
Rights” Directives (the revision of the Privacy and Data Protection Directive, the so-called e-privacy
Directive, is ongoing under separate proceedings), On the same date, Regulation 2018/1971 also entered
into force, replacing the former Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications
(“BEREC”) Regulation (EC) 1211/2009.

The EECC includes measures to promote wholesale-only models of investments and stimulate
investments in very high capacity network (“VHCN”), new rules on spectrum (e.g. minimum licence
duration) to improve certainty on investment return, changes to regulation of services, introducing an
improved level playing field between telecom operators and new OTT players, and the introduction, in
the scope of Universal Service Obligation (“USO”), of the affordability for consumers (with low
income or special social needs) of adequate broadband internet access service and voice
communications services at least at a fixed location.

In addition, Regulation (EU) 2018/1971, by amending Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, introduces price
caps for five years to be applied from 15 May 2019 on Intra-EU international fixed and mobile calls
(Euro cents (“c€”) 19/min+VAT) and SMS (c€ 6/SMS+VAT) for consumers.

The Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/654 of 18 December 2020 concerning EU maximum
termination published in the OJEU of 22 April 2021 sets the single maximum EU-wide wholesale rates
for fixed and mobile voice termination at 0.07 €cent/min and 0.2 €cent/min respectively. The EU-wide
caps shall apply from 1 July 2021, replacing the regulated fixed and mobile termination rates set by
individual NRAs. For the mobile rate a three-year glide path applies to allow a smooth transition to the
target price: 0.7 €cent/min (0.67 €cent/min for Italy) up to end-2021, 0.55 €cent/min in 2022 and 0.4
€cent/min in 2023).

The Commission Recommendation EU 2020/2245 of 18 December 2020 on “relevant product and
service markets susceptible to ex ante regulation” (Commission’s Recommendation on relevant


-----

markets) completes this set of legal instruments with the definition of a list of relevant markets “whose
characteristics may be such as to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations”. Since the first
Recommendation in 2003, following the growth of the competition in the whole sector, the number of
relevant markets subject to ex ante regulation has been reduced over time from 18 to 2:

1. wholesale local access provided at a fixed location; and

2. wholesale dedicated capacity.

In September 2016, through the Gigabit Society Communication, the European Commission set the
following (non-binding) additional targets for the year 2025:

- gigabit connectivity for all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, transport hubs and
main providers of public services as well as digitally intensive enterprises;

- connectivity of at least 100 mbps download (upgradable to gigabit speed) for all European
households; and

- uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and major terrestrial transport routes (as an
interim target, 5G should be commercially available in at least one major city in each EU
Member State by 2020).

On 9 March 2021, the European Commission adopted the Communication COM (2021) 118 final
concerning 2030 digital compass: the European way for the digital decade. The communication sets
targets and avenues for a successful digital transformation of Europe by 2030 focusing on four cardinal
points:

1. digitally skilled citizens and highly skilled digital professionals: at least 80% of all adults with
basic digital skills and 20 million employed ICT specialists in the EU (with more women taking
up such jobs);

2. secure, functional and sustainable digital infrastructures: gigabit connectivity for all EU
households and 5G coverage for all populated areas; the production of cutting-edge and
sustainable semiconductors in Europe equating to 20% of world production; 10,000 climateneutral highly secure edge nodes in the EU; and the first quantum computer in Europe;

3. digital transformation of businesses: three out of four companies use cloud computing services,
big data and artificial intelligence; more than 90% SMBs with at least a basic level of digital
intensity; and doubling of EU unicorns;

4. digitalisation of public services: all key public services available online; all citizens with access
to their e-medical records and 80% of citizens using an eID solution.

On 12 December 2022, the European Commission adopted the new Guidelines on State aid for
broadband networks C(2022) 9343 final, which update the rules on State aid granted by Member States
for the deployment of (fixed and mobile) broadband networks and the take-up of available broadband
services to support the digital transition. The Guidelines were published in the Official Journal of the
EU on 31 January 2023.

On 19 December 2022, the Decision (EU) 2022/2481 establishing the Digital Decade Policy
Programme was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The policy programme introduces a novel
form of governance based on cooperation between the member states and the European Commission to
ensure that the Union jointly achieves its ambitions. The initiative will enable EU countries to work
closely together and pool resources in order to make progress on digital capabilities and technologies


-----

that individual member states could not reach on their own. The ultimate goal is to achieve a digital
transformation that empowers citizens and businesses, in line with the EU’s values.

On 23 February 2023, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a ‘Gigabit Infrastructure Act’,
a Regulation that will review the current Directive 2014/61/EU with the aim of setting new rules to
enable faster, cheaper and more effective rollout of Gigabit networks across the EU. The Regulation
regards measures on (symmetric) access to existing physical infrastructure, coordination of civil works,
permit granting procedures and in building physical infrastructure. Upon adoption of the Commission’s
proposal by the co-legislators, the new rules will be directly applicable in all the Member States.

On the same date the Commission also unveiled the draft Gigabit Recommendation that, once adopted
by the Commission, will replace Recommendation 2010/572/EU on the regulated access to NGA
networks and the Recommendation 2013/466/EU on non-discrimination and costing methodology.

**1.** **_International Roaming_**

Intra-EU roaming services are regulated by the roaming Regulation 2022/612 which provides for the
prolongation of the Roam Like at Home (RLAH) regime, which abolishes any roaming service
surcharge on top of domestic service prices, subject to “fair use” limits to avoid abuses, until 30 June
2032.

For intra-EU traffic exceeding the fair use limits, operators are allowed to levy a surcharge on top of
domestic tariffs. Such a surcharge is capped at the following wholesale caps.

**from** **from** **from** **from** **from** **from**
**1/7/2022** **1/1/2023** **1/1/2024** **1/1/2025** **1/1/2026** **1/1/2027**

**Voice** _€cent/min_ 2.2 2.2 2.2 1.9 1.9 1.9
**SMS** _€cent/SMS_ 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3
**Data** _€/GB_ 2.0 1.8 1.55 1.3 1.1 1.0

The regulation introduced further benefits and protections for consumers:

- quality of service: roaming providers are obliged to offer the same quality of service in roaming
as is experienced at national level, if the same conditions are available on the network in the
visited country;

- improved access to free emergency services; and

- greater transparency on the costs of value-added services as well as on roaming costs on nonterrestrial mobile networks (ships and planes).

The roaming regulation also foresees a review of the price caps for intra-EU international fixed and
mobile calls, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2018/1971, by 14 May 2024.

**2.** **_Net Neutrality_**

The TSM Regulation introduced rules on Net Neutrality, which have applied since April 2016. In
particular, the TSM Regulation:

- establishes the right of end-user access to distribute information and content, use and provide
applications and services and use terminal equipment of their choice and forbids internet service
providers from blocking or slowing down specific content, applications or services, except in a
very limited set of circumstances;

|Col1|Col2|from 1/7/2022|from 1/1/2023|from 1/1/2024|from 1/1/2025|from 1/1/2026|from 1/1/2027|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Voice|€cent/min|2.2|2.2|2.2|1.9|1.9|1.9|
|SMS|€cent/SMS|0.4|0.4|0.4|0.3|0.3|0.3|
|Data|€/GB|2.0|1.8|1.55|1.3|1.1|1.0|


-----

- allows reasonable traffic management aimed at improving the quality of the network based on
objectively different technical quality of service requirements for specific categories of traffic.
However, such traffic management must be transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate
and it must not be based on commercial considerations;

- allows operators to offer services, other than internet access services, which are optimised for
specific content, applications or services only if the network capacity is sufficient to provide
them in addition to any internet access services provided and the offering of such services is
not to the detriment of the availability or general quality of internet access services for endusers; and

- allows commercial practices subject to monitoring by the National Regulatory Authority.
Contrary to BEREC’s and NRA’s previous indications, the European Court of Justice (ECJ)
rulings in September 2021 established that zero rating[21] infringes the Net Neutrality rules and
is not allowed.

The TSM Regulation also places additional transparency obligations on providers of internet access
services in addition to those already included in the Electronic Communications Regulatory
Framework.

**3.** **_Privacy and Data Protection_**

TIM must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation UE 2016/679 (“GDPR”) since May
2018 (and with the provisions of the Italian privacy code still in force). The new regulation has adopted
a risk based approach, allowing a higher degree of flexibility for service providers to process personal
data, while ensuring a high level of protection of personal data of individuals. The GDPR introduces
administrative fines of up to 4% of an undertaking’s annual global turnover or up to Euro 20,000,000,
whichever is higher, for breaching the new data protection rules.

TIM has put in place a specific project to carry out all the activities needed to ensure its compliance
with the new rules introduced by the GDPR.

While the GDPR is a horizontal regulation, applying to all categories of providers, TIM must also
comply with the complimentary sectorial rules (Directive 2002/58/EC, the so called “e-Privacy
Directive”), currently under revision, which imposes additional limitations on the data processing by
operators of electronic communications services. The EC proposal aligns the fines for non-compliance
to those of the GDPR.

**_4._** **_Security_**

The new Directive 2022/2555 on Network and Information Systems (“NIS2”), which replaces the
current Directive 2016/1148 (NIS), entered into force on 16 January 2023, shall be transposed into
national legislation by 17 October 2024 and will be applicable starting from 18 October 2024.

NIS2 sets forth the extension of the scope of application of the rules on the security of networks and
information systems, including - on the one hand - sectors currently covered by other regulations, which
are simultaneously repealed (i.e. the security measures of networks and services of electronic
communications, currently included in the European Electronic Communications Code) and - on the
other hand - extending the rules to new subjects (e.g. Data centres, CDNs, etc.).

21 Zero-rating (also called toll-free data or sponsored data) is the practice of mobile network operators (MNO), mobile virtual network operators
(MVNO), and Internet Service Providers (ISP) not to charge end customers for data used by specific applications or internet services through
their network, in limited or metered data plans. It allows customers to use provider-selected content sources or data services like an app store,
without worrying about bill shocks, which could otherwise occur if the same data was normally charged according to their data plans and
volume caps. This has especially become an option to market 4G networks but has also been used in the past for SMS or other content services.


-----

NIS2 maintains the obligation to adopt security measures proportionate to the risk, however introducing
a series of minimum requirements, including supply chain security management, and revises the
mandatory notification procedure for cyber incidents.

The penalties for non-compliance can be up to 2% of annual turnover.

**THE ITALIAN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK**

The main legal references for the electronic communications sector in Italy is the “Electronic
Communications Code” (ECC), which transposed into national law the EU Access, Authorisation,
Framework and Universal Service directives. With the law no. 119/2018 dated 18 December 2018, the
Government amended the ECC introducing the power for AGCom to define adequate measures of
investment remuneration to incentivise the merger of different access networks placed under the control
of a non-vertically integrated subject offering only wholesale network services.

The new ECC, approved by the European Commission with Directive 2018/1972, was transposed into
Italian law on December 2021.

Moreover, there are other laws affecting TIM’s business which govern non-sectorial areas such as
consumer, data and security protection, high consumption of electricity and gas, and laws which govern
specific aspects of the communication sector such as: Decree-Law no 76/2020 (converted into Law no.
120 of 11 September 2020) and Decree-Law no. 77/2021 (converted into Law no. 108 of 29 July
2021), known as “Simplification Decrees”, which contain important simplification measures to
accelerate the completion of both 5G and the ultra-broadband fibre optic networks.

In this regard, also:

- Decree - Law no. 21/2022 (also known as “Ukrainian Decree”), converted into Law no. 51 of
20 May 2022, which contains important simplification measures for the development of the
mobile network.

- Decree - Law no. 36/2022 (also known as “PNRR 2 Decree”), converted into Law no. 29 of
June 2022, which introduces measures in “Electronic Communications Code” (ECC), in
particular, simplified authorization measures for mobile network development.

- Decree - Law no. 13/2023 (also known as “PNRR 3 Decree”), presented to the Italian
Parliament, which introduces other important simplification measures in the authorization
process, and for the development of fixed and mobile ultra-broadband.

During 2022, the Italian Government, in order to contain the effects of the increase in the price of
electricity and gas, has also approved measures to support companies (energy consuming and not), in
particular, the Decree Law, also known as “Decreti Aiuti”, and the “Budget Law 2023” (Law no 197
of 29 December 2022) which increased the tax credit on the consumption of energy and gas for the
companies (for the first quarter of 2023 has been disposed tax credit increase of 35% for electricity and
45% for gas).

**Market analyses**

The EU regulatory framework requires that National Regulatory Authorities carry out market analyses
before imposing obligations on individual operators having a significant market power (“SMP”)
according to the specific EU guidelines.

A description of the Italian wholesale market analyses is summarised below, together with the main
recent developments regarding the electronic communications markets.


-----

**_Wholesale fixed access markets_**

Decision No 348/19/CONS published on 8 August 2019 set the obligations and economic conditions of
wholesale access services for the period 2018-2021.

In November 2020, AGCom concluded the preliminary assessment of TIM’s voluntary separation
project for the creation of FiberCop (Newco, controlled by TIM and owned by KKR Infrastructure Fund
and Fastweb, which on 31 March 2021 acquired the secondary copper and fibre access network owned
by TIM and Flash Fiber).

With Decision No 637/20/CONS, published in December 2020, the Authority started the coordinated
analysis of the markets for fixed network access services pursuant to Article 50-ter of the Code and, at
the same time, launched the public consultation on the voluntary separation project of TIM’s fixed
access network, whose outcomes were published in October 2021 with Decision No. 253/21/CONS.

This procedure, which should be completed in the course of 2023, will update the regulatory framework
for the markets for wholesale fixed network access services on the basis of changed competitive
conditions and new market structures, including the new corporate and organisational structure of TIM,
which is in the process of being established, and the TIM commitments relating to the offer to co-invest
in a VHC network submitted pursuant to Articles 76 and 79 CCEE, as will be made binding by the
Authority at the end of the evaluation procedure.

**_TIM’s transformation plan_**

At the meeting on 6 July the Board of Directors approved the Issuer’s strategic reorganisation objective
aimed at overcoming vertical integration and gave the CEO the mandate to evaluate and submit to the
Administrative Body for the decisions of the case, any transactions and possible agreements for the
transfer and valuation of certain TIM Group assets, appropriate to the achievement of that strategic
target.

The transformation plan, which will require approximately 15-18 months, provides in particular for the
separation of fixed network assets, including the primary and secondary access network in copper and
fibre, the wholesale domestic activities and the shareholdings held in FiberCop S.p.A. and TI Sparkle
S.p.A., which will be merged into NetCo.

The TIM fixed network separation plan announced to the market represents, both in terms of
infrastructure and future governance, a clear departure from the FiberCop separation model of the
copper and fibre secondary access network only, notified to the Authority, pursuant to art. 89 of the
new Electronic Communications Code (ex-art. 50ter CCE), dated 2 September 2020 and the subject of
the procedure of coordinated analysis of access markets started by Decision No. 637/20/CONS.

**_Co-investment Offer in a VHC network_**

On 20 January 2021 TIM notified to the Authority an offer to co-invest in the construction of a new
fibre network pursuant to Articles 76 and 79 of the New European Code of Electronic communications
(CCEE) in order to assess its conformity with the aforementioned art. 76 for the deregulation of the new
fibre infrastructure.

This offer was subsequently amended and integrated by TIM in March, April and finally in December
2021 in light of the indications provided by the Authority in the “Preliminary Conclusions” transmitted
to TIM at the end of the market test commenced by Decision No. 110/21/CONS.

The co-investment project is open to any provider of electronic communications networks or services
and is the first case of European co-investment at a national level and the application of the new Code.


-----

In particular, the project will achieve a total of 9.7 million THH (Technical Households) in 2,549
municipalities by April 2026.

On 11 January 2022, AGCom published Decision No. 1/22/CONS which launched the public
consultation, which ended on 9 February 2022, on the regulatory treatment of the FiberCop fibre
network covered by the Co-investment Offer.

The decision under consultation provides for the approval of co-investment commitments that are made
binding for a period of ten years pursuant to art. 76 of the new European Electronic Communications
Code (CCEE). In particular, TIM will be bound by these commitments and will not be subject to any
additional regulatory obligation on the secondary fibre network in all municipalities where at least a coinvestment agreement has been concluded between an alternative operator and FiberCop with respect
to the following services:

- semi-GPON access;

- access to the laying infrastructure and dark fibre on the secondary network;

- access to the vertical fibre termination segment;

- any other possible access service that exists only on the secondary network subject to coinvestment.

On 16 May 2022, the Authority notified the draft measure to the European Commission. However, on
7 June 2022 AGCom withdrew the notification following TIM’s notification of an indexation
mechanism to the price inflation of the co-investment Offer, to take account of the recent, unforeseen
and significant increase in inflation. The indexation mechanism was subsequently amended by TIM in
July and October 2022 on the basis of indications provided by the Authority.

With Decision No 385/22/CONS published on 7 November 2022 AGCom launched a market test on
the staggered mechanism of indexation of prices proposed by TIM to set the annual inflation rate to be
applied to the prices of the Co-investment Offer from 2023. The Offer also extends the application of
the economic conditions for 2021 to co-investors joining by April 2023.

This inquiry does not involve the renewal in full of the procedure, but it is limited to assessing the
compliance of the new prices with the criteria laid down in the Code, based also on the outcomes of the
market test after which the notification will be renewed in the European Commission.

On 9 February 2023, the Authority communicated to TIM its preliminary conclusions requiring a
revision of the price indexation model of the co-investment offer. The necessary in-depth analysis of
the preliminary findings made by the Authority in order to formulate the Issuer’s response is ongoing.

**_2022 and 2023 prices for wholesale fixed network access services_**

With Decision No. 337/22/CONS, subsequently supplemented with Decision No. 388/22/CONS,
AGCom submitted to public consultation, which concluded on 5 December, regarding the prices for
2022-2023 for wholesale access services to the fixed network of copper and fibre TIM/FiberCop.

As clarified by the Authority, this measure is necessary in order to ensure, pending the completion of
the coordinated analysis of the access markets triggered by Decision No.637/20/CONS, the necessary
regulatory predictability for all operators active in the market, both at wholesale and retail level, and
avoid the retroactive application of economic conditions, as repeatedly requested by the European
Commission.


-----

After the operators’ hearings, on 27 March 2023 the Authority notified the European Commission the
following 2023 fees of the main wholesale access services compared to the values approved for 2021.

**2023** **2021-2022**

**Variation**

**SERVICES** **Fees** **Fees**

**(2023 vs 2021)**

**(€)** **(€)**

**GPON LLU**

**(not subject to ex ante regulation)**

**LLU** 10.03 8.90 +12.8%
**SLU** 5.99 5.30 +13.1%
**FTTC VULA** 13.20 12.50 +5.6%
**Dark fibre in primary access network – 15 years IRU** 1,876,93 2,484.53 -24.5%
**Dark fibre in secondary access network – 15 years IRU** 1,318,37 1,563.1 -15.7%

15.20 (2021)
**FTTH VULA** 14.39 -6.3%
14.69 (2022)

**Fibre in-house wiring** 2.52 2.80 -9.9%
**Copper in-house wiring** 0.52 0.47 +10.8%%

_Source:https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/2328c58f-1fed-4402-a6cc-0f0237699dc3/library/b9ebb4db-84dc-45a8-83f7-_

_230babc3989e/details_

The proposal reduces the differential between wholesale access prices in fibre and copper by creating,
on the one hand, an incentive to invest in new FTTH networks for both the incumbent and new entrants,
and on the other hand, an acceleration of customer migration from legacy networks to new fibre
networks.

Final decision is expected by mid-May 2023.

**_Terminating segment of leased lines_**

The decision 333/20/CONS published on 31 August 2020:

- withdraws ex ante regulation in the competitive area of Milan;

- removes the cost-orientation obligation for leased lines services in the contestable areas (24
municipalities);

- withdraws the access obligation to provide, for new activations, the following services:

° analogue terminating circuits;

° digital PDH terminating circuits with a speed less or equal than 2 Mbps;

° Ethernet over SDH terminating;

° Ethernet over SDH interconnection links.

Consistently with a previous round of market analysis prices of PDH, SDH circuits are set according to
a network cap model valid for the years 2019-2021, while corresponding one-off fees are reduced by
2% per year. On the other hand, monthly fees and one-off fees of terminating Ethernet over optical fibre
services will be evaluated yearly on the Reference Offer approval procedure.

With Decision No. 337/22/CONS, AGCom has proposed that in no contestable areas:

- the prices of the terminating circuits and interconnection links, other than Ethernet over optical
fibre, are set for the years 2022 and 2023 as equal to the values approved by the Authority for
the year 2021; and

|2023 2021-2022 Variation SERVICES Fees Fees (2023 vs 2021) (€) (€)|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|GPON LLU (not subject to ex ante regulation)|11.46|11.63|-1.5%|
|LLU|10.03|8.90|+12.8%|
|SLU|5.99|5.30|+13.1%|
|FTTC VULA|13.20|12.50|+5.6%|
|Dark fibre in primary access network – 15 years IRU|1,876,93|2,484.53|-24.5%|
|Dark fibre in secondary access network – 15 years IRU|1,318,37|1,563.1|-15.7%|
|FTTH VULA|14.39|15.20 (2021) 14.69 (2022)|-6.3%|
|Fibre in-house wiring|2.52|2.80|-9.9%|
|Copper in-house wiring|0.52|0.47|+10.8%%|


-----

- the prices of terminating Ethernet over optical fibre, as well as of the related ancillary services,
for the year 2022 are equal to the corresponding values set for 2021, while they are cost-oriented
for the year 2023 and will be evaluated yearly on the Reference Offer approval procedure.

**_Wholesale fixed interconnection markets_**

On 2 February 2022, AGCom published Decision 13/22/CONS withdrawing the regulation of voice
call origination on a fixed network (including the third billing obligation) after a transitional period of
24 months and simplifying the regulation of voice fixed termination, as specified below.

- confirmation of the status of SPM operator for TIM and 25 other operators;

- until 30 June 2021, confirmation of the 2019 termination price (0,041 €/cent min);

- from 1 July 2021, entry into force of the single maximum EU-wide wholesale rate (0,07
€cent/min);

- cost orientation, under a symmetrical regime for the prices of ancillary and additional services
to the termination service;

- withdrawal of cost accounting and accounting separation obligations, as well as of half-yearly
reporting obligations, for termination services without providing for any transitional period;
and

- reduction (from 12 to 6 months) of the notice required from notified operators for the
decommissioning of one or more DTM interconnection nodes, as well as removal from the
publication of the final decision on the obligation to activate new interconnections with a TDM
interface.

**_Wholesale mobile markets_**

On 22 January 2019, AGCom published the final decision on the fifth round of mobile termination
market analysis (Decision 599/18/CONS). AGCom determined to:

- identify the 12 operators who provide or are about to provide mobile voice call termination
services (MNOs, Iliad included, and Full MVNOs) as having SMP;

- confirm the implementation of the cost model specified in Decision 60/11/CONS for the setting
of termination rates for the period 2018-2021, also by setting symmetric tariffs per minute for
all SMP operators (c€ 0.98 in 2018, c€ 0.90 in 2019, c€ 0.76 in 2020, and c€ 0.67 in 2021 (“c€”
means Euro cents)) on the basis of a WACC equal to 8.55%;

- enforce the price control obligation for the provision of interconnection kits to all SMP
operators with retroactive effect from 2018;

- withdraw the cost accounting obligation enforced on TIM, Vodafone and Wind-Tre; and

- confirm the absence of a termination price control obligation for calls originating outside the
EEA; however, operators cannot apply higher termination rates than those applied to Italian
operators by extra-AEE operators whose tariffs are regulated by the relevant authorities.

Pursuant to the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/654, a three-year glide path
applies to allow a smooth transition to the target price of 0.2 €cent/min:0.67 €cent/min up to end-2021,
0.55 €cent/min in 2022 and 0.4 €cent/min in 2023.


-----

**RETAIL MARKETS**

**_Retail Offers_**

With Decision 348/19/CONS, AGCom has removed the ex ante replicability test for some of TIM’s
ultra-broadband retail offers.

In particular, all retail offers (including bundles) considered “flagship”, with speeds equal to or higher
than 100 mbps (which are very relevant in the migration phase from copper to NGA), will be notified
to AGCom at the same time as their launch and will be subject to the supervision of AGCom on an ex
post basis through the replicability test.

The “renewal of offers”, the “modifications of already existing offers which do not imply a change of
margins” and the “optional conditional sales associated to an already approved offer” will be notified
to AGCom at the same time as their launch; AGCOM will eventually assess their replicability, if
considered necessary, ex officio or at the request of an operator.

All the rest of the retail offers will continue to be notified in advance, 20 days before their launch
(previously 30 days), in order to allow an ex ante application of the replicability test by AGCom.

In the fourth quarter of 2022 TIM launched the 10/2 Gigabit/s FTTH retail offer (both consumer and
business markets).

**_28-DAY billing_**

In June 2019, TIM had in any case decided to offer its fixed network customers, which were active prior
to 31 March 2018 and subject to billing every 28 days, the possibility of accepting a compensatory
solution, an alternative to refunding the eroded days pursuant to AGCom resolution no. 269/18/CONS.

Subsequently, from September 2019, TIM decided to also accept requests for the refund of the eroded
days. In both cases, TIM informed customers with several messages in the bill, on the web in the main
newspapers.

**_Guidelines for online termination and switching costs_**

On 2 November 2018, AGCom published the Decision 487/18/CONS setting the new guidelines on the
charges applicable by operators in the event of customers’ withdrawal.

Law no. 40/2007 (“Bersani Law”) allowed customers to withdraw from the permanent contract at any
time, provided that the costs they have to pay for the line termination or switching shall be real and
economically justified (e.g. deactivation costs for the fixed line).

The Bersani Law was subsequently amended by the Italian competition law no. 124/2017 and decision
487/18/CONS aims at implementing the new provisions. However, AGCom introduces additional
charges for operators. In particular:

- withdrawal in case of line termination or switching: the cost to be paid by the costumer is the
lower of the average rental fee (contract value) and the actual deactivation cost;

- promotions: in case of early termination (in respect to the duration of the promotion), operators
may only charge a share of the discounts proportionate to the residual duration of the promotion
at the moment of the withdrawal; and


-----

- products with instalments offered in conjunction with the electronic communication service:
users can decide to pay the remaining instalments instead of reimbursing them with a single
payment.

TIM has challenged AGCom’s decision before the administrative court regarding the provisions that
limit the right to fully recover the costs in case of withdrawal (discounts based on promotions, product
installments). The administrative judge rejected TIM’s appeal because it considered the act not directly
harmful.

In 2021 TIM again challenged the decision because it is the prerequisite for an AGCom sanctioning
provision on the subject of withdrawal.

**_Terminal equipment for internet access_**

On 2 August 2018 AGCom approved the final decision (“Decision 348/18/CONS”) on terminal
equipment (modem) for internet access.

With this resolution AGCom clarifies that the modem is not part of the network and, therefore, the
user’s freedom of choice must be guaranteed as established by the TSM Regulation.

From 1 December 2018 the new offers must ensure that the customer can freely choose their terminal.

Decision 348/18/CONS also requires operators to:

- remove any technical limitations of the modem, to allow the customer to use it for similar
services provided by other operators;

- not request additional charges if the modem, which was provided free of charge and not used
permanently by the user, is not returned to the operator; and

- change the offer of current subscribers who in the past have been obliged to accept the paid
provision of a modem, with a free of charge modem supply or, alternatively, give customers
the right of withdrawal without any penalty.

TIM is compliant from 1 December 2018 with the free choice of the modem provision, however TIM
deems that the aforementioned additional obligations are illegitimate and unjustified; therefore, TIM
has appealed the Decision 348/18/CONS before the Lazio administrative court (“TAR”) (Tribunale
_Amministrativo Regionale). The obligation concerning the change of offer of current subscribers, who_
in the past have been obliged to accept the paid provision of a modem, has been suspended by the
Council of State pending the hearing at the TAR of Lazio set for 23 October 2019.

In January 2020, the administrative judge only partially accepted TIM’s appeal. TAR has only
considered illegitimate a request for additional charges if the modem, which was provided free of charge
and not permanently owned by the user, is not returned to the operator.

TIM will appeal against TAR judgment.

In May 2020, TIM has communicated to its customers that have signed up an offer for internet access
and modem instalment sale before 1 December 2019, the possibility of joining an equivalent offer of
Internet without modem and allowance for residual instalments.

On 2 August 2021, the Council of State definitively rejected TIM’s appeal.


-----

**THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE**

The Universal Service (“US”) is a minimum set of services of a certain quality, which must be made
available to all customers, regardless of their geographical location in Italy, and which must be offered
at a reasonable price, taking into account specific national conditions. To date, TIM is the only operator
obliged by the code of electronic communications (art. 58) to provide the Universal Service under the
universal service obligation (“USO”) throughout Italy. Currently the services included in the USO are
the provision of access at a fixed location and of telephone service, the directory inquiry service and
the directories, the availability of public payphones, and the provision of specific measures for disabled
users.

A fund (the “Universal Service Fund”), established by the ministry of communications, is used to
finance the net cost for the provision of universal service sustained by the designated operator (TIM)
by means of contributions paid by the other operators. All the main companies active in the sector,
including TIM, must contribute to this fund.

AGCom is responsible for verifying the net cost of the USO provision and assessing whether this
amount represents an unfair burden for the operator. The designated operator can receive compensation
only if the burden is determined to be unfair.

AGCom assessed the net cost and authorised the funding mechanism until the year 2005 and did not
recognise any contribution for the years 2006 and 2007.

The net cost for the provision of USO for the years 2004-2007 has been calculated on the basis of a
methodology established by AGCom in 2008 (decision 01/08/CIR) with retroactive effect, which led to
a significant decrease in the amount to be financed.

Following Judgment no. 4616/2015, released on 2 October 2015, by which the Council of State
overruled AGCom’s decision 1/08/CIR on the application of the new methodological criteria for the
calculation of the USO net cost related to the years 2004-2007, AGCom initiated proceedings for the
review of the calculation with decision 145/17/CONS for the years 2006-2007 and decision
207/17/CONS for the years 2004-2005. With decision 103/19/CIR notified on 11 September 2019, the
authority has recognised the existence of a supplementary net cost USO for all years from 2004 to 2007
inclusive, charged to the other operators, equal to 26.7 million euro. Furthermore, with decision
88/18/CIR, published on 21 June 2018, AGCom has set the net cost for the year 2008 equal to zero and
the net cost for the year 2009 equal to 11.61 million euro, which is to be shared by the fixed and mobile
operators.

With respect to past litigation, the council of state, with a decision published on 7 July 2015, rejected
the appeal filed by TIM against the decision of the TAR on AGCom’s decisions of 2010 by which
AGCom had reviewed the proceedings for the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003. As a result, the Council
of State annulled AGCom’s decision of 2010 establishing a possible second renewal of the proceedings
for the calculation of the contributions of the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003. The authority began the
renewal proceedings for the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003 with decision 102/19/CIR on 11
September 2019.

Following the Council of State decision, Vodafone requested TIM to refund the amounts paid for 19992000, 2002-2003 and subsequent periods. With a new decision published in October 2019, the Council
of State accepted the appeal of Vodafone, stating the obligation for TIM to return the disputed sums.

In September 2020, AGCom ended the public consultation related to the review of the unfairness of the
net cost burden of the universal service 1999–2009. In resolution 263/20/CIR, the authority defined a
new approach to demonstrate the unfairness of the net USO cost for the years under examination. On
the basis of the new approach, AGCom recognised the unfairness of the charge for the years 2002 –


-----

2009. For the previous years 1999 – 2000, however, the authority did not find the existence of an unfair
charge for TIM.

On 29 March 2021, AGCom, with the publication of decision 18/21/CIR, confirmed the obligation of
mobile operators to participate in the USO contribution mechanism for the years 2001 – 2009,
confirming the opinion expressed by the same authority during the public consultation.

On 17 February 2022, the TAR annulled resolution no 18/21/CIR accepting a single ground of appeal
by the OAOs with which the threshold parameter relating to the unfairness of the burden (2^ facie) was
contested with regard to the economic and financial impacts on the person in charge. The further
grounds of appeal of the OAOs were instead rejected by the TAR.

On 27 June 2022, AGCom published decision no 1/22/CIR suspending the terms established by decision
no 92/21/CIR, already extended by decision no 58/22/CONS and by decision no 143/22/CONS, pending
the appeal judgment pending before the Council of State. The preliminary hearings of the Council of
State have been set for 4 and 27 April 2023.

The authority’s decision was challenged by the other operators. Vodafone and Wind requested the
suspension of the payment of the shares to the fund set up at MISE until the conclusion of the procedure.
The MISE informed the fixed and mobile OAOs to not proceed to the payment of contribution shares
of the annuity in question.

As regards the Universal Service Quality targets, the Council of State issued a sentence on 21 April
2022 in which it annulled the sanction imposed on TIM by AGCom Decision No. 28/11/CONS for €
174,000 related to the overshooting of quality targets for the year 2009.

The Council of State accepted TIM’s appeal which denounced the illegitimacy of the sanction following
the failure to transpose the commitments proposal presented by TIM during the sanctioning procedure.

**CONTRIBUTION FEES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF AGCOM**

TIM and the other operators are required to pay contribution fees to fund the running costs of AGCom.
These fees are calculated on the basis of each operator’s revenues.

On 31 January 2022, AGCom issued decision no. 376/21/CONS and 377/21/CONS relating to the
payment of the AGCom contribution for the year 2022 (calculated on the data of the 2020 financial
statements). The guidelines for calculating the contribution rate are unchanged compared to the
guidelines for calculating the 2021 contribution. For 2022, AGCom confirmed the rate of 1.30 per
thousand for the electronic communications market and 1.90 per thousand for “media” services. On the
basis of this rate, TIM paid approximately 15.677 million euros, under reserve.

**GOVERNMENT’S UBB NETWORK STATE AID PLANS**

In June 2016, the European Commission authorised the Italian government UBB State Aid Plan for a
total amount of 4 billion euro aimed at covering almost 25% of the population living in about 7,200
municipalities belonging to the so-called UBB “white areas” (areas in which there is no NGA network
available and there is no interest of private operators to deploy it in the near future) of Italy. The 7,200
municipalities are grouped into two clusters, C and D. In cluster C, 70% of connections have to reach
at least 100 mbit/s download and 50 mbit/s upload, while the remaining 30% have to reach at least 30
mbit/s download and 15 mbit/s upload. In cluster D, 100% of connections have to reach at least 30
mbit/s download and 15 mbit/s upload.

On 3 June 2016 Infratel published a first call for tender of 1.4 billion euro for deploying and managing
under a 20-year concession an UBB “passive” infrastructure (ducts and dark fibre) in the white areas of


-----

six regions (Abruzzo, Molise, Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Toscana and Veneto). On 7 March 2017,
the first tender was awarded to Open Fiber.

On 8 August 2016, Infratel called for a second tender for the ultra-broadband “white areas” of 10
additional Italian regions (Piemonte, Valle d’Aosta, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Marche, Umbria,
Lazio, Campania, Basilicata and Sicilia) and in the Trento Autonomous Province, for a total public
financing of approximately 1.25 billion euro. TIM decided to not submit any bid. On 28 July 2017, the
second tender was awarded to Open Fiber.

The Italian Strategy for Ultra-Broadband - “Towards the Gigabit Society”, approved on 25 May 2021
by the Interministerial Committee for the Digital Transition (CITD), defines the actions necessary to
achieve the digital transformation objectives indicated by the European Commission in 2016 and in
2021 – respectively with the Communication on Connectivity for a single European digital market (socalled “Gigabit Society”) and the Communication on the digital decade (so-called “Digital compass”)
with which it presented the vision, objectives and methods for achieving the digital transformation of
Europe by 2030.

The NRRP approved by the Government on 29 April 2021 allocates 27% of resources to the digital
transition, of which 6.7 billion euros are for strategic projects for ultra-broadband, in continuity with
the Strategy launched by the Government in 2015. The Strategy, in addition to having as its objective
the completion of the coverage plan for white areas and the measures to support demand already started
(so-called vouchers), provides for five further public intervention plans to cover the geographical areas
in which the supply of infrastructures and very high-speed digital services by market operators is absent
or insufficient, and it is expected to be the same in the next few years.

The NRRP allocates a total of 6.7 billion euros for ultra-broadband projects distributed over the
following Plans:

- “Italy at 1 Giga” plan (3.86 billion euros);

- “Italy 5G” plan (2.02 billion euros);

- No 4G/5G areas (1 billion euro);

- 5G corridors (0.6 billion euros);

- 5G ready suburban roads (0.42 billion euros);

- “Connected Health” Plan (0.50 billion euros);

- “Connected School” plan (0.26 billion euros);

- “Smaller islands” plan (0.06 billion euro).

Through these measures, the Government intends to bring forward to 2026 - therefore by a good four
years - the 1 Gigabit/s connectivity objectives for all and full 5G coverage of populated areas set by the
new European Digital Compass strategy for 2030.

These European digital transformation objectives are developed around four cardinal points: (1) digital
skills; (2) digitization of public services; (3) the digital transformation of enterprises; and (4) the
creation of secure and sustainable digital infrastructures. As regards the latter, one of the objectives set
by the European Commission is to allow all EU households to benefit from Gigabit connectivity by
2030 and that all inhabited areas are covered by 5G networks.


-----

**“Italy at 1 Giga” plan (3.86 billion euros)**

The “Italy at 1 Giga” plan envisages guaranteeing fixed coverage of 1 Giga in download and at least
200 Mbit/s in upload in the grey and black areas where, until 2026, the plans of private operators cannot
guarantee “reliable” connections with at least 100 Mbit/s download.

In this context, in April 2021, Infratel started mapping the UBB 2021-2026 fixed coverage plans by all
private operators, including FWA coverage out of a total of 21.3 million grey and black addresses, as
resulting from the previous mappings.

The results of the fixed mapping were published on 6 August 2021.

By identifying a coverage of 300 Mbit/s as an intervention threshold, approximately 6.2 million street
addresses without coverage at 300 Mbit/s were identified as the object of public intervention.

Following a public consultation on the methods of intervention, calls for tenders with an incentive
model on a regional or multi-regional basis will be used for the disbursement of public funding.

In the same streaming of the “Italy at 1 Giga” Plan, on 13 October 2021 Infratel launched a
complementary consultation which ended on 15 November 2021, relating to the updating of the
mapping of the UBB fixed coverage of the “White Areas” of the 2016 BUL Plan, which includes a total
of 11.8 million civilians:

- the street numbers of the BUL tenders awarded to the public concessionaire Open Fiber; and

- street numbers corresponding to approximately 450,000 real estate units located in remote areas
(so-called “scattered houses”), not included in previous public intervention plans.

The purpose of the mapping is to identify the house numbers present in the aforementioned areas that
have been excluded from public intervention and will not be reached, in the next five years (30/9/21 30/9/26), by private investments suitable for guaranteeing a download connection speed of at least 300
Mbit/s during peak hours.

On the basis of the coverage plans declared by Open Fiber and private operators, 1.6 million street
addresses not covered at 300 Mbit/s have been identified by 2026 which will be the subject of public
funding for the completion of the “Italy at 1 Giga”.

The “Italy at 1 Giga Plan” was notified to the European Commission on 8 November 2021 and was
approved on 27 January 2022.

On 15 January 2022, Infratel published the Italy at 1 Giga call for tenders for the granting of public
grants for the financing of investment projects for the construction of new telecommunications
infrastructures and related access equipment capable of providing services with at least 1 Gigabit/s in
download and 200 Mbit/s in upload, with a deadline of 31 March 2022.

The citizens involved in the tender (about 6.9 million) are divided into 15 lots and the funding foreseen
in the tender is equal to 3.68 billion euros. Each competitor will be able to win up to a maximum of
eight lots.

The public contribution will cover up to 70% of the expenses incurred, while a share of no less than
30% will be paid by the beneficiary. The results of the tenders were published on 24 May 2022 and are
as follows:


-----

- TIM won the tenders relating to: Sardinia (lot 1), Abruzzo, Molise, Marche and Umbria (lot 3),
Piedmont, Liguria and Val d’Aosta (lot 4), South Calabria (lot 5), North Calabria Cs (lot 11)
and Basilicata (lot 14) for a total of approximately 1.6 billion euros

- OF won the tenders relating to: Puglia (lot 2), Tuscany (lot 6), Lazio (lot 7), Sicily (lot 8),
Emilia-Romagna (lot 9) Campania (lot 10), Friuli Venezia Giulia-Veneto (lot 12) and
Lombardy (lot 13) for a total of approximately 1.8 billion euros.

The tender relating to Trento and Bolzano (lot 15) was resubmitted with a deadline of 3 June and was
awarded to TIM on 28 June 2022 for a total of approximately 65 million euros.

On 29 July 2022, the Agreements were signed between Infratel and the operators that had been awarded
the individual lots.

**“Italy 5G” plan (2.02 billion euros)**

The “Italy 5G” plan provides for 5G coverage with 150 Mbit/s download and at least 50 Mbit/s upload
in the following areas:

- European 5G corridors (2,645 km) -> 420 million euros;

- Extra-urban roads ready for 5G (10,000 km) -> 600 million euros;

- No 5G/4G areas -> 1 billion euros.

To identify the areas to be financed, Infratel has mapped the 4G and 5G 2021-2026 mobile coverage
plans of private operators, including the sites’ fibre backhauling connections.

As a result of the consultation, the following were identified as subjects of public intervention:

- 13,200 mobile radio sites, which include approximately 18,600 SRBs (Radio Base Stations) on
which to implement fibre backhauling;

- 15% of the national territory to which, however, only 1.6% of the population belongs, but with
important land transport routes such as roads and railways, to be covered by 5G.

These results were subject to public consultation until 15 December 2021.

Following the results of the public consultation, on 21 March 2022 Infratel published two tenders to
encourage the creation, by 2026, of infrastructures for the development of 5G networks in the country
without investments from the market:

1. Fibre Backhauling Tender; and

2. New 5G Sites Tender.

The European Commission approved the aid measure, including both tenders on 25 April 2022.

The deadline for submitting offers expired on 9 May 2022.

**1.** **Fibre Backhauling Tender**

The tender provides for investment incentives for the construction of fibre optic links of over 10,000
existing mobile radio sites up to 90% of the cost of the same.


-----

It is divided into six multi-regional lots and offers a total of 949,132,899 euros.

On 13 June 2022, all six lots were awarded to TIM for a total value of 725,043,820 euros.

On 29 July 2022, the Agreements relating to the individual lots were signed between Infratel and TIM.

**2.** **New 5G Sites Tender**

The second tender encourages the construction of new 5G mobile network infrastructures (fibre,
infrastructure and electronic components) in more than 2400 areas of the country with transmission
speeds of at least 150 Mbit/s downlink and 30 Mbit/s uplink, also to be financed up to 90% of the total
cost.

The second tender is also divided into six multi-regional lots, but different from the previous ones, and
offers a total of 974,016,970 euros.

The second tender for the construction of new 5G sites was abandoned and was republished with
changes on 20 May with a deadline of 10 June 2022.

The new call provides for funding of 567,043,033 euros on fewer sites to be connected than the previous
one (-50%).

On 28 June 2022, Infratel announced that all six lots were awarded to Inwit S.p.A. (“INWIT”) in
forming a temporary joint venture with TIM and Vodafone for a total of approximately 346 million
euros.

On 29 July 2022, the agreements relating to the individual lots were signed between Infratel and the
group of companies led by INWIT.

**“Connected Health” plan**

The “Connected Health” plan aims to provide connectivity with symmetrical speeds starting from 1
Gigabit/s up to 10 Gigabit/s to approximately 12,280 healthcare facilities throughout the country.

To implement the Plan, on 28 January 2022 Infratel launched a tender for the supply of ultra-broadband
connectivity services at the public health service facilities in Italy, including the supply and installation
of the access network and management and maintenance services, expiring on 11 April 2022.

The call provides for an allocation of 387 million euros and is divided into eight territorial lots and the
same subject can be awarded up to a maximum of four lots.

The provisional award of the tenders was communicated on 6 June 2022.

The total amount awarded was 314 million euros.

TIM won two of the eight lots comprising the regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Marche and
Umbria, being awarded around 78 million euros.

On 20 September 2022, the Agreements relating to the individual lots won were signed between Infratel
and TIM.

**“Connected School” plan**

The “Connected School” Plan aims to complete the 2020-2023 School Plan launched by the
Government on 5 May 2020, which provided for the supply of an ultra-broadband connection up to 1


-----

Gigabit/s with 100 Mbit/s guaranteed at 35,000 school buildings (about 78% of the total), i.e. all the
buildings of the first and second level secondary schools in the country and, in the “white areas”, also
the connection of all the primary and kindergarten complexes.

The 2020-2023 School Plan was conducted by Infratel which, between September and December 2020,
carried out a public consultation and issued a call for tenders with public funding of 274 million euros
divided into seven lots on a geographical basis (with a limit of two lots that can be assigned to the same
bidder who can submit bids for all lots).

On 26 February 2021 the award of the individual lots was communicated.

The total amount awarded was 271 million euros.

TIM won two of the eight lots, including the regions of Tuscany, Veneto, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise and
Puglia, for around 84 million euros.

The new “Connected School” launched in 2022 aims to complete the public intervention already
underway, including the remaining 9,900 buildings which will be provided with 1 Gigabit/s
connectivity with relative technical assistance for five years.

To implement the Plan, on 28 January 2022 Infratel launched a new tender, with a total budget of over
184 million euros for the supply of ultra-broadband Internet connectivity services at schools in Italy,
including the supply and installation of the access network and management and maintenance services,
expiring on 11 April 2022.

The tender is divided into eight territorial lots and the same subject can be awarded up to a maximum
of four lots.

The provisional award of the tenders was communicated on 6 June 2022.

The overall amount awarded was approximately 166 million euros.

TIM won four of the eight lots comprising the regions of Piedmont, Liguria, Valle d’Aosta, Tuscany,
Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia, winning over 99 million euros.

On 20 September 2022, the Agreements relating to the individual lots won were signed between Infratel
and TIM.

**“Smaller islands” plan (0.06 billion euros)**

The “smaller islands” plan aims to provide adequate connectivity to 18 smaller islands currently without
fibre optic connections with the mainland. In particular, the islands will be equipped with optical
backhaul which will allow the development of ultra-broadband connectivity. The optical backhaul will
be accessible to all operators through Submarine Backhaul Access Points identified according to the
criterion of the shortest distance from the neutral delivery point (NDP), if present on the island, and
from the landing point of the submarine cable.

The overall budget is 60.5 million euros.

The measure will be implemented through direct intervention models. The new network will be fully
financed and owned by the State and will be managed by one or more operators, chosen on the basis of
a competitive, open, transparent and non-discriminatory selection process.


-----

The tender to identify the economic operators to be entrusted with the design, supply and installation
of submarine fibre optic cables for the construction of the “Minor Islands Plan” was launched on 18
November 2021 and ended on 22 December 2021. Since the tender was abandoned, Infratel resubmitted
it, with modifications, on 11 February 2022 with a deadline of 18 March 2022, and the tender was
assigned to the company Elettra TLC on 28 April 2022 for approximately 45 million euros.

**Ultra-broadband Vouchers Plan**

The objective of the Plan, launched on 5 May 2020 with a total allocation of more than 1 billion euros,
is to promote and incentivize the demand for ultra-broadband connectivity services (NGA and VHCN)
in all areas of the country, with the aim of increasing the number of households and businesses that use
digital services using high-speed networks of at least 30 Mbit/s.

**3.** **Vouchers for families**

_Phase 1_

A first phase of intervention was launched on 9 November 2020, with an allocation of 200 million
euros, in favour of families with an ISEE of less than 20,000 euros, who will receive a contribution of
500 euros (200 euros for connectivity and 300 euros for Tablets or PCs on loan for use), responded to
the need to deal with the effects of the health emergency in the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic
and to guarantee suitable connection services to give continuity to the school and work activities of
families. The first phase ended on 9 November 2021, one year after its start, as per the implementing
decree. This measure proved to offer little incentive: of the entire allocated amount of 200 million euros,
more than 93 million euros were not allocated. 210,000 bonuses were assigned against an availability
of 400,000.

_Phase 2_

On 27 April 2022, Infratel therefore launched a public consultation preparatory to the start of a second
phase of disbursement of vouchers for families.

The total resources allocated for the intervention amount to 407,470,769 euros.

The objective of the intervention is to promote and stimulate the demand for ultra-broadband
connectivity services (NGA and VHCN) in all areas of the country, with the aim of expanding the
number of families that use digital services using high-speed networks speed to at least 30 Mbit/s.

The consultation expired on 31 May 2022.

Approval of the measure by the European Commission is pending.

**4.** **Vouchers for businesses**

The incentive scheme for businesses, approved by the European Commission on 15 December 2021,
was launched on 1 March 2022 and aims to promote ultra-fast internet connectivity for businesses and
the digitization of the production system.

Net of the amount attributed to communication and support costs for the measure and the reimbursement
of direct and indirect costs associated with carrying out the activity, the amount earmarked for the
disbursement of vouchers is around 590 million euros.


-----

Businesses will be able to request a single voucher to guarantee an increase in connection speed, from
30 Mbit/s to over 1 Gigabit/s ranging from a minimum of 300 euros to a maximum of 2,500 euros,
depending on the guaranteed download speed and the duration of the contract.

The Voucher Plan for businesses, initially scheduled to expire in December 2022, was extended until
31 December 2023, subject to the exhaustion of the allocated resources, following the decision of the
European Commission of 6 December 2022.

**Emergency in Ukraine**

In light of the Italian Government’s declaration of a state of emergency, approved by the Council of
Ministers on 28 February 2022, aimed at ensuring, until 31 December 2022, relief and assistance to the
Ukrainian population on the national territory, TIM, like the other operators, has voluntarily launched
important solidarity initiatives in support, in particular, of customers of Ukrainian origin residing in
Italy, to allow them to communicate free of charge or at discounted prices with their family members
in Ukraine.

AGCom, similarly to what was done in the past for previous emergencies and, most recently, on the
occasion of the Covid-19 pandemic, has set up a technical discussion table with operators in order to
share information and discuss further initiatives that can be planned in the medium term in support of
the Ukrainian population.

Meanwhile, on 8 April 2022 TIM also signed a joint declaration with other EU and Ukrainian operators
to provide affordable or zero roaming services and international calls between the EU and Ukraine.
Joint declaration aims to create a more stable framework to help displaced Ukrainians across Europe
stay in touch with family and friends.

**SPECTRUM**

In October 2018, MISE’s auction for 5G frequencies was concluded. TIM was awarded the following
blocks:

- 2 x 10 MHz FDD in the 700 MHz band;

- 80 MHz TDD in the 3.6- 3.8 GHz band;

- 200 MHz in the 26.5-27.5 GHz band.

The slots in 3.6-3.8 GHz and 26.5-27.5 GHz bands are available from 1 January 2019 whilst the slots
in 700 MHz band are available from 1 July 2022 after the freeing of TV broadcasting service. All the
frequency rights of use will expire on 31 December 2037 and can be extended for up to an additional
eight years.

The total amount of TIM’s licence fee is 2,399.38 million euro, which has been paid in several
instalments over the years 2018-2022 as reported below.

-----

In April 2021 TIM paid about 240 million euro for the renewal for eight years, until the end of 2029, of
2x15MHz FDD spectrum rights of use in the 2100 MHz band, following a favourable opinion issued
by AGCom (Decision 338/20/CONS).

In May 2022, TIM paid about 5 million euro for the renewal for six and a half years, until the end of
2029, of 20 MHz spectrum rights of use in the 3.4 -3.6 GHz band, following a favourable opinion issued
by AGCom (Decision 66/22/CONS).

In July 2022, TIM paid about 9.68 million euro for the renewal for seven years, until the end of 2029,
of 2x112 MHz FDD spectrum rights of use in the 27.5 – 29. GHz band, following a favourable opinion
issued by AGCom (Decision 157/22/CONS).

**EXTENSION OF GOLDEN POWER TO 5G TECHNOLOGY SERVICES (DECREE-LAW 25**
**MARCH 2019, NO. 22 (THE DECREE 22))**

The Decree 22 classifies the development of 5G as a strategic activity concerning national defence and
security, requiring more stringent controls. They are subject to special powers, in particular:

(a) the stipulation of contracts or agreements concerning the purchase of goods or services related
to the design, construction, maintenance and management of networks relating to 5G services;

(b) the acquisition of highly technological components necessary for the realisation or
management; and

(c) the elements indicating the presence of vulnerability factors that could compromise the integrity
and security of the networks and data that pass through them.

In particular, the stipulation of contracts and the acquisition of high-intensity components from parties
outside the European Union entail an obligation to notify the presidency of the council of ministers in
order to allow the timely exercise of the power of veto.

Failure to comply with the notification requirement entails a pecuniary administrative sanction equal to
twice the value of the transaction, and in any case not less than 1 per cent of the turnover achieved in
the last financial year. In a subsequent decree of the presidency of the council of ministers the task of
identifying simplified notification and certification procedures is finally assigned.

In this regard, on 27 June 2019 the Italian government started a public consultation around the adoption
of the decree of the presidency of the council of ministers in order to gather contributions from interested
parties regarding the following issues:

(a) identification of the simplified notification methods that may be differentiated (e.g. based on
the activity carried out, on the services offered or on the type of infrastructure involved); and

(b) definition of simplified procedures and terms for the investigation in connection with specific
circumstances.

TIM submitted its contribution by the deadline (19 July 2019).

In the meanwhile, Italian law decree no. 64 was published on 11 July 2019 introducing further
amendments to the provisions of Italian law decree no. 21 of 15 March 2012 converted by Italian law
no. 56 of 11 May 2012 with amendments.

Specifically on the subject of 5G, the new decree introduces the obligation to notify the prime minister’s
office using full disclosure within ten days from the conclusion of a contract or agreement covering the


-----

purchase of goods or services relating to the design, building, maintenance and management of the 5G
networks or the acquisition of high technological intensity components functional for the aforesaid
building or management when executed with subjects outside of the European Union, in order to allow
any veto power to be exercised or the imposition of specific instructions or conditions.

The prime minister announces any veto or imposition of specific instructions or conditions within 45
days from the notification. Based on the legislation above, the council of ministers of 5 September 2019
opted for the exercise of special powers in relation to the TIM disclosure concerning commercial
agreements, reached before 26 March 2019, regarding equipment and communication systems
functional for the development of 5G technology. As expected, decree law no. 64/2019 was not
converted into law and so its effects lapsed. Furthermore, the Italian government adopted decree law
no. 105 of 21 September 2019, concerning the national cybersecurity perimeter; it introduces
amendments to the provisions of decree law no. 21 of 15 March 2012 converted by Italian law no. 56
of 11 May 2012 with amendments.

The new decree no. 105 has been converted into law no. 133 of 18 November 2019.

The decree law no. 23 of 8 April 2020 (adopted with modifications by law no.40 of 5 June 2020) made
a main change to the general golden power regulation: also with regard to the communications sector,
the obligation to notify the participation in the companies has been extended to any foreign entities,
including those belonging to the European Union, in cases where the purchase is of such significance
to determine the permanent establishment of the purchaser by reason of the assumption of control of
the company whose shareholding is being purchased.

The Government has adopted the decree law n. 21 of 2022, converted into law n. 51 of 2022, which
modifies the golden power discipline relating to 5G technology and the cloud.

Furthermore, the decree law n. 187 of 2022 (adopted by Law no. 10 of 1 February 2023) has introduced
economic measures to support companies subject to the golden power discipline. In particular, Law no.
10 of 1 February 2023 integrated the competences of AGCOM, introducing the power of identification
by the Authority of the technical standards of fibre-optic cables, which the winners of the tenders must
comply with.

**ANTITRUST ISSUES**

- **_Antitrust in Italy_**

° **_Legislation on competition_**

TIM is subject to Italian competition law, and namely the law of 10 October 1990 no. 287 (“Provisions
aiming at protecting competition and the market”) which set up the AGCM (“Antitrust Authority”).

The Antitrust Authority is responsible for:

(i) applying law 287/1990 and supervising: (a) restrictive agreements; (b) abuses of a dominant
position; and (c) concentrations of enterprises;

(ii) applying, whenever the necessary conditions are met, the relevant EU provisions (i.e., articles
101 and 102 of the TFEU);

(iii) applying legislative decree 6 September 2005 no. 206 concerning unfair commercial practices;
and

(iv) monitoring conflicts of interest in the case of individuals holding government positions.


-----

In addition, the Antitrust Authority may:

(i) adopt interim measures; and

(ii) enforce commitments binding upon the proposing parties in order to prevent identified
anticompetitive concerns closing the investigation without any finding of a violation.

° **_Pending proceedings before the Competition Authority on restrictive agreements,_**
**_abuses of a dominant position and unfair commercial practices_**

Regarding the pending proceedings, see the TIM Group Interim Financial Results at 30 September 2022
_TIM Group – Disputes and pending legal actions on pages 38-49 incorporated by reference in this_
Information Memorandum.

- **_Antitrust issues at the European level_**

° **_Legislation on competition_**

TIM is subject to the European competition law. European competition policy covers anticompetitive
agreements (art. 101 TFEU), abuse of dominance (Art. 102 of TFEU), mergers (provided that the annual
turnover of the combined businesses exceeds specified thresholds, according to council regulation (EC)
no 139/2004) and state aid (art. 107 of TFEU).

The EC is empowered by the TFEU to apply these rules and holds a number of investigative powers to
that end (e.g. inspection at business and non-business premises, written requests for information, etc.).
It may also impose fines on undertakings which infringe the EU antitrust rules. The main rules on
procedures on the implementation of the competition rules set forth in Art. 101 and 102 of the TFEU
are set out in Council Regulation (EC) 1/2003.

Since 1 May 2004 all National Competition Authorities have also been empowered to fully apply EU
antitrust rules (i.e. Art. 101 and 102 of the TFEU) in order to ensure that competition is not distorted or
restricted. National courts may also apply these provisions in order to protect the individual rights
conferred on citizens by the Treaty. State aid rules, on the contrary, can only be applied by the EC.

As part of the overall enforcement of EU competition law, the EC has also developed and implemented
a policy on the application of EU competition law to actions for damages before national courts. It also
cooperates with national courts in order to ensure the coherent application of the EU competition rules
within the Member States.

**TELECOMMUNICATION REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN BRAZIL**

TIM Group’s operations in Brazil are subject to the 1997 General Law on Telecommunications (Lei
_Geral de Telecomunicações — “LGT”), to a comprehensive regulatory framework for the provision of_
telecommunications services adopted by ANATEL, and also to a public policy established by Ministério
_das Comunicações (“MCom”)._

In June 2020, through provisional measure no 980/2020, Brazilian president, at the time, Jair Bolsonaro
decided to rearrange the ministeries and recreate the MCom that shall be responsible for the national
telecommunications policy. From 2016 to the first half of June 2020, Brazilian telecommunications
were subordinated to a specific structure part of the ministry of science, technology, innovations and
communications (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e das Comunicações), that still exists
without this administrative competence. After the 2022 Brazil presidential election, the elected
president Lula also maintained this division.


-----

ANATEL is responsible for the regulation and implementation of national policies in the matter of
telecommunications. It is a quasi-independent body (due to the relationship with MCom) enjoying
financial and operational autonomy and a wide range of functions and powers to ensure retail customers´
rights, quality of service, wholesale rules and competition to avoid concentration of services. The board
of directors has five members with a fixed term, who are selected and appointed by the president, and
submitted for approval by the senate.

ANATEL has the power to impose restrictions, limitations or conditions on concessions, permits or
authorisations. ANATEL has the authority to propose and issue legally binding regulations on
telecommunications service providers. The rules issued by ANATEL are subject to periodic updates.
Any proposed regulation by ANATEL is subject to a period of public consultation, which may include
public hearings, and can be challenged in Brazilian courts.

ANATEL privatised the former public monopolistic operators and progressively opened the market to
competition, in addition to promoting universal access to basic telecommunications fixed services
(voice only).

Regarding the operational activity of TIM Brasil, ANATEL developed regulations for mobile
communication services (Serviço Móvel Pessoal or “SMP”), fixed communications services (Serviço
_Telefonico Fixo Comutado or “STFC”) and data transmission and multimedia services (Serviço de_
_Comunicação Multimídia or “SCM”), among others._

In 2010 virtual mobile operators were allowed to enter the market upon commercial agreements with
the established operators. Over the years, Anatel has published several resolutions that impose
obligations on the telecommunications sector, among which the following can be highlighted: (i) PGMC
2012, whose goal is to encourage competition by creating interconnection obligations and the sharing
of infrastructure already installed by other operators. PGMC 2012 was amended by Resolution No.
694/2018, the New PGMC, and is now under revision by Anatel; (ii) Resolution No. 632/2014, which
approved the adoption of a single regulation for the telecommunications sector (Regulamento Geral de
_Direitos do Consumidor de Serviços de Telecomunicações), currently under revision by Anatel; (iii)_
Resolution No. 671/2016, which approved the regulation on the use and sharing of the radio frequency
spectrum, which are currently under revision; (iv) Resolution No. 693/2018 approved the new general
interconnection regulation and revoked the “Interconnection” framework set forth by Anatel in 2005;
(v) Resolution No. 695/2018, which approved the new public price methodology for the right to use
radio frequencies (or PPDUR) setting forth a two-part price calculation basis, one for renovation of
radio frequencies and the other for license acquisition.

In 2019, ANATEL published relevant regulations pertaining to spectrum, such as: (i) Resolution No
710/2019 which attributes the use of 2.3 GHz frequencies and approves the usage conditions of this
frequency; and (ii) Resolution No 711/2019 which regulates the use of 3.5 GHz frequencies, setting the
first milestone for 5G deployment.

Also in December 2019, Anatel approved the new Telecommunication Services Quality Regulation
(RQUAL), based on a responsive regulation. In this new model, quality is measured on the basis of
three main indicators – a Service Quality Index, a Perceived Quality Index and a User Complaints Index
– and operators are classified into five categories (A to E). Based on this regulation, Anatel will be able
to take measures according to specific cases, such as consumer compensation, the adoption of an action
plan or the adoption of precautionary measures to ensure quality standard improvements.

After a joint work by Anatel, operators and the Quality Assurance Support Authority (ESAQ) to define
the objectives, criteria and reference values of indicators, recently, at the end of November 2021,
Anatel’s board of directors formalized the reference documents that apply this regulation: the
Operational Manual and the Reference Values (entered into operational effectiveness in 1 March 2022).
It also resolved disclosure of official indexes, and the Quality Seal (inducing competition for quality)


-----

at the beginning of 2023, considering the results of the new monitored indicators in the second semester
of 2022.

In 2020, ANATEL published some important regulations such as: (i) Resolution No. 718/2020 which
amends the “Regulation on Restricted Radiation Radiocommunication Equipment” to include
femtocells as restricted radiation radio-communication equipment; (ii) Resolution No. 719/2020 which
approves the new General Licensing Regulation; (iii) Resolution No. 720/2020 which approves the
General Authorisations Regulation; (iv) Resolution No. 725/2020 which approves the universalisation
obligations according to the PGMU approved by Decree No. 9,619/2018; (v) Resolution No. 735/2020
which reduces regulatory barriers to IoT and M2M services; (vi) Resolution No. 736/2020 which
approves the Regulation on Conditions of Use of the 1.5 GHz band; and (vii) Resolution No. 740/2020
which approves the Cybersecurity Regulation applied to the telecommunications sector.

In 2021, ANATEL published important regulations such as: (i) Resolution No. 741/2021 which
approves the Regulation of Adaptation from STFC Concessions to Authorizations of the same service;
(ii) Resolution No. 742/2021 which amends Resolution No. 711/2019 and the Regulation on Conditions
of Use of the 3.5 GHz Band attached to it, as well as approving the Regulation on the Conditions of
Use of the 24.25 GHz to 27.90 GHz band; (iii) Resolution No. 743/2021 which changes the General
Plan of Authorizations for the SMP; (iv) Resolution No. 744/2021 which approves the “Regulation for
the Continuity of the Provision of Switched Fixed Telephone Service Intended for Use by the General
Public in the Public Regime” (“STFC”); and (v) Resolution No. 746/2021 which approves the
“Regulation on Regulatory Inspection; (vi) Resolution No. 747/2021 which approves the “Regulation
on TV White Spaces” and (vii) Resolution No. 748/2021 which approves the “General Regulation for
Satellites”.

In 2022, ANATEL published, amongst others, the Resolution No. 749/2022, which approved the
Telecommunications Services Numbering Regulation, the Resolution No. 757/2022, which approves a
new regulation setting forth the conditions for the use of radio frequencies. ANATEL also started the
process of regulatory simplification, with the publication of Resolution No. 752 and related public
consultations.

On 19 June 2020, the board of directors of TIM Brasil approved the execution of a Conduct Adjustment
Term (“TAC”) between ANATEL and TSA, after final deliberation by ANATEL in the eighth directing
council’s extraordinary meeting. The agreement covers sanctions in respect of a value of approximately
R$ 639 million, which will be closed due to commitments related to the quality and customer experience
improvements, evolution of the digital attendance channels, reduction of complaint rates, and increased
network infrastructure in more than 2,000 locations. This TAC was signed by TSA and ANATEL on
25 June 2020 and will be in force between July 2020 and June 2024.

In June 2022, TIM completed the second-year of the Conduct Adjustment Term n. 001/2020 (TAC)
entered into with Anatel, having carried out the activities started for the strict fulfilment of the targets.
In the second semester of 2022, the Objective Commitments, Internal Controls, Legal Impediment and
Additional Commitments received the certificates from the Agency related to the second-year target.
With the closing of the first TAC Year, the following commitments are certified by the Agency: Repair
Plan/FDD/Notifications; Numbering Resources; Interconnection improvements; Complaints Index;
IGQ; Legal Impediment; Internal controls; LTE 700MHz; 4G New; Backhaul; Backlog Licensing;
Coverage Commitments; Presencial Service; Digital Service; and Additional Commitments. TIM will
continue to fully implement the internal monitoring buttons through the quarterly report on the evolution
of the schedules by the Governance Office at the Meeting of the Board of Directors and the Board of
Directors. So far, TIM has been complying with the TAC implementation schedule without the need
for any additional obligation.

As a result of the acquisition of Oi Móvel, Anatel, in the scope of the prior consent, imposed the
following conditions through the Acórdão n.º 9/2022: (i) elimination, within 18 months, of overlapping


-----

authorizations; (ii) observance and maintenance of the universalization targets (Oi, TIM and
Telefônica); (iii) submission of the pending guarantees to the coverage commitments (SPEs); (iv)
presentation of the communication plan to consumers for the migration of the Oi customer base; (v)
maintenance and continuity of mobile services provided at the Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station –
EACF; (vi) submission of (a) a reference offer in the Relevant Market of National Roaming, adapting
its content destined to Small Service Providers (PPPs); (b) a reference offer for exploring the mobile
service through virtual networks; (c) voluntary commitment to effectively use the spectrum authorized
to Oi, which will remain in effect until the publication of the PGMC revision and within a period of 18
months.

CADE, on the other hand, in the scope of the ACC, imposed (i) the definition of an independent
monitoring trustee; (ii) the disinvestment of Base Stations (ERBs), that’s no longer valid, considering
the terms of the ACC; (iii) the public submission of (a) a Reference Offer in the Relevant Market of
National Roaming, adapting its content destined to Small Service Providers (PPPs); (b) a reference offer
for exploring the mobile service through virtual networks; (iv) the provision of radiofrequencies; (v)
the submission of (a) an industrial network exploration offer; (b) a radiofrequencies offer; and (c) a 900
MHz offer.

The radiofrequency provision plan presented to regulatory agencies indicates the proposal for effective
use of the radiofrequency bands acquired from Oi within a period of 24 (twenty-four) months from the
closing with ANATEL and within a period of 30 (thirty) months for CADE.

- **_5G Auction_**

In February 2020, the ministry of science, technology, innovations and communications published
ordinance No 418 with guidelines for the 5G auction, concerning radiofrequency bands of 700 MHz,
2.3 GHz, 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz, requiring ANATEL to define technical criteria for mobile operation on
3.5 GHz in order to avoid harm from a TVRO signal offered by satellite dishes in Band C. It also
established that the auction should consider coverage commitments to (i) mobile service on 4G
technology or higher to cities, small villages and isolated urban and rural areas with more than 600
habitants; (ii) mobile broadband on federal highways; and (iii) fibre to the city (FTTC) on
municipalities without this backhaul.

Also in February 2020, ANATEL issued the public consultation No 9 in order to discuss the draft of
the Public Notice for the 5G Auction. ANATEL proposes bidding for the 700 MHz, 2.3 GHz, 3.5 GHz
and 26 GHz bands and includes another 100 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band. It also foresees investment
commitments that will enable more infrastructure and a higher level of services to users, such as is
outlined in the structural plan for telecommunications networks (“PERT”).

Regarding the possible interference caused by 5G in the reception of open satellite TV, the approved
proposal addresses the solution through a model similar to that adopted for the 700 MHz band, with the
creation of a group coordinated by ANATEL and an independent third party to operationalise the
solution.

In February 2021, ANATEL’s board of directors approved the public notice for the 5G Auction. After
that, there was an evaluation by the Brazilian federal court of auditors (“TCU”), that was completed on
25 August 2021. The auction was to Anatel for analysis, which approved the Notice on 24 September
2021. The auction was expected to be held in the second half of 2021, and occurred in November 2021.
TIM acquired 11 lots, with a total value offered of R$ 1.05 billion, in three frequency bands 3.5 GHz,
2.3 GHz and 26 GHz. The acquired bands have a set of obligations that must be met with financial
contributions or the construction of mobile and fixed network infrastructure. As a result, TIM
guarantees the necessary spectrum capacity to follow its growth journey in the mobile telephony market
nationwide, being prepared for its customers’ demands and to explore new applications and develop
innovative solutions that demand high-speed connectivity and capacity.


-----

Main commitments associated with each band:

- 2.3 GHz: 4G coverage in some municipalities and localities (South and Southeast Regions);

- 3.5 GHz: 5G coverage in all municipalities with a population equal to or greater than 30,000
inhabitants + fibre backhaul obligations in 138 municipalities + additional contributions to a
new entity (EAF) to carry out the following projects: clean-up 3.5 GHz, deployment of fibreoptic in the Amazon and building a private network for exclusive federal government use;

- 26 GHz: contributions to a new entity (EACE) to carry out connectivity school projects.

- **_Authorisations_**

ANATEL carried out the privatisation of the former public monopoly operator and gradually opened
the sector to competition, in addition to fostering universal access to basic telecom fixed services
(“STFC”). According to the general telecommunications law and to the regulations issued by
ANATEL, licenses to provide telecommunications services are granted either under the public regime,
by means of a concession or a permission, or under the private regime, by means of an authorisation.
Only certain fixed-line service providers are currently operating under the public regime (Telefónica,
Embratel, CTBC, Sercomtel and Oi, commonly referred to as “Concessionaires”). All the other
telecommunications services providers in Brazil are currently operating under the private regime,
including all the mobile and data service providers.

Since the launch of GSM mobile services in 2002, four main players operated in the mobile market
(Claro, Vivo, Oi and TIM) and compete nationwide. Third generation mobile services were introduced
in 2008 while fourth generation mobile services started in 2012.

The authorisations for fixed and mobile services give the TIM Group (which operates under the brand
name TIM Brasil) coverage of the entire country of Brazil, allowing it to provide fixed, mobile and long
distance voice, and also data services.

The rules require that all telecommunications services’ operators allow network access to any interested
party to provide value-added services, without discrimination, unless technically impossible. The voice
service providers can also provide value-added service through their own networks.

- **_Interconnection rules_**

Telecommunication operators were supposed to publish a public interconnection offer highlighting both
economic and technical conditions and were subject to the “General Interconnection Regulatory
Framework” enforced by ANATEL in 2005. In May 2012, ANATEL approved a new regulation which,
from January 2014, requires the application of the “Bill and Keep” system for local fixed termination
rates, _i.e., operators will take rights of tariffs generated on their networks, and no interconnection_
remuneration will be owed for local calls between two different networks.

Until 2016, the interconnection charges for fixed network (Tarifa de Uso da Rede Local) (“TU-RL”)
amount to a percentage of retail prices for the incumbent operators. Alternative operators with no
significant market power (including TIM) can apply asymmetrical interconnection rates exceeding by
up to 20% the one applied by the incumbents. As from 2016, the fixed interconnection rates have been
following a cost-oriented approach.

In July 2018, ANATEL approved the new General Interconnection Regulation which revoked the
“General Interconnection Regulatory Framework” enforced by ANATEL in 2005.


-----

The values of the mobile termination rate (called “Value to Use the Mobile network” or “VU-M”) are
freely negotiated by operators. ANATEL has, however, arbitration power in case of disagreement and
it can determine a reference value according to criterion set up by regulation. From January 2013, the
reference values set by ANATEL comply with a “glide path”, which led to cost orientated values
starting from 2016 to SMP operators. On 24 February 2017, considering the glide path provided in Act
No. 6,211/2014, VU-M were again reduced, depending on the Plano Geral de Autorizações do Serviço
_Móvel Pessoal (“PGA-SMP”) Region, to approximately 0.03 (three cents) Reais and, on 24 February_
2018, it was reduced to 0.01 (one cent) Reais.

In December 2018, ANATEL published corresponding Acts No. 9,918/2018 and No. 9,919/2018, which
determined the specific reference rates effective as of February 2020. Before coming into force,
ANATEL started revision of these acts and, on 24 February 2020, published new Acts No. 986/2020
and No. 987/2020 with new rates. VU-M reference values from 2024 are being also revised.

- **_General Competition Plan_**

In November 2012, ANATEL published the general plan for competition targets (the “PGMC”),
introducing tools for market analysis and identification of operators with market power and imposition
of ex-ante obligations.

The decision opens the networks of the operators with significant market power to unbundling and
wholesale broadband access. It also improves transparency measures through the creation of a
supervisory board to ensure the respect of the wholesale service quality levels.

In each market, ANATEL imposed a set of asymmetrical obligations to operators having significant
market power.

In the fixed access market, an access obligation on copper networks (e.g., leased lines, bitstream and
full unbundling) for the vertically integrated, fixed operators with significant market power (Oi,
Telefónica and Telmex) was introduced.

In July 2018, ANATEL published the new PGMC reviewing some of its points and set up new markets:
(i) mobile network; (ii) high capacity data transport; and (iii) national roaming. TIM Brasil has been
identified as having significant market power in the wholesale markets of mobile termination, national
roaming, and high capacity data transport (in five municipalities).

Due to such classification, TIM Brasil is subject to increased regulation under the PGMC, which could
have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and compliance with
regulations. The measures applied to a significant market power operator in those markets include:

- a glide path on mobile termination rates based on a price cap system and maintenance of partial
Bill & Keep until the next revision of PGMC;

- an obligation to offer the service of national roaming to operators not having significant market
power based on a price cap system; and

- an obligation to offer high capacity data transport based on a price cap system.

The PGMC is currently under review by Anatel and a new regulation is expected to come into force in
the first half of 2023.

° **Cost models’ implementation**


-----

In 2005, ANATEL issued a ruling for “Accounting Separation and Cost Accounting”. This ruling
introduced the obligation to present the accounting separation and allocation document (“Documento
_de Separação e Alocação de Contas”) (“DSAC”) for license holders and groups holding SMP in the_
fixed and/or mobile network interconnection and wholesale leased lines markets (“Exploração
_Industrial De Linha Dedicada”) (“EILD”). Operators, including TIM, have been providing ANATEL_
with the requested information since 2006 for fixed services and since 2008 for mobile services. In July
2014, ANATEL published the final decision regarding the costing models to set the wholesale reference
values for the fixed and mobile access and interconnection services, as well as the reference values for
the leased lines (Industrial Exploitation of the Dedicated Line) (“EILD”).

As from 2016, fixed termination rates (“FTRs” or “TU-RL”) and mobile termination rates (“MTRs”
or “VU-M”) are cost oriented to achieve the efficient cost level based on BU-LRIC model in 2019 and
for EILD in 2020.

As from new PGMC, all products (not only call termination rates and Leased Lines) are oriented by
costs.

Anatel published Public Consultation No 55/2021) on formulation of a new bottom-up cost model to
meet recent and future regulatory needs (new technologies like 5G and optic fibre networks).

° **Mobile interconnection rate glide path**

In November 2012, TIM Brasil, along with other national mobile operators Vivo, Claro and Oi, were
identified by ANATEL as having Significant Market Power in the wholesale mobile termination
market.

The remedies applied to significant market power mobile operators included a glide path on MTRs,
based on a price cap system.

In July 2014, ANATEL published a final decision regarding the cost model and the reference values of
the mobile termination rates that will apply from 2016 for SMP operators. For 2016, MTRs were set
with a Top Down methodology, until convergence to the BU-LRIC model is reached in 2019.

In addition to the MTR reduction, ANATEL established a bill and keep (“B&K”) ratio between
significant market power and non-significant market power PCSs. From January 2013 until February
2015, the B&K was 80%/20%. On 12 February, 2015, ANATEL approved, by means of Resolution
No. 649/2015, the following new B&K percentages, amending the percentages established by
Resolution 600: 75%/25% from 2015 until 2016; 65%/35% from 2016 until 2017; 55%/45% from 2017
until 2018; and 50%/50% from 2018 until 2019. As from the new PGMC, the partial B&K threshold to
50% (i.e., a non-SMP operator pays only if the terminated traffic on the SMP operator network is more
than 50% of the total traffic exchanged), will be applied until the next revision of PGMC scheduled to
start in 2022. In addition, ANATEL determined the end of the existing additional 20% on the value of
MTR, paid by SMP operators to non-SMP operators.

° **Lower fixed to mobile call prices for incumbent operators**

Under the Brazilian regulation, MTRs reductions must translate into reductions in retail fixed to mobile
call prices. Accordingly, ANATEL established new fixed to mobile retail call rates for fixed telephony
concessionaries, reflecting the lower mobile termination rates applicable starting on 25 February 2016.

° **Allocation of the 700 MHz band**

The auction for the allocation of the 700MHz band (698-806 MHz), the provision of the fourth
generation mobile services and high speed internet was held in September 2014.


-----

TIM Brasil, Claro and Vivo were granted three of the four auctioned national blocks of 10 + 10 MHz.
TIM Brasil offered 1,947 million Reais. The auction also ordered the winning bidders to constitute an
entity responsible for the spectrum clean-up process. A total amount of 3.6 billion Reais is designated
for the completion of the process and TIM shall pay 1,199 million Reais.

The frequencies will be available in all Brazilian cities that could face interference in simultaneous TV
and long-term evolution (“LTE”) operations within nine months of the complete “switch-off” of
analogue television channels.

The initial forecast contemplated 5,570 cities with a switch-off in 2018; however, ministry ordinance
No. 3,493/2016 established that:

- approximately 1,500 cities can have an immediate LTE activation since the frequencies are
already free;

- approximately 2,700 cities only need analogue channel relocation (switch-off not necessary
now); and

- approximately 1,400 cities would have a switch-off by 2018.

Bid winners were required to cover the costs for the implementation of the measures to overcome any
spectrum interference and the expenses resulting from the reallocation of digital TV channels.

In December 2014, TIM acquired the 718-728 MHz and 773-783 MHz sub-bands with national
coverage; these authorisations are valid until 2029. These sub-bands were only partially available for
mobile operation because they remain in use by broadcasters and ANATEL’s approval required for
their usage is still pending. The mobile operations on those sub-bands could only begin after the
reallocation of broadcasting channels and the following approval by ANATEL and interference
mitigation.

From 2016 to 2019 the analog TV switch-off occurred in regions where it was necessary to clean up
the 700 MHz spectrum for LTE use. By September 2019, all municipalities were able to receive 4G
coverage on the 700 MHz band from TIM. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the entity created to ensure the
spectrum cleanup, called the “Entity for Administration of TV and RTV Channel Relocation and
Digitalization Process” (“EAD”), fulfilled the remaining auction obligations, concluding the relocations
of broadcasters and the provision of interference solutions in order to complete the switch-off process
and to make the spectrum fully available to mobile operators.

**Spectrum auction in the 1,800 MHz, 1,900 MHz, and 2,500 MHz bands**

On 19 April 2016, ANATEL’s auction Committee assigned the multi-band local spectrum (135 MHz
in the 1,800 MHz, 1,900 MHz, and 2,500 MHz bands, including 60 MHz of unpaired Time Division
Duplex spectrum) auctioned in December 2015 for mobile and fixed-wireless broadband services.

TIM was awarded Frequency Division Duplex (“FDD”) spectrum in the 2,500 MHz band enabling the
provision of 4G/LTE services in the metropolitan areas of Recife and Curitiba. Authorisation terms
were signed in July 2016 for 15 years, and can be renewed for an additional 15-year term.

TIM and other mobile operators (Vivo, Claro and Oi) have been eligible to bid for spectrum in the 1,800
MHz band since the publication of resolution No 703/2018, which set up a new cap for spectrum usage
limits.

° **“Marco Civil de Internet” and Brazilian Data Protection Law**


-----

Law no 12.965/2014 ( “Marco Civil Internet”), which went into effect in June 2014, constitutes a kind
of “Constitution” on the use of the Internet in Brazil.

Key topics covered in the new regulations include net neutrality, collection, use and storage of personal
data, confidentiality of communications, freedom of expression and the treatment of illegal, immoral or
offensive contents.

The Marco Civil has been elaborated upon by the issuance of a government decree of implementation
and enforcement (Decree no 8.771/2016). The ministry’s decree (issued on 11 May 2016) addresses
three main aspects:

- clarification of the scope and implementation of the net neutrality rules;

- implementation of the rights and obligations for the protection of personal data; and

- governance of the Marco Civil, including authorities in charge of its enforcement.

The decree went into effect on 10 June 2016.

On 14 August 2018, the Brazilian President promulgated the General Data Protection Law (Law
No. 13709/2018). The new law is closer to the GDPR, including significant extraterritorial application
and expressive fines of up to 2% of the Issuer’s gross revenue per infraction, considering the previous
financial year.

In December 2018, provisional measure No. 869/2018 amended Law No. 13,709 to suit its application
into specific situations and to create the National Data Protection Authority (“ANPD”), within the
structure of the presidency of the republic, which implied a greater degree of control by the State. The
provisional measure also extended for 24 months the term of the law, that due to legislative issues, came
into force on 18 September 2020 by which date all legal entities should be required to adapt their data
processing activities to the new rules.

In July 2019, provisional measure No. 869/2018 was converted into Law No. 13,853, keeping the
ANPD as a federal public administration body linked to the presidency of republic, part of the executive
branch.

In June 2020, the bill of Law No. 1,179/2020 was converted into Law No. 14,010/2020 that postponed
the effective date of the provisions of the General Data Protection Law relating to fines and penalties,
to August 2021. As mentioned, the other provisions of the law took effect as from September 2020.
Additionally, the Decree No. 10,474/2020 was published in August 2020, approving the Regimental
Structure and the Demonstrative Chart of Commission Positions and Functions of Trust of the ANPD
which is responsible, among other things, for developing guidelines for the national policy for privacy
and data protection; supervising companies and applying sanctions; and issuing regulations and
procedures on personal data protection.

In June 2022, provisional measure No. 1,124 amended Law No. 14,460 to transform the ANPD into a
special nature federal autarchy, an entity of the indirect federal public administration. This status grants
full administrative and budgetary autonomy to the authority, which previously had only technical and
decision-making autonomy.

In October 2022, provisional measure No. 1,124 was converted into Law No. 14,460, keeping the
ANPD as a special nature federal autarchy, part of the indirect federal public administration, still part
of the executive branch.

° **Review of the current regulatory model for the provision of telecom services**


-----

In 2019, PLC 79/2016 was approved and converted into Law No. 13,879. The Law entered into force
on 4 October, establishing a new regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector in Brazil, the
biggest regulatory change in 20 years.

The new telecommunications framework allows the fixed telephone concessionaires to adapt their
agreements from a concession regime to an authorization regime. This change of concession to
authorization must be requested by the concessionaire and should be approved by Anatel. In return,
concessionaires must, among other conditions, make investment commitments to expand fixed
broadband services, in areas without adequate competition for these services, in order to minimize gaps
and inequalities among Brazilian areas. Additionally, it also changes the rules on authorization of
radiofrequency uses, establishing subsequent renewals and allows Radiofrequency trading among
players (spectrum secondary market).

In June 2020, the Federal Government published Decree No. 10,402/2020 which regulates Law No
13,879/2019 and provides for the adaptation of the concession instrument to authorization of
telecommunications services and on the extension and transfer of radiofrequency authorization, grants
of telecommunications services and satellite exploration rights.

Decree No. 10,402/2020 establishes that the partial or full transfer of the authorization to use radio
frequencies between telecommunications service providers will be carried out against payment by
Anatel and must be preceded by Anatel’s consent, in addition to enabling the maintenance of obligations
associated with radiofrequencies (serving the public interest), the application of restrictions of a
competitive nature when necessary/convenient and the analysis of tax regularity of the company to
which the authorization is being transferred. It also confirmed that the current authorizations are covered
by the new rule for successive renewals.

Additionally, decree No 9,612/2018 (the “Connectivity Plan Decree”) entered into force in 2018 which
updates and consolidates, in a single instrument, the public policies for the telecommunications in
Brazil. The Connectivity Plan Decree establishes a series of guidelines for execution of terms of conduct
adjustment, onerous granting of spectrum authorisation and regulatory acts in general which includes:
(i) expansion of high-capacity telecommunications transport networks; (ii) increased coverage of
mobile broadband access networks; and (iii) broadening the coverage of the fixed broadband access
network in areas with no internet access offer through this type of infrastructure. It also establishes that
the network implemented from the commitments will be subject to sharing from its entry into operation,
except when there is appropriate competition in the respective relevant market.

The Connectivity Plan Decree repealed Decree No. 4,733/2003, which provided for public
telecommunications policies, Decree No. 7,175/2010, which established the National Broadband Plan
(PNBL), and decree No. 8.776/2016, which created the Brazil intelligent program, a new stage of
expansion of the PNBL with actions to universalise access to the Internet and increase the average speed
of fixed broadband in the country.

In 2019, the decree No. 9,854/2019, the National Plan for Internet of Things (“IoT”) was published in
order to regulate and encourage this environment in Brazil. It refers to IoT as “the infrastructure that
integrates the provision of value-added services with physical or virtual connection capabilities of
things with devices based on existing information and communication technologies and their evolution,
with interoperability”. The Decree states that the following subjects are required to further support the
National Plan for Internet of Things: “(i) science, technology and innovation; (ii) international insertion;
(iii) vocational education and training; (iv) connectivity and interoperability infrastructure; (v)
regulation, security and privacy; and (vi) economic viability”.

In order to develop an IoT environment in the country, law 14,108/2020 was sanctioned exempting
FISTEL for five years (an administrative tax collected by ANATEL) from the base stations and
equipment that integrate the machine to machine (“M2M”) ecosystems and, also, extinguishes the prior


-----

licensing. The definition and regulation of M2M communication systems shall be established by
ANATEL.

In order to use the Universal Telecom Services Fund (“FUST”), (i.e. the contribution that the telecom
sector makes annually), in December 2020, Law No. 14,109 (later modified by Law No. 14,173/2021)
was sanctioned with the purpose of stimulating the use of FUST to expand and improve the quality of
telecommunications services, reducing regional inequalities and encouraging the use of new
technologies to promote economic and social development. In the case of using Fust’s resources, the
mentioned law envisages connecting all public schools by 2024 with broadband internet access. It also
provided for a 50% reduction in the payment of the mandatory annual contribution of
telecommunications operators to the Fund when they execute programs, projects, plans, activities,
initiatives, and actions approved by the Fund’s Management Council through the use of own resources.
So, this benefit loses currency in December 2026, but it can be renewed.
In the first quarter of 2022, the Federal Government signed Decree No. 11,004/2022, which regulates
the use of Fust and establishes guidelines for the use of resources by the Management Board, instituted
in 2022. The forecast is for approval of projects to be financed with FUST resources in early 2023.

In 2021 some important ordinances were published, namely: (i) Ministry of Communications Decree
No. 2,447/2021 that approved TIM’s issuance of up to R$5.753 billion in debentures, (ii) Ministry of
Communications Decree No. 2,556 that sets priorities and goals for the establishment of investments
determined by Anatel, (iii) Decree No. 10,748 that establishes the Federal Network for the Management
of Cyber Incidents, regulating the National Information Security Policy, which aims to improve and
coordinate the bodies and entities of the federal public administration in the prevention, treatment and
response to cyber incidents, (iv) Decree No. 10,887 which provides for the organization of the National
Consumer Defense System, with the objective of guaranteeing greater protection for consumer
relations, increasing legal certainty, and making the administrative process more efficient, and (v) Data
Protection Authority Decree No. 15 that creates the Governance Committee, responsible for
establishing institutional strategies and strategic guidelines related to public governance.

Also, there were some relevant regulations involving 5G. These were: (i) Decree No. 10,799 which
updates Decree No. 9,612/2018 (telecom public policies), allowing the Government’s network to be
built by other entities, not only Telebras; (ii) Decree No. 10,800 establishing Amazon Integrated and
Sustainable Program (PAIS). One of its objectives is to expand telecom networks to the Amazon region,
in addition to creating a management committee to monitor them, among other provisions; and (iii)
Ministry of Communications Decree No. 1,924/21 about 5G guidelines regarding, inter alia, network
security, obligation to provide an exclusive government network, backhaul for agribusiness coverage
of federal highways aligned with the Ministry of Infrastructure.

In 2022, the following ordinances have been issued which are worth noting: (i) Decree No. 10,952
which regulates Law 14,172/21 (transfer of R$ 3.5 billion for connectivity of public basic education
students and teachers). The decree determines that the resources may be used in a fixed connection,
provided that cost-effectiveness is proven or that there is no offer of mobile data in the location where
the beneficiary students live; (ii) Decree n. 10,996 which updates the digital government strategy for
the period from 2020 to 2022. The decree changes the deadline for digital transformation initiatives of
the bodies, in order to carry out more actions in the established time frame; (iii) Decree No. 11,034,
which brings new specifications to the SAC (Serviço de Atendimento ao Consumidor). Among the
alterations, it is worth mentioning the inclusion of assistance through other channels; the withdrawal of
the obligation to inform the protocol at the beginning of the service; the increase in the deadline for
responding to consumer demands, from five to seven days; and (iv) Decree No. 11,260 which provides
for the preparation and forwarding of the National Digital Government Strategy and extends the validity
of the current version to 2023.

**_Board of Statutory Auditors_**

On 31 March 2021, TIM Shareholders’ Meeting, based on the slates submitted by the Shareholders,
appointed a Board of Statutory Auditors, which will remain in office until the approval of 2023 financial
statements, composed of five Acting Auditors and four Alternate Auditors. The Shareholders Meeting
also appointed Statutory Auditor Francesco Fallacara as Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors.

The Board of Directors of 15 March 2023 confirmed Statutory Auditor Anna Doro as member of TIM
Supervisory Body pursuant to legislative decree 231/2001.

As of the date of this Information Memorandum, the Board of Statutory Auditors of TIM is composed
of the following Auditors:

**Name** **Position** **Appointment year**
Francesco FALLACARA (1) Chairman 2021
Angelo Rocco BONISSONI Acting Auditor 2021
Francesca di DONATO Acting Auditor 2021
Anna DORO (1) Acting Auditor 2021
Massimo GAMBINI Acting Auditor 2021
Ilaria Antonella BELLUCO Alternate Auditor 2021
Laura FIORDELISI (1) Alternate Auditor 2021
Franco Maurizio LAGRO Alternate Auditor 2021
Paolo PRANDI (1) Alternate Auditor 2021

(1) Elected by minority shareholders.

Under Italian Law, the Board of Statutory Auditors verifies compliance with the law and the Bylaws
and verifies adherence to the best administration principles, the adequacy and reliability of corporate
structures, internal audit procedures and accounting system, and the adequacy of instructions given by
TIM to its subsidiaries. The Board of Statutory Auditors must receive timely disclosures, at least
quarterly, from the Board of Directors about TIM’s business and significant transactions performed by
TIM and its subsidiaries, including related parties’ transactions. Statutory Auditors must inform
CONSOB of any irregularity they detect in the course of their duties and are required to attend
Shareholders and Board of Directors meetings.

**Potential Conflicts of Interest**

Some of the Directors and Statutory Auditors of TIM, in addition to their functions in TIM, hold
management and/or supervisory functions in other companies and/or institutions. Consequently, it
cannot be excluded that potential conflicts of interests may arise in the future, should any of these
companies and/or institutions enter into commercial or other types of transactions with TIM. The issue
of conflicts of interest is regulated, inter alia, by the Procedure for performing transactions with related
parties and by the Regulation of the Board of Directors, published on TIM’s website (respectively, at
[TIM Group | Other Codes and Procedures (gruppotim.it) and TIM Group | Regulations (gruppotim.it)).](https://www.gruppotim.it/en/group/governance/governance-tools/other-codes-procedures.html)

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following contains a summary of the terms of the TIM Group’s key items of indebtedness. It does_
_not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents. Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this section shall, unless the context_
_otherwise requires, have the same meanings set out in the underlying debt documents, as applicable._

**_Revolving Credit Facility_**

The following table shows committed (*) revolving credit lines available at 31 December 2022:

(euro billions) 31.12.2022 31.12.2021
Agreed Drawn down Agreed Drawn down
Sustainability-linked RCF – May 2026 4.0 — 4.0 —
Total

(*) Under the sustainability linked revolving credit facility agreement (the “RCF”), originally entered
into by TIM, as borrower, on 16 January 2018, as amended and restated pursuant to an amendment and
restatement agreement dated 13 May 2021, the lenders thereto are committed to provide funds at request
of TIM (with at least 3 days notice). Being a committed facility, the lenders must release the requested
funds unless a market standard mandatory cancellation provision has been triggered (i.e. Change of
Control, Borrower Illegality or Events of Default (each as defined in the RCF)).

The RCF does not contain any financial covenants (e.g. Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA/interest ratios, etc.),
failure to comply with which would entail an obligation to repay the RCF.

The RCF contains other market standard covenants, such as the undertaking not to materially change
the nature of TIM’s business. Amongst others, TIM has also agreed not to create or permit to subsist
any encumbrance (other than those permitted under the RCF) over its assets.

Furthermore, under the RCF, TIM undertakes not to merge or consolidate with any entity outside the
TIM Group, except in the circumstances expressly provided for therein.

**_Term Loans_**

At 31 December 2022, TIM, as borrower, has entered into bilateral and syndicated term loans
(collectively, the “Term Loans” and each a “Term Loan”) for 2,950 million euros with various bank
counterparties.

The loan agreements in respect of the Term Loan (the “Term Loan Agreements”) do not contain any
financial covenants (e.g. Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA/interest ratios, etc.), failure to comply with which
would entail an obligation to repay the relevant Term Loan, with the exception of the loan signed on 6
July 2022, which is backed by the “Italy Guarantee” issued by SACE in accordance with art. 1,
subsection 1 of Italian Decree-Law no. 23 of 8 April 2020, as subsequently amended and supplemented.

The Term Loan Agreements include other market standard covenants, including the undertaking not to
pledge TIM’s assets as collateral for loans (negative pledge) and the undertaking not to change the
business purpose or sell TIM’s assets unless specific conditions exist (e.g. the sale takes place at fair
market value).

Under the Term Loan Agreements, TIM is required to provide notification to the lenders if a change of
control event occurs. Identification of the occurrence of a change of control and the applicable
consequences – including, at the discretion of the lenders, the establishment of guarantees or the early

|Agreed|Drawn down|Agreed|Drawn down|

|Total||||


-----

repayment of the amount paid in cash or as shares and the cancellation of the commitment in the absence
of agreements to the contrary – are specifically covered in the individual Term Loan Agreements.

In addition, the outstanding loans generally contain a commitment by TIM, the breach of which is an
event of default, not to implement mergers, demergers or transfers of businesses, involving entities
outside the Group and in presence of certain other conditions. Such an event of default may entail, upon
request of the lenders, the early redemption of the drawn amounts and/or the annulment of undrawn
commitments under the relevant Term Loan Agreement.

The documentation of the Term Loans granted to certain companies of the TIM Group generally
contain, instead, obligations to comply with certain financial ratios, as well as certain other market
standard covenants, the breach of which gives lenders a right to request the early repayment of the
relevant Term Loan. In this respect, on 23 December 2021, the subsidiary FiberCop S.p.A. signed a
new 5-year Term Loan for an amount of 1.5 billion euros with a pool of international banks, which has
been fully drawn down.

**_EIB Loans_**

At 31 December 2022 the nominal total of outstanding loans (the “EIB Loans”) entered into by and
among TIM, as borrower, and the European Investment Bank (“EIB”), as lender, was 700 million euros,
all drawn down and not backed by bank guarantees.

The two EIB Loans – signed (i) on 25 November 2019 for an initial amount of 350 million euros
(extended for an additional amount of 120 million euros on 19 May 2021) and (ii) on 19 May 2021 for
an amount of 230 million euros – contain the following covenants:

- in the event TIM becomes the target of a merger, demerger or conferral of a business segment
outside the TIM Group, or sells, disposes of or transfers assets or business segments (except in
certain cases, expressly provided for), it shall immediately inform the EIB which shall have the
right to ask for guarantees to be provided or changes to be made to the relevant loan agreement,
or, only for certain loan agreements, the EIB shall have the option to demand the immediate
repayment of the relevant loan (should the merger, demerger or contribution of a business
segment outside the TIM Group compromise the Project (as defined in the relevant loan
agreement) execution or cause a prejudice to EIB in its capacity as creditor);

- TIM undertook to ensure that, for the entire duration of the loan, the total financial debt of TIM
Group companies other than TIM – except for the cases when that debt is fully and irrevocably
secured by TIM – is lower than 35% (thirty-five percent) of the TIM Group’s total financial
debt;

- “Inclusion clause”, under which, in the event TIM undertakes to comply with financial
covenants in other loan contracts (and even more restrictive clauses, including, for instance,
cross default clauses and commitments restricting the sale of goods) that are not present in or
are stricter than those granted to the EIB, the EIB will have the right – if, in its reasonable
opinion, it considers that such changes may have a negative impact on TIM’s financial capacity
– to request the provision of guarantees or an amendment of the loan contract in order to
establish an equivalent provision in favour of the EIB;

- “Network Event”, under which, in the event of the disposal of the entire fixed network or of a
substantial part of it (in any case, more than half in quantitative terms) to third parties not
controlled by the Company, or in the event of disposal of the controlling interest in the company
in which the fixed network or a substantial part of it has previously been transferred, TIM must
immediately inform the EIB, which may then opt to demand collateral or an amendment of the
loan agreement or choose an alternative solution.

(1) Net of buy-backs totaling 366 million euros made by the company in 2015.

The repayments, net of the TIM Group’s bonds buybacks, related to the bonds maturing in the following
18 months as of 31 December 2022 issued by TIM, Telecom Italia Finance S.A. and Telecom Italia
Capital S.A. (fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TIM S.p.A.) have the following details:

- 1,000 million euros, due 16 January 2023;

- 375 million pound sterling, due 19 May 2023;

- 1,000 million euros, due 19 July 2023;

- 750 million euros, due 19 January 2024;

- 1,250 million euros, due 11 April 2024;

- 1,500 million US dollars, due 30 May 2024.

On 20 January 2023, TIM S.p.A. successfully placed the Original Notes, subsequently issued on 27
January 2023.

Bonds issued by TIM, Telecom Italia Finance S.A. and Telecom Italia Capital S.A do not contain
financial covenants (e.g. ratios such as Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA/Interest, etc.) or clauses the breach of
which will result in the automatic early redemption of the bonds. Furthermore, the repayment of the
bonds and the payment of interest are not covered by specific guarantees nor are there commitments
provided relative to the assumption of future guarantees, except for the full and unconditional
guarantees provided by TIM for the bonds issued by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. and Telecom Italia
Capital S.A.

Since the bonds were placed principally with institutional investors in major world capital markets
(Euromarkets and the U.S.A.), the terms which regulate the bonds are in line with market practice for
similar transactions carried out on these same markets.

Finally, as at 31 December 2022, no covenant, negative pledge or other covenants under the TIM
Group’s outstanding financings had been breached or violated.

2023 (the “Original Agency Agreement”), as supplemented by a Supplemental Agency Agreement

specified office of each of the Paying Agents or (ii) may be provided by email to a Noteholder or
Couponholder following their prior written request to the Trustee, any Paying Agents or the Issuer
therefor and provision of proof of holding and identity (in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the relevant
Paying Agent or the Issuer, as the case may be). The Noteholders and the Couponholders are entitled
to the benefit of, are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed
and all the provisions of the Agency Agreement applicable to them.

**1.** **Form, Denomination and Title**

**1.1** **Form and Denomination**

The Notes are in bearer form, serially numbered, in the denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof up to and including €199,000. No Notes in definitive form
will be issued with a denomination above €199,000. Each Note will be issued with Coupons
attached on issue. Notes of one denomination may not be exchanged for another denomination.

**1.2** **Title**

Title to the Notes and to the Coupons will pass by delivery.

Notes shall not be physically delivered in Belgium except to a clearing system, a depositary or
other institution for the purpose of their immobilisation in accordance with article 4 of the

The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee will (except as otherwise required by law) deem
and treat the bearer of any Note or Coupon as the absolute owner for all purposes (whether or
not the Note or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or
writing on the Note or Coupon or any notice of previous loss or theft of the Note or Coupon)
and shall not be required to obtain any proof thereof or as to the identity of such bearer.

**2.** **Status**

The Notes and the Coupons relating to them are unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured
obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu among themselves and (save as aforesaid and for
certain obligations required to be preferred by law) equally with all other unsecured obligations
(other than subordinated obligations, if any) of the Issuer, from time to time outstanding.

**3.** **Covenants**

**3.1** **Restrictions on Security Interests**

The Issuer shall not create or permit to subsist any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance) over all or any of the present or future revenues or assets of (i) the Issuer or (ii)
any Subsidiary, provided that paragraph (ii) shall apply only to Financial Indebtedness of any
Subsidiary where such Financial Indebtedness is secured by, or benefits from, any such
Encumbrance and is also guaranteed by the Issuer under a Guarantee.

For the avoidance of doubt in respect of asset-backed financing (either by way of a
securitisation or otherwise) whereby the relevant assets are originated by the Issuer, the
expression assets does not include assets which, pursuant to the requirements of law and
accounting principles generally accepted in the Republic of Italy or in the country of
incorporation, as the case may be, currently need not be, and are not, reflected in the balance
sheet of the Issuer.

In these Conditions:

“affiliate” means, in relation to any Person, a subsidiary of that Person or a holding company
of that Person or any other subsidiary of that holding company.

“Control” of a company or corporation shall be construed as the power (whether by way of
ownership of shares, proxy, contract or other binding arrangement) to:

might be cast at a general meeting of that company or corporation; or

Indebtedness under hedging transactions entered into for the purpose of managing risks
arising under funded debt obligations such as credit support annexes and agreements;

Indebtedness under a Permitted Leasing Transaction provided that the aggregate

other amounts paid to a non-Italian resident legal entity or a non-Italian resident

Event of Default has occurred and is outstanding.

**4.** **Interest**

**4.1** **Interest Rate and Interest Payment Dates**

The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from and including 27 January
2023 at the rate of 6.875 per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear on 15 February
and 15 August in each year (each an “Interest Payment Date”). The first payment (for the
period from and including the Issue Date to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date, being
15 August 2023, and amounting to € 37.92 per €1,000 principal amount of Notes) shall be made
on 15 August 2023.

**4.2** **Interest Accrual**

Each Note will cease to bear interest from and including its due date for redemption unless,
upon due presentation, payment of the principal in respect of the Note is improperly withheld
or refused or unless default is otherwise made in respect of payment. In such event interest will
continue to accrue as provided in the Trust Deed.

**4.3** **Calculation of Broken Interest**

When interest is required to be calculated in respect of a period of less than six months, it shall
be calculated by applying the rate of 6.875 per cent. per annum to each €1,000 principal amount
of Notes (the “Calculation Amount”) and on the basis of (a) the actual number of days in the
period from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue (the “Accrual Date”)
to but excluding the date on which it falls due divided by (b) the actual number of days from
and including the Accrual Date to but excluding the next following Interest Payment Date
multiplied by two. The resultant figure shall be rounded to the nearest cent, half a cent being
rounded upwards. The interest payable in respect of a Note shall be the product of such rounded
figure and the amount by which the Calculation Amount is multiplied to reach the denomination
of the relevant Note, without any further rounding.


-----

**5.** **Payments**

**5.1** **Payments in Respect of Notes**

Payments of principal, premium and interest in respect of each Note will be made against
presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the Note,
except that payments of interest due on an Interest Payment Date will be made against
presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relevant
Coupon, in each case at the specified office outside the United States of any of the Paying
Agents.

**5.2** **Method of Payment**

Payments will be made by credit or transfer to a euro account (or any other account to which
euro may be credited or transferred) specified by the payee and maintained with a bank in a city
in which banks have access to the TARGET System.

For the purposes of these Conditions, “TARGET System” means the Trans European
Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET 2) System.

**5.3** **Missing Unmatured Coupons**

Each Note should be presented for payment together with all relative unmatured Coupons,
failing which the full amount of any relative missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of
payment not being made in full, that proportion of the full amount of the missing unmatured
Coupon which the amount so paid bears to the total amount due) will be deducted from the
amount due for payment. Each amount so deducted will be paid in the manner mentioned above
against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the
relative missing Coupon at any time before the expiry of 10 years after the Relevant Date (as
defined in Condition 7 (Taxation)) in respect of the relevant Note (whether or not the Coupon
would otherwise have become void pursuant to Condition 8 (Prescription)) or, if later, five

giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Trustee and the Principal Paying
Agent and, in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices), the Noteholders (which notice shall be

to pay additional amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 7 (Taxation) either:

(a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Relevant

by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it; or

(b) where a Person into which the Issuer is merged or to whom it has conveyed, transferred
or leased all or substantially all of its assets is required to pay additional amounts,
unless the sole purpose of such a merger would be to permit the Issuer to redeem the
Notes,

provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such additional amounts were a
payment in respect of the Notes then due.


-----

Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Condition, the Issuer shall
deliver to the Trustee (i) a certificate signed by a duly authorised representative of the Issuer
stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred, and
(ii) an opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that the Issuer
has or will become obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result of such change or
amendment and the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set out above, in which event they shall
be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

Notes redeemed pursuant to this Condition 6.2 will be redeemed at their principal amount
together with any interest accrued to (but excluding) the date of redemption.

**6.3** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Make-Whole Call)**

Redemption Amount together, if appropriate, with interest accrued to (but excluding) the
Optional Redemption Date.

For the purposes of this Condition 6.3, the “Optional Redemption Amount” will be an amount
which is the higher of:

(a) 101 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and

(b) as determined by the Reference Dealers (as defined below), the sum of the then current

selected in good faith by the Issuer)) most nearly equal to the period from the Optional
Redemption Date to the Maturity Date;

“Reference Dealers” shall be each of the four banks selected by the Issuer which are primary
European government security dealers, and their respective successors, or market makers in

the third business day in London preceding the Optional Redemption Date quoted in writing to
the Issuer by the Reference Dealers.

All Notes in respect of which any such notice is given under this Condition 6.3 shall be

(and including) the day that is 90 days prior to the Maturity Date to (but excluding) the Maturity
Date, at the Final Redemption Amount, together (if appropriate) with interest accrued but
unpaid to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption.

**6.5** **Redemption at the Option of the Holders on the Occurrence of a Change of Control and**
**Network Event**

If a Put Event occurs, each Noteholder shall have the option (a “Put Option”) to require the
Issuer to redeem (or, at the Issuer’s option, to purchase) the Notes held by it (in whole but not
in part) on the date (the “Put Date”) which is seven days after the expiration of the Put Period
(as defined below) at 101% of their principal amount together with interest accrued to (but
excluding) the date of redemption.

A “Put Event” will be deemed to occur either:

or persons referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and/or (c) of the definition of
“Acquisition of Control” below has or acquires such Control or Joint Control) (a
“Change of Control”); or

(b) upon the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
(including, without limitation, by way of de-merger, spin-off, dividend in kind or other
separation), in one or a series of related transactions (each a “Disposition”) of (i) all or
a substantial portion (constituting more than one-half in quantitative terms) of the
properties or assets comprised in the Network to a Person or Persons which are not a
Subsidiary or, as applicable, Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) shares of a Person or
Persons to which the Network, or a substantial portion thereof, was previously
transferred if such Disposition of shares results in the Issuer ceasing to have Control


-----

over any such Person or Persons; provided that, solely in respect of this sub-paragraph
(b), immediately after giving _pro forma effect to such Disposition (including any_
substantially concurrent application of the proceeds thereof) the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio of the Issuer exceeds 3.00 to 1.00 (any such Disposition, a “Network
**Event”).**

Promptly upon the Issuer becoming aware that a Put Event has occurred, the Issuer shall give
notice (a “Put Event Notice”) to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices)
specifying (i) that Noteholders are entitled to exercise the Put Option; (ii) all information
material to Noteholders in relation to the Change of Control or Network Event; and (iii) the
procedure for exercising the Put Option.

To exercise the Put Option, the holder of the Notes must deliver at the specified office of any
Paying Agent on any Business Day at the place of such specified office falling within the period
of 60 days following the date of the Put Event Notice (the “Put Period”), a duly signed and
completed notice of exercise in the form (for the time being current and which may, if this Note
is held through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) or Clearstream Banking, S.A.
(“Clearstream, Luxembourg”), be any form acceptable to Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg delivered in a manner acceptable to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg)
obtainable from any specified office of any Paying Agent (a “Put Notice”) and in which the
holder must specify a bank account to which payment is to be made under this paragraph
accompanied by such Notes and all Coupons appertaining thereto or evidence satisfactory to
the Paying Agent concerned that such Notes and all Coupons appertaining thereto will,
following the delivery of the Put Notice, be held to its order or under its control. A Put Notice
given by a holder of any Note shall be irrevocable except where, prior to the due date of
redemption, an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which event such holder, at
its option, may elect by notice to the Issuer to withdraw the Put Notice.

In this Condition:

the “Acquisition of Control” means, with respect to the Issuer, the acquisition, either by way
of public tender offer, private arrangement or otherwise, of Control of the Issuer by any third

Issuer; and/or

(b) the direct or indirect majority shareholder of, and/or any company or entity participated
in and controlled by, such shareholder as at the Issue Date; and/or

(c) any single shareholder or combination of shareholders referred to in subparagraph (a)
and/or (b) above (“Permitted Acquiring Shareholders”), also acting jointly with any
third parties provided that in such case the Permitted Acquiring Shareholders hold at
least Joint Control of the Issuer;

_provided that notwithstanding the foregoing a transaction will not be deemed to involve an_
Acquisition of Control solely as a result of the Issuer becoming a direct or indirect whollyowned subsidiary of a holding company if (x) the direct or indirect holders of the voting rights
exercisable in the ordinary shareholders meeting of such holding company immediately
following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of voting rights exercisable
in the ordinary shareholders meeting of the Issuer immediately prior to that transaction or (y)
immediately following that transaction no third party (other than a holding company satisfying
the requirements of this sentence) has Control of such holding company.

calculating Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for such period (and without duplication of any
adjustments already made in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA):

(a) if the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries has Incurred any Financial Indebtedness since
the beginning of such period that remains outstanding, Consolidated EBITDA and
Consolidated Net Indebtedness for such period shall be calculated, without duplication,
after giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Financial Indebtedness as if such
Financial Indebtedness had been Incurred on the first day of such period;

(b) if the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries has repaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased or

EBITDA for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated
EBITDA (if positive) directly attributable to the assets which are the subject of such
Sale for such period, or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if
negative) directly attributable thereto, for such period and the Consolidated Net
Indebtedness for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated
Net Indebtedness directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer or of
any Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to
the Issuer and the continuing Subsidiaries in connection with such Sale for such period
(or, if the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary is sold, the Consolidated Net Indebtedness
for such period directly attributable to the Financial Indebtedness of such Subsidiary to
the extent the Issuer and the continuing Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such
Financial Indebtedness after such Sale); provided that if any such Sale constitutes
“discontinued operations” or “non-current assets held for sale” in accordance with then


-----

applicable IFRS, Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall only be reduced or
increased to the extent such profit or loss increased or decreased, as applicable, the
Consolidated EBITDA for such period;

calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net
Indebtedness for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto
as if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period;

(e) any Person that is a Subsidiary (after giving pro forma effect to the transaction causing
a calculation to be made hereunder) on the relevant calculation date will be deemed to
have been a Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(f) any Person that is not a Subsidiary (after giving pro forma effect to the transaction
causing a calculation to be made hereunder) on the relevant calculation date will not be
deemed to have been a Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(g) if, since the beginning of such period, any Person (that subsequently became a
Subsidiary or was merged or otherwise combined with the Issuer or any Subsidiary
since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Sale or any Purchase that
would have required an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) above if made by
the Issuer or a Subsidiary during such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated
Net Indebtedness for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect
thereto as if such Sale or Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period.

premium and interest which would otherwise have been receivable in respect of the Notes or
Coupons, as the case may be, in the absence of such withholding or deduction, except that no
such additional amounts shall be payable:

(a) in respect of any Note or Coupon presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder

implementing regulations, each as amended and/or supplemented from time to time or
superseded.

For the avoidance of doubt, no additional amount shall be payable by the Issuer with respect to
any Note or Coupon for or on account of imposta sostitutiva if the holder becomes subject to
_imposta sostitutiva by reason of an amendment or supplement to or replacement of the list of_
countries which provide for a satisfactory exchange of information with the Republic of Italy,
according to Article 6 of Decree No. 239 and any related implementing regulations, each as
amended and/or supplemented from time to time or superseded; or

authority or making any other claim or filing, but fails to do so; or

(e) in respect of any Note or Coupon in the event of payment to a non Italian resident legal
entity or non Italian resident individual, to the extent that interest or other amounts are
paid to a non Italian resident legal entity or non Italian resident individual which is
resident in a country which does not allow for a satisfactory exchange of information
with the Republic of Italy.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions, any amounts to be paid on the Notes
and Coupons by or on behalf of the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding: (i)
imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code, or
otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations


-----

thereunder or any official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between
the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any fiscal
or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing such an intergovernmental agreement)
(any such withholding or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”); or (ii) imposed on a payment
by a Luxembourg paying agent to an individual resident in Luxembourg pursuant to the Law

other person will be required to pay additional amounts on account of any FATCA
Withholding.

As used herein:

(i) “Relevant Jurisdiction” means the Republic of Italy and/or such other taxing
jurisdiction to which the Issuer becomes subject by reason of its tax residence, or any
political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax; and

(ii) the “Relevant Date” means the date on which such payment first becomes due, except
that, if the full amount of the moneys payable has not been duly received by the Trustee

Condition 5 (Payments).

The Trustee at its discretion may, and if so requested in writing by the holders of at least onequarter in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding or if so directed by an Extraordinary
Resolution shall (subject in each case to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to
its satisfaction) (but only if, except in relation to paragraph 9(a) below, the Trustee shall have
certified in writing to the Issuer that such event is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial to the
interests of the Noteholders), give notice in writing to the Issuer that the Notes are, and the
Notes shall thereupon immediately become, due and repayable at their redemption amount
together with accrued interest as provided in the Trust Deed if any of the following events (each
an “Event of Default”) shall have occurred and be continuing:

(a) _Non-payment: default is made in the payment of any principal, premium or interest due_
in respect of the Notes or any of them and the default continues for a period of 10 days
in the case of principal and premium and 30 days in the case of interest; or

(b) _Breach of other obligations: the Issuer fails to perform or observe any of its other_
obligations under these Conditions or the Trust Deed and the failure continues for the
period of 60 days next following the service by the Trustee on the Issuer of notice
requiring the same to be remedied; or

(c) _Cross-default of Issuer:_

(i) any Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer in excess of €100,000,000 (or
the equivalent thereof in other currencies) has to be repaid prematurely due to
a default under its terms; or


-----

(ii) the Issuer fails to fulfil any payment obligation exceeding €100,000,000 (or
the equivalent thereof in other currencies) under any Capital Markets
Indebtedness, or under any guarantee provided for any such Capital Markets
Indebtedness in excess of €100,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in other
currencies) of others, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days; or

(iii) any security or guarantee relating to Capital Markets Indebtedness in excess of
€100,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in other currencies) provided by the
Issuer is enforced by the lenders and such enforcement is not contested in good
faith by the Issuer or the Issuer publicly announces its inability to meet its
financial obligations; or

(d) _Insolvency:_

(i) a court opens insolvency or equivalent proceedings against the Issuer which
are not resolved within six months, unless such proceedings are frivolous or
vexatious and contested in good faith and appropriately and do not result in
court orders or the Issuer applies for such insolvency or equivalent
proceedings; or

(ii) the Issuer approves a resolution pursuant to which it goes into liquidation
unless this is done in connection with a merger, or other form of combination
with another company and such company assumes all obligations contracted
by the Issuer, in connection with the Notes and the Trust Deed.

As used herein, “Capital Markets Indebtedness” means any obligation for the
payment of borrowed money which is in the form of, or represented or evidenced by,
a certificate of indebtedness or in the form of, or represented or evidenced by, bonds,
notes or other securities, in each case which is/are listed or traded on a stock exchange
or other recognised securities market.

**10.** **Enforcement**

The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings against
the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes and the
Coupons, but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation
to the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons unless (a) it shall have been so directed by an
Extraordinary Resolution or so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-quarter in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and (b) it shall have been indemnified and/or
pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction. No Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled
to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed
fails or is unable so to do within 90 days, and the failure or inability shall be continuing.

**11.** **Replacement of Notes and Coupons**

Should any Note or Coupon be lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced
at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent upon payment by the claimant of the
expenses incurred in connection with the replacement and on such terms as to evidence and
indemnity as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must
be surrendered before replacements will be issued.


-----

**12.** **Notices**

All notices regarding the Notes will be valid if published in a leading English language daily
newspaper published in London (which is expected to be the Financial Times) and, so long as
the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the listing rules of such exchange
so require, all notices to Noteholders shall be deemed to be duly given if they are published in
one daily newspaper in Luxembourg or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange:
_www.luxse.com. The Issuer shall also ensure that notices are duly published in a manner which_
complies with the rules and regulations of any other stock exchange or other relevant authority
on which the Notes are for the time being listed. Any such notice will be deemed to have been
given if published in a leading English language daily newspaper published in London, on the
date of the first publication or, where required to be published in more than one newspaper, on
the date of the first publication in all required newspapers.

**13.** **Substitution**

The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders, agree with the Issuer to the
substitution in place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this Condition 13) as the
principal debtor under the Notes, Coupons and the Trust Deed of another company, being any
entity that may succeed to, or to which the Issuer (or any previous substitute under this
Condition 13) may transfer, all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Issuer (or
any previous substitute under this Condition 13) by operation of law, contract or otherwise,
subject to (a) the Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be
materially prejudiced by the substitution and (b) certain other conditions set out in the Trust
Deed being complied with.

**14.** **Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver, Authorisation and Determination**

**14.1** **Meetings of Noteholders**

The Trust Deed contains provisions consistent with the laws, legislation, rules and regulations
of the Republic of Italy (including without limitation Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February
1998, as amended) for convening meetings of the Noteholders (which may be at a physical
location or by way of conference call or videoconference) to consider any matter affecting their
interests, including any modifications of the Conditions or of any provisions of the Trust Deed.
The above provisions are subject to compliance with mandatory laws, rules and regulations of
the Republic of Italy in force from time to time.

The quorum and the majorities for passing resolutions at any such meetings are established by
Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code, Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998 and the
Issuer’s by-laws.

Resolutions passed at any meeting of the Noteholders shall be binding on all Noteholders,
whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all Couponholders. In accordance with
the Italian Civil Code, a rappresentante comune, being a joint representative of Noteholders,
may be appointed in accordance with Article 2417 of the Italian Civil Code in order to represent
the Noteholders’ interest hereunder and to give execution to the resolutions of the meeting of
the Noteholders.

**14.2** **Waiver, Authorisation, Determination and Exercise by the Trustee of Discretions Etc.**

The Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to any
modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of
the provisions of the Notes or the Trust Deed, or determine, without any such consent as


-----

aforesaid, that any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed)
shall not be treated as such, where, in any such case, it is not, in the opinion of the Trustee,
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders so to do or may agree, without any
such consent as aforesaid, to any modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature
or to correct an error which is manifest or, in the opinion of the Trustee, proven.

In connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers, authorities and discretions
(including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or
substitution), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class
(but shall not have regard to any interests arising from circumstances particular to individual
Noteholders or Couponholders whatever their number) and, in particular but without limitation,
shall not have regard to the consequences of any such exercise for individual Noteholders or
Couponholders (whatever their number) resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled
or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular
territory or any political subdivision thereof and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor
shall any Noteholder or Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any
other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequences of any such
exercise upon individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the extent already provided
for in Condition 7 (Taxation) and/or any undertaking or covenant given in addition to, or in
substitution for, Condition 7 (Taxation) pursuant to the Trust Deed.

**14.3** **Notification to the Noteholders**

Any modification, abrogation, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution shall be
binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise,
shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance
with Condition 12 (Notices).

**15.** **Indemnification of the Trustee and Trustee Contracting with the Issuer**

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified to its
satisfaction.

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, inter alia,
(a) to enter into business transactions with the Issuer and/or any of its Subsidiaries and to act as
trustee for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer
and/or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations
and perform its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any
such trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or consequences for, the Noteholders or
Couponholders and (c) to retain and not be liable to account for any profit made or any other
amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**16.** **Further Issues**

The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders
create and issue further notes, having terms and conditions the same as those of the Notes, or
the same except for the amount and date of the first payment of interest, which may be
consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding Notes. Any further notes which are
to form a single series with the Notes shall be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust
Deed.


-----

**17.** **Governing Law and Submission to Jurisdiction**

**17.1** **Governing Law**

The Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons and any non-contractual obligations arising out of
or in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons are governed by, and
construed in accordance with, English law save for the mandatory provisions of Italian law
relating to the meetings of Noteholders and the Noteholders’ Representative.

**17.2** **Submission to Jurisdiction**

(a) English courts have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in
connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons), including any dispute as to
their existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination or the
consequences of their nullity and any dispute relating to any non-contractual
obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes or the
Coupons (a “Dispute”) and each of the Issuer, the Trustee and any Noteholders or
Couponholders in relation to any Dispute submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
English courts.

(b) For the purposes of this Condition, the Issuer waives any objection to the English courts
on the grounds that they are an inconvenient or inappropriate forum to settle any
Dispute.

**17.3** **Appointment of Process Agent**

The Issuer irrevocably appoints TI Sparkle UK Limited at 6 New Street Square, London, EC4A
3DJ as its agent for service of process in any proceedings before the English courts in relation
to any Dispute, and agrees that, in the event of TI Sparkle UK Limited being unable or unwilling
for any reason so to act, it will immediately appoint another person approved by the Trustee as
its agent for service of process in England in respect of any Dispute. The Issuer agrees that
failure by a process agent to notify it of any process will not invalidate service. Nothing herein
shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

**17.4** **Other Documents**

The Issuer has in the Agency Agreement and the Trust Deed submitted to the jurisdiction of
the English courts and appointed an agent in England for service of process, in terms
substantially similar to those set out above.

**18.** **Rights of Third Parties**

No rights are conferred on any person under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
to enforce any term of this Note, but this does not affect any right or remedy of any person
which exists or is available apart from that Act.


-----

**SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE FURTHER NOTES WHILE**
**REPRESENTED BY THE GLOBAL NOTES**

_The following is a summary of the provisions contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Further_
_Notes and in the Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Conditions of the_
_Further Notes while the Further Notes are represented by the Global Notes._

**1.** **Accountholders**

For so long as all of the Further Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such
Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person
(other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being shown in the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular principal amount
of such Further Notes (each an “Accountholder”) (in which regard any certificate or other
document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such
Further Notes standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount
of such Further Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any
quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Noteholders and
giving notice to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 6.5 (Redemption at the Option of the Holders
_on the Occurrence of a Change of Control and Network Event) other than with respect to the_
payment of principal, premium and interest on such principal amount of such Further Notes,
the right to which shall be vested, as against the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the bearer of
the relevant Global Note in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Trust
Deed. Each Accountholder must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the
case may be, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

**2.** **Payments**

On and after [●] May 2023, no payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless
exchange for an interest in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused.
Payments of principal, premium and interest in respect of Further Notes represented by a Global
Note will, subject as set out below, be made against presentation for endorsement and, if no
further payment falls to be made in respect of the Further Notes, against surrender of such
Global Note to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have
been notified to the Noteholders for such purposes. A record of each payment made will be
endorsed on the appropriate part of the schedule to the relevant Global Note by or on behalf of
the Principal Paying Agent, which endorsement shall be _prima facie evidence that such_
payment has been made in respect of the Further Notes. Payments of interest on the Temporary
Global Note (if permitted by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon
certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such certification has already been
made.

**3.** **Notices**

For so long as all of the Further Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such
Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to
Noteholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (as the case may be) for communication to the relevant Accountholders rather
than by publication as required by Condition 12 (Notices), provided that, so long as the Further
Notes are listed on any stock exchange, notices shall also be published in accordance with the
rules of such exchange. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders
on the day on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as
the case may be) as aforesaid.


-----

Whilst any of the Further Notes held by a Noteholder are represented by a Global Note, notices
to be given by such Noteholder may be given by such Noteholder (where applicable) through
the applicable clearing system’s operational procedures approved for this purpose and
otherwise in such manner as the Principal Paying Agent and the applicable clearing system may
approve for this purpose.

**4.** **Interest Calculation**

For so long as Further Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes, interest payable to
the bearer of a Global Note will be calculated by applying the rate of 6.875 per cent. per annum
to the principal amount of the Global Note and on the basis of (a) the actual number of days in
the period from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue (the “Accrual
**Date”) to but excluding the date on which it falls due divided by (b) the actual number of days**
from and including the Accrual Date to but excluding the next following Interest Payment Date
multiplied by two. The resultant figure shall be rounded to the nearest cent, half a cent being
rounded upwards.

**5.** **Exchange**

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the
holder) for definitive Further Notes only:

(a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Trust Deed as “Events of
Default”;

(b) the Issuer has been notified that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have
been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of
holiday, statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease
business or have in fact done so and no successor clearing system is available; or

(c) the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be
suffered were the Further Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed
by two authorised signatories of the Issuer is given to the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting
on the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee
may give notice to the Issuer and the Principal Paying Agent and (in the case of (c)) the Issuer
may give notice to the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent and the Noteholders, of its intention
to exchange the Permanent Global Note for definitive Further Notes. Any exchange shall occur
no later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the first relevant notice by the Principal Paying
Agent.

Exchanges will be made upon presentation of the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of
the Principal Paying Agent on any day on which banks are open for general business in London.
In exchange for the Permanent Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of,
an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Further Notes (having attached to them all
Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note),
security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and
in or substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange of the Permanent Global
Note, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the
holder together with any relevant definitive Further Notes.


-----

**6.** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Further Notes represented
by a Global Note will be prescribed after ten (10) years (in the case of principal) and five (5)
years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 7 (Taxation)).

**7.** **Cancellation**

Cancellation of any Further Note represented by a Global Note and required by the Conditions
of the Further Notes to be cancelled following its redemption or purchase will be effected by
endorsement by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent of the reduction in the principal
amount of the relevant Global Note on the relevant part of the schedule thereto.

**8.** **Put Option**

For so long as all of the Further Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such
Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, the option
of the Noteholders provided for in Condition 6.5 (Redemption at the Option of the Holders on
_the Occurrence of a Change of Control and Network Event) may be exercised by an_
Accountholder giving notice to the Principal Paying Agent in accordance with the standard
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (which may include notice being given
on his instructions by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary for
them to the Principal Paying Agent by electronic means) of the principal amount of the Further
Notes in respect of which such option is exercised and at the same time presenting or procuring
the presentation of the relevant Global Note to the Principal Paying Agent for notation
accordingly within the time limits set forth in that Condition.

**9.** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer**

For so long as all of the Further Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such
Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, no selection
of Further Notes to be redeemed will be required under Condition 6.7 (Provisions Relating to
_Partial Redemption) in the event that the Issuer exercises its call option pursuant to Condition_
6.6 (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Equity Offering)) in respect of less than the
aggregate principal amount of the Further Notes outstanding at such time. In such event, the
partial redemption will be effected in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (to be reflected in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion).

**10.** **Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg**

Further Notes represented by a Global Note are transferable in accordance with the rules and
procedures for the time being of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, as appropriate.

**11.** **Fungibility**

The Further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Original Notes on and
from the date on which, and to the extent that, interests in the Temporary Global Note are
exchanged for interests in the Permanent Global Note, as described above. The Conditions of
the Further Notes shall be construed accordingly.


-----

**TAXATION**

_The following overview contains a description of certain Italian, EU and Luxembourg tax consequences_
_in respect of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Further Notes. This overview is based on the_
_laws in force in Italy, the EU and Luxembourg as at the date of this Information Memorandum (as they_
_are currently applied by the relevant tax authorities) and is subject to any changes in such laws_
_occurring after such date, which changes could be made also on a retroactive basis._

_The following overview does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations_
_which may be relevant to a decision to subscribe for, purchase, own or dispose of the Further Notes_
_and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some_
_of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Further Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers concerning_
_the overall tax consequences of their ownership of the Further Notes._

**Italian taxation**

The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes. It
is based on the laws and published practices presently in force in Italy, though it is not intended to be,
nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. It does not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to subscribe for, purchase,
own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all
categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may be subject to
special rules. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers
concerning the overall tax consequences of their ownership of the Notes, including the application to
their particular situation of the tax considerations discussed below.

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practices in force
in Italy as of the date of this Information Memorandum and are subject to any changes in law occurring
after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis.

**_Tax treatment of Notes_**

Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of 1 April 1996 (“Decree No. 239”), as subsequently amended,
provides for the applicable regime with respect to the tax treatment of interest, premium and other
income (including the difference between the redemption amount and the issue price) from notes falling
within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) or securities similar to bonds (titoli similari alle
_obbligazioni) issued, inter alia, by companies listed on an Italian regulated market._

For these purposes, pursuant to Article 44 of the Presidential Decree No. 917 of 22 December 1986 (the
“Italian Tax Code” or the “ITC”), as amended and supplemented from time to time, securities similar
to bonds are defined as securities that: (i) incorporate an unconditional obligation to pay, at maturity or
redemption, an amount not less than their nominal value, (ii) do not provide for a remuneration which
is entirely linked to the profits of the issuer, or other companies belonging to the same group or to the
business in respect of which the securities have been issued and that (iii) do not give any right to directly
or indirectly participate in the management of the issuer or of the business in relation to which the
securities are issued nor any type of control on the management.

_Italian resident Noteholders_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is _inter alia_ (i) an individual not engaged in entrepreneurial
activity to which the Notes are connected (unless he has opted for the application of the “risparmio
_gestito” regime – see under “Capital gains tax” below), (ii) a non-commercial partnership, (iii) a non-_


-----

commercial private or public institution or (iv) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income
taxation, interest, premium and other income (other than capital gains) (“Interest”) relating to the
Notes, accrued during the relevant holding period, are subject to a tax withheld at source, referred to as
_imposta sostitutiva, levied at the rate of 26 per cent.._

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations,
Interest relating to the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26 per cent.
_imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial_
activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June 1994 and
Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10 February 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements from time to time
applicable set forth under Italian Law.

If the Noteholders described under inter alia (i) to (iii) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity
to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax and it may be credited
against the overall income tax due by the tax payer in respect of the income derived from its business
activity which will include Interest.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes
are deposited with an authorised intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be
subject to imposta sostitutiva but must be included in the relevant Noteholder’s annual income tax return
and are therefore subject to general Italian corporate taxation (“IRES”) and, in certain circumstances,
depending on the status of Noteholder, also to regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”).

Under the current regime provided by Law Decree No. 351 of 25 September 2001, converted into law
with amendments by Law No. 410 of 23 November 2001 (“Decree No. 351”), Article 32 of Law Decree
No. 78 of 31 May 2010, converted into law with amendments by Law No. 122 of 30 July 2010, and
Legislative Decree No. 44 of 4 March 2014, all as amended, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes
made to Italian resident real estate investment funds created under Article 37 of Legislative Decree No.
58, as amended and supplemented, and Article 14-bis of Law No. 86 of 25 January 1994 and Italian
real estate investment companies with fixed capital - SICAFs (together, the “Real Estate Investment
**Funds”) are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the Real**
Estate Investment Fund, provided that the Notes are timely deposited with a qualified intermediary (as
defined below) but a withholding or substitute tax of 26 per cent. will apply, in certain circumstances,
to income realised by unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the
units.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an open-ended or a closed-ended investment fund, a Società di
_Investimento a Capitale Fisso (“SICAF”) (other than a Real Estate Investment Fund) or a Società di_
_Investimento a Capitale Variabile (“SICAV”) established in Italy (together, the “Fund”) and either (i)_
the Fund or (ii) its manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are
deposited with an authorised intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period
on such Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income at the level of the Fund,
but must be included in the management results of the Fund accrued at the end of each tax period. The
Fund will not be subject to taxation on such result, but a withholding tax of 26 per cent. will apply, in
certain circumstances, to distributions made in favour of unitholders or shareholders or in case of
redemption or sale of the units or shares in the Fund.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article
17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorised
intermediary (as defined below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period
will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio
accrued at the end of the tax period, which will be subject to a 20 per cent. substitute tax. Subject to


-----

certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, Interest relating
to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20 per cent. substitute tax if the Notes are
included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the
requirements from time to time applicable set forth under Italian law.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, _imposta sostitutiva_ is applied by banks, _società di intermediazione_
_mobiliare (“SIMs”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio (“SGRs”), stockbrokers_
and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each an
“Intermediary”) as subsequently amended and integrated.

An Intermediary must (i) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian
resident financial intermediary or a non-Italian resident financial intermediary – acting through a central
securities depository – which is directly connected with Italian Revenue Agency, having appointed an
Italian tax representative for the purposes of Legislative Decree 239 and (ii) intervene, in any way, in
the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of imposta
_sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration,_
which results in a change of the ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change of the Intermediary with
which the Notes are deposited. Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, _imposta_
_sostitutiva is applied and withheld by any Italian intermediary paying Interest to the holders of the Notes_
or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent
establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled
to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the
Notes are effectively connected, an exemption from imposta sostitutiva applies provided that the nonItalian resident beneficial owner is either: (i) resident, for tax purposes, in a country which allows for a
satisfactory exchange of information with the Republic of Italy as listed in the Italian Ministerial Decree
of 4 September 1996, as amended from time to time, or in any other decree to be issued in the future
under the authority of Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, as amended by Legislative Decree No. 147
of 14 September 2015 (the “White List”). Pursuant to Article 1-bis of Ministerial Decree of 4
September 1996, the Ministry of Economy and Finance holds the right to test the actual compliance of
each country included in the list with the exchange of information obligation and, in case of reiterated
violations, to remove it from the list; or (ii) an international body or entity set up in accordance with
international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (iii) a Central Bank or an entity which
manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State; or (iv) an institutional investor which is
established in a country included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer
in its own country of establishement.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders without a permanent establishment
in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected must (i) be the beneficial owners of the payments
of Interest, (ii) deposit, directly or indirectly, the Notes in due time with a resident bank or SIM, or a
permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM or with a non-Italian resident
entity or company participating in a central securities depository which is in contact, via computer, with
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and (iii) file with the relevant depository, prior to or concurrently
with the deposit of the Notes, a statement of the relevant Noteholder, which remains valid until
withdrawn or revoked, in which the Noteholder states to be eligible to benefit from the applicable
exemption from the imposta sostitutiva. Such statement, which is not requested for international bodies
or entities set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy nor
in case of foreign Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign
State, must comply with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of 12 December 2001, as
subsequently amended.


-----

_Imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at the rate of 26 per cent. (or, in any case, at the reduced rate_
provided for by the applicable double tax treaty, if any and subject to timely filing of required
documentation) to Interest paid to Noteholders who do not fall in any of the above mentioned categories
or do not timely and properly comply with the set procedural requirements.

**_Fungible issues_**

Pursuant to Article 11(2) of Decree No. 239, where the Issuer issues a new tranche of notes forming
part of a single series with a previous tranche of notes, for the purposes of calculating the amount of
Interest subject to imposta sostitutiva (if any), the issue price of the new tranche of notes will be deemed
to be the same as the issue price of the original tranche of notes. This rule applies where (a) the new
tranche of notes is issued within 12 months from the issue date of the previous tranche of notes and (b)
the difference between the issue price of the new tranche of notes and that of the original tranche of
notes does not exceed 1 per cent. of the nominal value of the notes multiplied by the number of years
of the duration of the notes.

**_Capital gains tax_**

_Italian resident Noteholders_

Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of the
taxable income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder, also as part
of the net value of the production for IRAP purposes) if realised by an Italian company or a similar
commercial entity, including the permanent establishment in Italy of foreign entities to which the Notes
are effectively connected, or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which
the Notes are connected.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is inter alia (i) an individual holding the Notes not in connection
with an entrepreneurial activity, (ii) a non-commercial partnership, (iii) a non-commercial private or
public institution, any capital gain realised by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes
would be subject to an imposta sostitutiva provided for by Legislative Decree No. 461 of 21 November
1997, levied at the rate of 26 per cent.. Under certain conditions and limitations, Noteholders may set
off losses with gains.

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital
gains realised upon sale or redemption of the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including
from the 26 per cent. imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged
in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June
1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10 February 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term
savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements from time to time
applicable set forth under Italian law.

In respect of the application of _imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt for one of the three regimes_
described below.

(a) “Regime della dichiarazione”. Under the tax return regime, which is the default regime for
Italian Noteholders under (i) through (iii) above, imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be
chargeable, on a yearly cumulative basis, on all capital gains, net of any incurred capital loss
offsettable, realised by the Italian resident individual Noteholder holding the Notes not in
connection with an entrepreneurial activity pursuant to all sales or redemptions of the Notes
carried out during any given tax year. The relevant Noteholder must indicate the overall capital
gains realised in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss offsettable, in the annual
tax return and pay imposta sostitutiva on such gains together with any balance income tax due


-----

for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital
gains realised in any of the four succeeding tax years.

(b) “Regime del risparmio amministrato”. As an alternative to the tax return regime, Italian resident
individual Noteholders under (i) through (iii) above may elect to pay the imposta sostitutiva
separately on capital gains realised on each sale or redemption of the Notes. Such separate
taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to (i) the Notes being deposited with Italian banks,
SIMs or certain authorised financial intermediaries (including permanent establishments in
Italy of foreign intermediaries) and (ii) an express election for the _risparmio amministrato_
regime being timely made in writing by the relevant Noteholder. The depository is responsible
for accounting for _imposta sostitutiva_ in respect of capital gains realised on each sale or
redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realised upon the revocation of
its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the
Italian tax authorities on behalf of the taxpayer, deducting a corresponding amount from the
proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this
purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, where a sale or redemption of the Notes
results in a capital loss, such loss may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realised,
within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to
the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to report
the capital gains in the annual tax return.

(c) “Regime del risparmio gestito”. Any capital gains realised by Italian Noteholder under (i)
through (iii) above who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the
Notes, to an authorised intermediary and have opted for the so-called risparmio gestito regime
will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets
accrued, even if not realised, at year end, subject to a 26 per cent. substitute tax, to be paid by
the managing authorised intermediary. Under the _risparmio gestito regime, any decrease in_
value of the managed assets accrued at year end may be carried forward against increase in
value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. Under the
_risparmio gestito regime, the Noteholder is not required to report the capital gains realised in_
the annual tax return.

Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder that is a Real Estate Investment Fund will be subject neither
to _imposta sostitutiva_ nor to any other income tax at the level of the Real Estate Investment Fund.
However, a withholding tax or a substitute tax at the rate of 26 per cent. will apply, in certain
circumstances, to income realised by unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or
sale of the units or shares.

Any capital gains realised by an Italian Noteholder that is a Fund will not be subject to _imposta_
_sostitutiva, but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant_
tax period. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, but income realised by unitholders or
shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares, may be subject to a
withholding tax of 26 per cent.

Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided
for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) will be included in the result of
the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to the 20 per cent. substitute tax.
Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital
gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20 per cent. substitute tax if the Notes
are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the
requirements from time to time applicable set forth under Italian law.


-----

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

Capital gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of Notes traded on
regulated markets are not subject to imposta sostitutiva. Pursuant to the interpretation of the Italian tax
authorities the notion of multilateral trading facility (“MTF”) under EU Directive 2014/65/CE (so
called MiFID II) should be assimilated to that of “regulated market” for income tax purposes;
conversely, organized trading facilities (OTF), not falling in the definition of MTF under MiFID II,
should not be assimilated to “regulated market” for Italian income tax purposes.

Capital gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of the Notes not traded
on regulated markets are not subject to imposta sostitutiva provided that the beneficial owner of the
capital gains (i) is resident for income tax purposes in a country included in the White List; or (ii) is an
international entity or body set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into
force in Italy; or (iii) is a Central Bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a
foreign State; or (iv) is an institutional investor which is established in a country included in the White
List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own country of establishement, in any
case, to the extent all the requirements and procedures in order to benefit from the exemption from
_imposta sostitutiva are met or complied with in due time, if applicable._

If none of the conditions described above is met, capital gains realised by non-Italian resident
Noteholders from the sale or redemption of the Notes not traded on regulated markets and deemed to
be held in Italy are subject to imposta sostitutiva at the current rate of 26 per cent. under the risparmio
_amministrato regime rules, which is the default regime for non-Italian resident investor, unless the latter_
has opted for the tax return regime or, alternatively, for the risparmio gestito regime

In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to
which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double tax treaty with Italy providing
that capital gains realised upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the country
of tax residence of the recipient, and subject to timely filing of required documentation, will not be
subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realised upon the sale or redemption of the
Notes.

**_Inheritance and gift taxes_**

The transfers of any valuable asset (including the Notes) as a result of death or donation (or other
transfers for no consideration) and the creation of liens (vincoli di destinazione) on such assets for a
specific purpose are taxed as follows:

(i) transfers in favour of the spouse and of direct descendants or direct ancestors are subject to an
inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 4 per cent. on the value of the inheritance or the gift
exceeding € 1,000,000 (per beneficiary);

(ii) transfers in favour of the brothers or sisters are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at
a rate of 6 per cent. on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding € 100,000 (per
beneficiary);

(iii) transfers in favour of all other relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives-in-law up to the third
degree, are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 6 per cent. on the entire
value of the inheritance or the gift; and

(iv) any other transfer is, in principle, subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 8 per
cent. on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift.


-----

If the beneficiary of any such transfer is a disabled individual, whose handicap is recognised pursuant
to Law No. 104 of 5 February 1992, the tax is applied only on the value of the assets (including the
Notes) received in excess of € 1,500,000 at the rates illustrated above, depending on the type of
relationship existing between the deceased or donor and the beneficiary.

Under certain conditions, the _mortis causa transfer of financial instruments included in a long-term_
savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth
by law are exempt from inheritance taxes.

**_Wealth Tax on Financial Products Held Abroad (the so-called IVAFE)_**

In accordance with Article 19 of Decree No. 201 of 6 December 2011, converted with Law No. 214 of
22 December 2011, as subsequently amended, Italian resident individuals, non-commercial entities and
certain partnership (società semplici or similar partnership in accordance with a Article 5 of the ITC)
holding financial products – including the Notes – outside of the Italian territory are required to pay a
wealth tax (“Imposta sul valore delle attività finanziarie detenute all’estero ” – “IVAFE”). The
applicable tax rate is 0.2 per cent of the value of such assets (the tax is determined in proportion to the
period of ownership). Based on Art. 134 of Law Decree 34 of 19 May 2020 (converted into law No. 77
of 17 July 2020), the wealth tax cannot exceed €14,000, for taxpayers different from individuals.

The tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year or – in the lack of the market value
– on the nominal value or redemption value of such financial products held outside of the Italian
territory. Taxpayers can generally deduct from the tax a tax credit equal to any wealth taxes paid in the
State where the financial products are held (up to the amount of the Italian wealth tax due).

Financial assets (including the Notes) held abroad are excluded from the scope of IVAFE if they are
administered by Italian financial intermediaries pursuant to an administration agreement and the items
of income derived from such instruments have been subject to tax by the same intermediaries. In this
case, the below mentioned stamp duty provided for by Article 13(2-ter) of the Tariff, Annex A, Part I,
attached to Presidential Decree No. 642 of 26 October 1972 does apply.

**_Stamp duty_**

Pursuant to Article 13(2-ter) of the Tariff, Annex A, Part I, attached to Presidential Decree No. 642 of
26 October 1972, as subsequently amended, a proportional stamp duty applies on a yearly basis to any
periodic reporting communications which may be sent by a financial intermediary to a Noteholder in
respect of any Notes which may be deposited with such financial intermediary in Italy. The stamp duty
applies at the rate of 0.2 per cent. on the market value or – in the lack of a market value – on the nominal
value or the redemption amount of the securities held. The stamp duty cannot exceed € 14,000, for
taxpayers different from individuals. Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree
issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance on 24 May 2012, the stamp duty applies to any
investor who is a client (as defined in the regulations issued by the Bank of Italy of 29 July 2009, as
subsequently amended and restated) of an entity that exercises in any form a banking, financial or
insurance activity within the Italian territory. The communication is deemed to be sent to the customers
at least once a year, even for instruments for which it is not mandatory.

Stamp duty applies both to Italian resident Noteholders and to non-Italian resident Noteholders, to the
extent that the Notes are held with an Italian based financial intermediary (and not directly held by the
Noteholders outside Italy), in which case wealth tax (see “Wealth Tax on Financial Products Held
_Abroad”) applies to Italian resident Noteholders only)._


-----

**_Transfer tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows: (i) public
deeds and notarised deeds are subject to fixed registration tax at rate of € 200; (ii) private deeds are
subject to registration tax only in case of use (caso d’uso), explicit reference (enunciazione) or voluntary
registration (registrazione volontaria).

**_Tax monitoring_**

Pursuant to Law Decree No. 167 of 28 June 1990, ratified and converted by Law No. 227 of
4 August 1990, as amended, individuals, non-commercial partnerships, non-commercial entities and
similar institutions which are resident of Italy for tax purposes and which over the fiscal year hold or
are beneficial owners of investments abroad or have financial activities abroad must, in certain
circumstances, disclose such investments or financial activities to tax authorities in their income tax
return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within the same
time as prescribed for the income tax return), regardless of the value of such assets (save for deposits
or bank accounts having an aggregate value not exceeding a € 15,000 threshold throughout the year,
which per se do not require such disclosure). This requirement applies even if the taxpayer during the
tax period has totally divested such assets. No disclosure requirements exist for investments and
financial activities (including the Notes) under management or administration entrusted to Italian
resident intermediaries and for contracts concluded through their intervention, provided that the cash
flows and the income derived from such activities and contracts have been subject to Italian withholding
or substitute tax by intermediaries themselves.

**_Luxembourg Taxation_**

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in
Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. The
information contained within this section is limited to Luxembourg withholding tax issues and
prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the
effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a
withholding tax or a tax of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law
and/or concepts only.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is no withholding tax on payments of
principal, premium or interest made to non-resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest
in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase
of the Notes held by non-resident holders of Notes.

_Resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of 23 December 2005 as
amended (the “Relibi Law”) mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal,
premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest
in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of
Notes held by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes.


-----

Under the Relibi Law payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent
established in Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg will be
subject to a withholding tax of 20 per cent. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax
if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth.
Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent.
Accordingly, payments of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law will be
subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 20 per cent.

**The proposed European financial transactions tax (“FTT”)**

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common EU FTT in Belgium,
Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia. In December
2015, Estonia withdrew from the group of states willing to introduce the EU FTT (the “Participating
**Member States”). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.**

The proposed EU FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and
subscription of the Notes should, however, be exempt.

Under the current proposals, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the
Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a
Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a
Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person
established in a Participating Member State; or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to
the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

However, the EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States
and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the
timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the EU
FTT.

**_US. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA,
a “foreign financial institution” (as defined by FATCA) may be required to withhold on certain
payments it makes (“foreign passthru payments”) to persons that fail to meet certain certification,
reporting or related requirements. TIM may be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A
number of jurisdictions (including Italy) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (“IGAs”), which modify
the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in
effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold
under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA
provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as Notes, are
uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or
an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as Notes, such withholding would not apply prior
to the date that is two years after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining foreign
passthru payments are filed with in the U.S. Federal Register. Further, Notes that are issued on or prior
to the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining foreign
passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” for
purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified after such date and/or characterised as


-----

equity for U.S. tax purposes. However, if additional Notes that are not distinguishable from previously
issued Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and are subject to withholding
under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all Notes, including the Notes offered prior to the
expiration of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should
consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in Notes. In the
event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on
the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.

**_Tax information_**

Each Noteholder shall provide in a timely manner any information, form, disclosure, certification or
documentation (“Tax Information”) that the Issuer may reasonably request in writing in order to
maintain appropriate records, report such information as may be required to be reported to any tax or
competent authority (the “Tax Reporting Regimes”) and provide for withholding amounts, if any, in
each case relating to each Noteholder’s Notes in or payments from the Issuer including, without
limitation, any information requested in order to comply with:

(a) the FATCA provisions;

(b) the European Union Council Directive 2011/16/EU (the “DAC”), as amended;

(c) any law, rule or regulation pursuant to or implementing any of the FATCA, the DAC, or any
other regime requiring the exchange of Tax Information or otherwise the Issuer deems
reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Issuer’s affairs.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of the Further Notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to any Further Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

Ordinance (Cap. 32) of Hong Kong (the “CWUMPO”) or which do not constitute an offer to
the public within the meaning of the CWUMPO; and

(b) it has not issued or had in its possession for the purposes of issue, and will not issue or have in

**APPENDIX 1 - OVERVIEW OF KEY OPERATING AND FINANCIAL DATA**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

#### ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS, the TIM Group uses certain
alternative performance measures in its internal presentations (business plan) and in external presentations (to
analysts and investors) for the purposes of enabling a better understanding of the performance of its operations and
its financial position. These indicators in fact represent a useful unit of measurement for assessing the operating
performance of the Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level).

Such measures, which are presented in the periodical financial reports (annual and interim), should, however, not be
considered as a substitute for those required by IFRS. As these measurements are not defined by the IFRSs, their
calculation may differ from the alternative indicators published by other companies. This is why comparability
between companies may be limited.

The alternative performance measures normally used are described below:

█ EBITDA: this indicator is used by TIM as the financial target, in addition to the EBIT. These measures are

calculated as follows:

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations

+ Finance expenses

    - Finance income

+/- Other expenses (income) from investments [(1)]

+/- Share of losses (profits) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method[2]

EBIT – Operating profit (loss)

+/- Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets

+/- Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets

+ Depreciation and amortization

EBITDA – Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals (losses) on noncurrent assets

(1) Expense/(income) from investments for TIM S.p.A..

(2) Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.

- Organic change and impact of the non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these measures express
changes (amount and/or percentage) in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding, where applicable, the effects of
the change in the scope of consolidation, the exchange differences and the non-recurring events and transactions.
The TIM Group presents a reconciliation between the “accounting or reported” figures and the “organic excluding
the non-recurring items”.

- EBITDA margin and EBIT margin: TIM believes that these margins represent useful indicator of the ability of the
Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level) to generate profits from its revenues. In fact, EBITDA margin and
EBIT margin measure the operating performance of an entity by analyzing the percentage of revenues that are
converted into EBITDA and EBIT, respectively.

- Net Financial Debt: TIM believes that the Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator of its ability to meet
its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and other
Financial Assets. The TIM Group presents a table showing the amounts taken from the statements of financial
position and used to calculate the Net Financial Debt of the Group.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual indicator
(renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted net financial
debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that some components of
the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and interest rate for contractual
flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement,
the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects
of IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

Net financial debt is calculated as follows:


-----

+ Non-current financial liabilities
+ Current financial liabilities
+ Financial liabilities directly associated with Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale
A) Gross financial debt
+ Non-current financial assets
+ Current financial assets
+ Financial assets relating to Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale
B) Financial assets
C=(A - B) Net financial debt carrying amount
D) Reversal of fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets
E=(C + Adjusted Net Financial Debt

- Equity Free Cash Flow (EFCF): this financial measure represents the free cash flow available for the remuneration
of own capital, to repay debt and to cover any financial investments and payments of licenses and frequencies. In
particular, the indicator highlights the change in adjusted net financial debt without considering the impacts of
payment of dividends, changes in equity, acquisitions/disposals of equity investments, outlay for the purchase of
licenses and frequencies, increases/decreases of finance lease liabilities payable (new lease operations, renewals
and/or extensions, cancellations/early extinguishing of leases).

The Equity Free Cash Flow measure is calculated as follows:

Reduction/(Increase) in adjusted net financial debt from continuing operations


+/

Impact for finance leases (new lease operations and/or renewals and/or extensions (-)/any terminations/early
extinguishing of leases (+))


    - Payment of TLC licenses and for the use of frequencies

+/- Financial impact of acquisitions and/or disposals of investments

    - Dividend payment and Change in Equity

Equity Free Cash Flow

- Capital expenditures (net of TLC licenses): this financial measure represents the capital expenditures made net of
investments for competence relating to TLC licenses for the use of frequencies.

- Operating free cash flow (OFCF) and operating free cash flow (net of licenses): these financial measures represent
the cash flow available to repay the debt (including lease payables) and cover any financial investments and, in
the case of OFCF, payments of licenses and frequencies.

Operating free cash flow and operating free cash flow (net of licenses) are calculated as follows:

EBITDA

    - Capital expenditures on an accrual basis

+/
Change in net operating working capital (Change in inventories, Change in trade receivables and other net
receivables, Change in trade payables, Change in payables for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum, Other changes in
operating receivables/payables, Change in employee benefits, Change in operating provisions and other changes)

Operating Free Cash Flow

    - Payment of TLC licenses and for the use of frequencies

Operating free cash flow (net of licenses)

Alternative performance measures after lease

Following the adoption of IFRS 16, the TIM Group presents the following additional alternative performance
measures:

- EBITDA After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring items,
from the amounts connected with the accounting treatment of the lease contracts;

- Adjusted Net Financial Debt - After Lease, calculated by excluding from the adjusted net financial debt the net
liabilities related to the accounting treatment of lease contracts. TIM believes that the Adjusted net financial debt
After Lease represents an indicator of the ability to meet its financial obligations;

- Equity Free Cash Flow After Lease, calculated by excluding from the Equity Free Cash Flow the amounts related to
lease payments. In particular, this measure is calculated as follows:

+ Equity Free Cash Flow

    - Principal share of lease payments

This measure is a useful indicator of the ability to generate Free Cash Flow.

#### CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS PERFORMANCE

##### Non-current assets

- Goodwill: increase of 543 million euros, from 18,568 million euros at December 31, 2021 to 19,111 million euros
at December 31, 2022, mainly due to the posting of Goodwill following the acquisition by the Brazil cash
generating unit of part of the mobile business of Oil Movél S.A. (Oi Group) for 502 million euros (2,636 million
reais converted at the real/euro exchange rate of 5.25403). In addition, in the Domestic cash generating unit, an
increase is recorded of 10 million euros connected with the acquisition of control over the companies Staer
Sistemi S.r.l., Mindicity S.r.l. and Movenda S.p.A..

In 2022, the exchange difference was positive for 31 million euros and relates to the goodwill attributed to the
Brazil Cash Generating Unit[1].

Further details are provided in the Notes “Business combinations” and “Goodwill” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements at December 31, 2022 of the TIM Group.

- Intangible assets with a finite useful life: these increased by 509 million euros, from 7,147 million euros at the end
of 2021 to 7,656 million euros at December 31, 2022, representing the balance of:

  - capex (+ 1,128 million euros);

  - amortization charge for the year (-1,517 million euros);

  - other disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net positive balance of 898 million euros).
Exchange gains are recorded for 175 million euros mainly in relation to the Brazil Business Unit; other
changes refer mainly to the entrance into the consolidation scope of the mobile telephone assets of Oi Móvel
S.A. acquired by the TIM Group in April 2022 (685 million euros).

- Tangible assets: these increased by 789 million euros, from 13,311 million euros at the end of 2021 to 14,100
million euros at December 31, 2022, representing the balance of:

  - capex (+2,828 million euros);

  - depreciation charge for the year (-2,348 million euros);

  - other disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net positive balance of 309 million euros).
Exchange gains are recorded for 228 million euros in relation to the Brazil Business Unit; other changes refer
mainly to the entrance into the consolidation scope of the mobile telephone assets of Oi Móvel S.A. (112
million euros).

- Rights of use assets: these increased by 641 million euros, from 4,847 million euros at the end of 2021 to 5,488
million euros at December 31, 2022, representing the balance of:

  - investments (+121 million euros) and increases in lease contracts (+832 million euros);

  - amortization charge for the year (-912 million euros);

  - disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net positive balance of 600 million euros). Exchange

mainly to the entrance into the consolidation scope of the mobile telephone assets of Oi Móvel S.A. (558
million euros) and changes connected with the lesser value of the rights of use recorded as a result of
contractual changes during the year.

- Other non-current assets: came to 5,440 million euros and reduced compared with December 31, 2021 by 5,804
million euros, mainly due to:

  - the sale of the indirect investment held in INWIT following the sale, by TIM S.p.A., of a 41% share in the share
capital of the holding company Daphne 3 S.p.A., which in turn holds a 30.2% share in INWIT;

  - the reversal, by TIM S.p.A., of Deferred tax assets in respect of the exercise of the option to revoke realignment
of goodwill.

##### Consolidated equity

Consolidated equity amounted to 18,725 million euros (22,039 million euros at December 31, 2021), of which 15,061
million euros attributable to Owners of the Parent (17,414 million euros at December 31, 2021) and 3,664 million
euros attributable to non-controlling interests (4,625 million euros at December 31, 2021). In greater detail, the

December 31, 2021).

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2022 showed absorption of 625 million euros: operating cash generation,
positive for 1,617 million euros, is counterbalanced by the payment made in September 2022 of the last tranche of
the right to use 5G frequencies in Italy (1,738 million euros) as well as other payments for the acquisition of rights of
use of telecommunication service frequencies in Brazil and Italy for a total of 504 million euros. In 2021, operating
free cash flow was positive for 1,444 million euros (+1,879 million euros operating cash generation against 435

The Equity Free Cash Flow for 2022 amounted to 624 million euros (632 million euros in 2021). This financial
measure represents the free cash flow available for the remuneration of own capital, to repay debt and to cover any
financial investments and payments of licenses and frequencies.

The Equity Free Cash Flow is calculated as follows:

(million euros) 2022 2021 Change

Reduction/(Increase) in adjusted net financial debt from continuing

In addition to what has already been described with reference to EBITDA, the change in adjusted net financial debt
for 2022 was particularly impacted by the following:

Capital expenditures and for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum

Capital expenditures and expenses for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum for 2022 were 4,077 million euros (4,630
million euros in 2021).

Capex is broken down as follows by operating segment:

(million euros) 2022 2021 Change

In particular:

█ the Domestic Business Unit reports capital expenditures of 3,207 million euros, with a significant portion intended
for the development of FTTC/FTTH networks (including 80 million euros for the acquisition of
telecommunications licenses), down by 170 million euros compared to 2021, mainly due to the streamlining and
prioritization of spending implemented by the Business Unit;

█ the Brazil Business Unit posted capital expenditures in 2022 of 870 million euros (1,253 million euros for 2021).
Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates (+211 million euros), capex decreased by 594 million euros on
the previous year. More specifically, capex for 2021 included the acquisition of frequencies for 5G services (564
million euros). Technological investments represent 91% of total capex and were mainly driven by mobile
Broadband coverage to achieve completion of 100% of Brasil municipalities, by the significant coverage of
capitals with new 5G SA technology and by the full completion of Oi infrastructure integration. Besides Mobile
core business expansion, the Business Unit continued to develop the Ultrabroadband residential business with
FTTH technology (UltraFibre).

Change in net operating working capital

In 2022, net operating working capital showed a reduction of 1,736 million euros (+733 million euros in 2021), mainly
due to the change in trade payables and for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum (-2,144 million euros), only partly
offset by the increase in trade payables (+398 million euros) and other operating receivables/payables (+126 million
euros).

Sale of investments and other disposals flow

In 2022, it was positive for 1,341 million euros and was connected mainly to the sale by TIM S.p.A. to a consortium of
investors led by Ardian, of 41% of the capital of the holding company Daphne 3, which holds a 30.2% share in
Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane ("INWIT"). Further details are provided in the Note on “Investments” in the TIM Group
Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022.

In 2021, it was positive for 1,935 million euros, and mainly comprised the collection consequent to the sale of 37.5%
of FiberCop S.p.A. (1,759 million euros) and the collection consequent to the sale of 51% of I-Systems (172 million
euros).

Change in employee benefits

In 2022, employee benefits increased by a total of 156 million euros, mainly related to the effect of provision net of
uses connected to managerial and non-managerial staff, also in accordance with the application of Art. 4 of Italian Law
no. 92 of June 28, 2012 and the former Art. 41, subsection 5bis, Italian Legislative Decree no. 148/2015, as per
agreements signed during the year with the trade unions and referring entirely to the Italian companies of the
Domestic Business Unit.

Financial investments

In 2022, the item came to 1,905 million euros and mainly included the impacts deriving from the acquisition of 100%
of the share capital of Cozani RJ Infraestrutura e Rede de Telecomunicações S.A., the company corresponding to the
part of the assets, rights and obligations of Oi Móvel - Em Recuperação Judicial, purchased by the TIM Group.

Increases in lease contracts

In 2022, the item came to 832 million euros (667 million euros in 2021) and includes the greater value of rights of
use entered following new passive lease contracts, increases in lease charges and the renegotiation of existing lease
contracts.

Financial expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating requirements flow

In 2022, the flow has a negative balance for a total of 1,090 million euros (negative for 1,061 million euros in 2021).
It mainly includes outflows relating to financial management components, as well as the payment of income tax
expense and changes in non-operating payables and receivables.

Sales of receivables to factoring companies

It should be noted that sales without recourse of trade receivables to factoring companies completed during 2022
resulted in a positive effect on the adjusted net financial debt at December 31, 2022 amounting to 1,155 million euros
(1,536 million euros at December 31, 2021).

The financial risk management policies of the TIM Group are aimed at minimizing market risks, fully hedging exchange
rate risk, and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate diversification of the portfolio, which is also
achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial instruments. Such instruments, it should be stressed, are not
used for speculative purposes and all have an underlying, which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the Group sets an optimum composition for the fixed-rate and
variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that composition. In consideration
of the Group's operating activities, the optimum combination of medium/long-term non-current financial liabilities
has been identified, on the basis of the nominal value, in the 65%-85% range for the fixed-rate component and in the
15%-35% range for the variable-rate component.

In managing market risks, the Group has adopted Guidelines for the “Management and control of financial risk” and
mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual indicator
(renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted net financial debt”,
which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that some components of the fair
value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and of
derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement, the Adjusted net
financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

For further details, see the “Alternative performance measures” chapter.

Adjusted net financial debt amounted to 25,364 million euros at December 31, 2022, an increase of 3,177 million euros
compared to December 31, 2021 (22,187 million euros). This increase is attributable on the one hand to the positive
effect of:

█ the aforementioned cash flow from operative-financial management;

█ the coverage of a total of 1,184 million euros due to the sale of 41% and the consequent deconsolidation of the
holding company Daphne 3, which holds a 30.2% share in Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane ("INWIT"),

which were offset by the impacts related to:

█ the acquisition in Brazil of the mobile business of the Oi Group for a total of 1,874 million euros;

█ the payment of telecommunications frequencies and related commitments in Italy and Brazil for 2,242 million
euros;

█ the accounting impact of the renegotiation of (IFRS 16) lease contracts, 827 million euros net of lease contracts
considered in the Oi acquisition value (557 million euros).

For a better understanding of the information, the table below shows the various ways by which the Net Financial

Net financial debt carrying amount amounted to 25,370 million euros at December 31, 2022, an increase of 2,954 million
euros compared to December 31, 2021 (22,416 million euros). Reversal of the fair value measurement of derivatives
and related financial liabilities/assets recorded a change of 223 million euros, essentially following the greater impact
of the rise in Euro interest rates with respect to USD rates, which effectively revalue the cash flow hedges. This change
is adjusted by the booked Net Financial Debt with no monetary effect.

Adjusted Net Financial Debt – After Lease (net of lease contracts), which is a parameter adopted by main European
peers, was equal to 20,015 million euros at December 31, 2022, up by 2,442 million euros compared to December 31,
2021 (17,573 million euros).

Sustainability-linked RCF - May 2026 4.0 — 4.0 —

Total 4.0 — 4.0 —

(*) In accordance with the contract signed, the Banks have committed to make the funds available on demand (with at least 3 days’ notice). As this is a
“Committed” line, the banks have no mechanisms in place not to honor the request for funds made by the Company, without prejudice to the market standard
early mandatory cancellation clauses (Natural contract expiry, Change in control, Borrower illegality, Events of default).

On July 6, 2022, TIM stipulated a new loan with a pool of leading international banks, which benefits from the “Italy
Guarantee” (in accordance with art. 1, subsection 1 of Decree-Law no. 23 of April 8, 2020 as subsequently amended
and supplemented) for an amount of 2 billion euros.

_Maturities of financial liabilities and average cost of debt_

The average maturity of non-current financial liabilities (including the current portion of medium/long-term financial
liabilities due within 12 months) was 6.51 years.

The average cost of the Group’s debt, considered as the cost for the year calculated on an annual basis and resulting
from the ratio of debt-related expenses to average exposure, stood at approximately 4.4%, while the average cost of
the Group's debt "After Lease" was equal to approximately 3.9%.

_Current financial assets and liquidity margin_

The TIM Group’s available liquidity margin amounted to 9,001 million euros, equal to the sum of:

█ “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Current securities other than investments” for a total of 5,001 million euros
(9,153 million euros at December 31, 2021), also including 494 million euros in repurchase agreements expiring
by April 2023;

█ Sustainability-linked Revolving Credit Facility amounting to 4,000 million euros, totally available.

This margin is sufficient to cover Group financial liabilities (current and otherwise) falling due over the next 18
months.

In particular:

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 3,555 million euros (6,904 million euros at December 31, 2021). The different
technical forms of investing available cash can be analyzed as follows:

- maturities: investments have a maximum maturity of three months;

- counterparty risk: investments by the European companies are made with leading banking, financial and industrial
institutions with high credit quality. Investments by the companies in South America are made with leading local
counterparties;

- Country risk: deposits have been made mainly in major European financial markets.

Current securities other than investments amounted to 1,446 million euros (2,249 million euros at December 31, 2021):
These forms of investment represent alternatives to the investment of liquidity with the aim of improving returns.
They included a total of 368 million euros of treasury bonds held by Telecom Italia Finance S.A., 672 million euros of
bonds purchased by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. with different maturities, all with an active market and consequently
readily convertible into cash, and 406 million euros of investments in monetary funds by the Brazil Business Unit. The
purchases of the above government bonds, which, pursuant to Consob Communication no. DEM/11070007 of August
5, 2011, represent investments in “Sovereign debt securities”, have been made in accordance with the Guidelines for
the “Management and control of financial risk” adopted by the TIM Group.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, adjusted net financial debt decreased by 140 million euros compared to September 30,
2022 (25,504 million euros).

the provision made in the year 2022 of expenses for a total of 570 million euros, mainly linked to outgoing
managerial and non-managerial staff, envisaged according to the application of art. 4 of Law no. 92 of June 28,

In 2021, “Corporate restructuring expenses and other costs” were 367 million euros;

- the greater cost of 76 million euros in the foreign component mainly related to the impact of the exchange rate
change and the local salary dynamics of the Brazil Business Unit;

- the reduction of 40 million euros of the Italian component of ordinary employee expenses, mainly due to the
savings consequent to the reduction in the average salaried workforce, amounting to an average total of -1,960
employees, of whom an average of -1,598 deriving from the application of the Expansion Contract, which entails
a reduction in working hours of staff on the workforce;

The reduction is mainly attributable to the Domestic Business Unit (-767 million euros), partly offset by the increase
in costs relating to the Brazil Business Unit (+85 million euros, including a positive exchange effect for 48 million
euros).

The non-recurring items of 2022 amounted to 77 million euros, mainly due to provisions for disputes, transactions,
regulatory sanctions and related potential liabilities. It includes, in particular, a provision made by TIM S.p.A. of 41
million euros for onerous contracts relating to a multi-year agreement concluded in 2021 which committed the
Company to minimum purchases and the total estimated cost of which for the residual duration of the agreement
became apparent in 2022.

In 2021, the non-recurring items amounted to 735 million euros and mainly referred to provisions made for disputes,
transactions, regulatory sanctions and related potential liabilities as well as expenses connected with the COVID-19
emergency for provisions made as a consequence of the worsening of the expected credit losses of Corporate
customers, connected with the expected evolution of the pandemic. Provision charges included 548 million euros for
the posting of a Contractual Risk Provision for Onerous Contracts (IAS 37) relating to certain contracts for the offer
of multimedia content connected with the partnerships currently in place.

In detail, in accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual
basis, when preparing the company’s separate and consolidated financial statements.

In preparing the Annual Report for 2022, the TIM Group carried out an impairment test on goodwill. The results of
that testing, carried out in accordance with the specific procedure adopted by the Group, confirmed the amounts of
Goodwill allocated to the Group’s individual Cash Generating Units.

Net impairment losses on non-current assets for the year 2021 amounted to 4,120 million euros and related to the
Goodwill impairment loss attributed to the Domestic Cash Generating Unit.

Further details are provided in the Note “Goodwill” to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022
of the TIM Group.

EBIT

TIM Group EBIT for 2022 came to 606 million euros (-3,529 million euros in 2021).

Organic EBIT, net of the non-recurring items, amounted to 1,288 million euros (1,816 million euros in 2021), with an
EBIT margin of 8.2% (11.5% in 2021).

Organic EBIT, net of the non-recurring items, was calculated as follows:

Organic EBIT net of the non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled 256 million euros (330 million euros
in the fourth quarter of 2021).

Other income (expenses) from investments

Other income (expenses) from investments came to 206 million euros (126 million euros in 2021) and are mainly as
follows:

█ net capital gain of 171 million euros connected with the August 2022 sale of 41% of the share capital of the holding
company Daphne 3, which holds a 30.2% share in Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane - INWIT;

█ net capital gain of 33 million euros connected with the October 2022 sale of the equity investment in Satispay.

Finance income (expenses), net

Finance income (expenses) showed a net expense of 1,423 million euros (negative for 1,150 million euros in 2021).
The increase is due to the increased debt exposure of the IFRS 16 lease component in Brazil following the acquisition
of Oi and, to a lesser extent, to the dynamic of interest rates in Europe. This dynamic of interest rates has also
influenced the performance of the mark-to-market of hedging derivatives (in any case this is a change in currency and
accounting non-monetary items).

Income tax expense

In 2022, income tax expense was recorded for 2,066 million euros (3,885 million euros in 2021) and mainly reflects
the impact deriving from the exercise of the revocation option of the realignment of goodwill, resolved by TIM’s Board
of Directors on November 9, 2022, as permitted by the Italian government Budget Law for financial year 2022 and as
detailed in the Provision of the Revenue Agency Manager, published on September 29, 2022.

More specifically - having acknowledged publication of such Measure governing the terms, conditions and operating
procedures for revocation - the Company assessed economic-financial advantageousness and considered it a priority
to strengthen the industrial investments to be made to support the various business areas, an alternative to the
financial commitment connected with the payment of substitute tax on the realignment.

Therefore, as there was no longer any basis for entering Deferred tax assets, they have been written-off entirely for a
net amount of 1,964 million euros as follows:

█ expense of -2,656 million euros for the write-off of deferred tax assets of TIM S.p.A.:

  - in the TIM S.p.A. statements as at December 31, 2020, the amount of 6,569 million euros had been entered
for deferred tax assets in respect of a tax recognition of higher values entered in the financial statements
pursuant to Decree Law 104/2020, art. 110, subsections 8 and 8 bis, which enabled the deductibility over 18
years, starting 2021, of the tax amortization of the realigned value, in respect of substitute tax in the amount
of 3% of the realigned value (692 million euros), to be paid in 3 annual installments of equal amount;

  - in the financial statements at December 31, 2021, a partial write-down had been entered for an amount of 3,913 million euros, connected with the extension to 50 years of the period of tax asset absorption introduced
by Art. 160 of the 2022 Budget Law (Law 234/2021) and the changed assessment of the time frame for
recoverability of deferred tax assets of TIM S.p.A.;

█ income of 692 million euros for the reversal of substitute tax that had been allocated for the realignment; in detail,
entry of a receivable of 231 million euros related to the first installment, paid on June 30, 2021 and reversal of a
payable of 461 million euros for the second and third installments, which will not be paid following revocation of
the realignment. The first installment, as envisaged by the Measure, has been recovered financially, offsetting it
against tax payments made using the “F24” return, which the Company filed in December 2022, following filing
of the supplementary declaration formalizing revocation of the realignment.

Revenues

Domestic Business Unit revenues amounted to 11,858 million euros, down 647 million euros (-5.2%) compared to
2021. In organic terms, they reduce by 685 million euros (-5.5% on 2021).

Revenues from stand-alone services come to 10,799 million euros (-384 million euros compared to 2021, -3.4%) and
suffer the impact of the competition on the customer base, as well as a reduction in ARPU levels; in organic terms,
they drop by 422 million euros compared to 2021 (-3.8%).

In detail:

█ revenues from stand-alone Fixed market services amounted to 8,276 million euros in organic terms, with a negative
change with respect to 2021 (-3.8%%) mainly due to the decrease in accesses and ARPU levels and the presence
in 2021 of non-repeatable transactions on the Wholesale segment, partly offset by the growth in revenues from
ICT solutions (+308 million euros compared to 2021, +22.7%);

█ revenues from stand-alone Mobile market services came to 3,060 million euros (-91 million euros on 2021, -2.9%),
mainly due to the reduction in the customer base connected with Human lines and ARPU levels.

Revenues for Handset and Bundle & Handset, including the change in work in progress, are equal, in organic terms, to
1,059 million euros in 2022, a decrease of 263 million euros compared to 2021, for the most part attributable to the
Fixed Retail segment.

Note that revenues for 2022 include approximately 50 million euros relating to a portion of the commercial agreement
signed in 2022 by TIM and FiberCop with Open Fiber, which requires Open Fiber to purchase from FiberCop, in the
so-called white areas, the right of use (IRU) for overhead infrastructure and access connections to the customer's
home.

As regards the market segments of the Domestic Business Unit, note the following changes compared to 2021:

 - Consumer (the segment consists of all Fixed and Mobile voice and Internet services and products managed and
_developed for individuals and families and of public telephony, caring and the administrative management of_
_customers; it includes the company TIM Retail, which coordinates the activities of its stores): in organic terms, the_
revenues of the Consumer segment totaled 4,736 million euros (-527 million euros compared to previous year, 10.0%) and show a trend, compared to 2021, affected by the challenging competition. The trend seen in total
revenues also applied to revenues from services, which amounted to 4,231 million euros, down by 339 million
euros compared to 2021 (-7.4%).

In particular:

   - revenues from Mobile services totaled, in organic terms, 1,885 million euros (-120 million euros, -6.0%
compared to 2021). The impact of the competitive dynamic remains, albeit with a lesser reduction of the
customer base calling; revenues from traffic are down due to the progressive reduction of interconnection
tariffs;

   - revenues from Fixed services totaled, in organic terms, 2,369 million euros (-231 million euros, -8.9%
compared to 2021), primarily due to lower ARPU levels and the smaller customer base, which in 2021

euros. Growth in Ultrabroadband customers is highlighted.

Revenues for Handsets and Bundles & Handsets in the Consumer segment amounted to 505 million euros, down

The Brazil Business Unit (TIM Brasil group) provides mobile services using UMTS, GSM and LTE technologies. Moreover, the TIM Brasil group
offers fiber optic data transmission using full IP technology, such as DWDM and MPLS and residential Broadband services.

Acquisition of the Oi Group mobile business

On April 20, 2022, TIM S.A. (Brazilian subsidiary of the TIM Group), Telefônica Brasil S.A. and Claro S.A., after having fulfilled the conditions
established by the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE) and the Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (ANATEL), concluded
the acquisition of the mobile telephone assets of Oi Móvel S.A. - Em Recuperação Judicial.

With the conclusion of the transaction, TIM S.A. now holds 100% of the share capital of Cozani RJ Infraestrutura e Rede de Telecomunicações
S.A. ("SPE Cozani"), a company that corresponds to part of the assets, rights and obligations of Oi Móvel acquired by the company.

In September 2022, TIM S.A. and the other buyers of the Oi Móvel mobile telephone assets had identified differences in the assumptions and
calculation criteria that, under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement and Other Covenants (“SPA”), justify a proposal to change the
Adjusted Closing Price (“ACP”) by TIM S.A. of approximately 1.4 billion reais. In addition to differences relating to the Adjusted Closing Price,
others have also been identified relating to the contracts of Cozani (the company into which the business unit corresponding to TIM S.A.’s share
of the assets, rights and obligations of the Oi Móvel mobile telephone business, flowed) with companies supplying mobile infrastructure
services (site/tower rental), which, under the terms of the SPA, give rise to indemnity by the Seller in TIM S.A.’s favor, of approximately 231
million reais. As a result of the differences found, TIM S.A. retained an amount of 634 million reais (671 million reais at December 31, 2022).

In October 2022, considering the Seller’s express violation of the dispute resolution mechanisms provided for in the SPA, TIM S.A.
communicated that the Buyers had no other alternative but to file an arbitration procedure with the Market Arbitration Chamber (Câmara de
Arbitragem do Mercado) of B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão against the Seller to determine the effective amount of the adjustment to the Adjusted
Closing Price, in accordance with the SPA.

Additionally, in October 2022, the 7th Business Court of the Judicial District of Rio de Janeiro handed down a preliminary decision, determining
the deposit in court by the Buyers of approximately 1.53 billion reais – of which approximately 670 million reais by TIM S.A. – in an account
linked to the court-ordered reorganization process of Oi, where it will be safeguarded until a later decision by the arbitration court.

Further details are provided in the Note “Disputes and pending legal actions, other information, commitments and guarantees” to the
Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022 of the TIM Group.

**_Financial year ended 31 December 2021_**

    - **Alternative Performance Measures**

In the report on operations, in the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Separate
Financial Statements of the Parent, TIM, for the year ended 31 December 2021, in addition to the
conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS, the TIM Group also presents certain
alternative performance measures for a better understanding of its performance of operations and
financial position. Such measures, which are presented in the periodical financial reports (annual and
interim), should, however, not be considered as a substitute for those required by IFRS.

Specifically, following the adoption of IFRS 16, the TIM Group presents the following alternative
performance measures:

    - EBITDA adjusted After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic
EBITDA, net of the non-recurring items, from the amounts connected with the accounting
treatment of the lease contracts according to IFRS 16. This financial measure is used by
TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business plans) and in external
presentations (to analysts and investors). It represents a useful unit of measurement for the
evaluation of the operating performance of the TIM Group (as a whole and at the Business
Unit level) and of the Parent, TIM, in addition to EBIT;

    - Adjusted net financial debt After Lease, calculated by excluding from the adjusted net
financial debt the net liabilities related to the accounting treatment of lease contracts
according to IFRS 16. TIM believes that the Adjusted net financial debt After Lease
represents an indicator of the ability to meet its financial obligations;

    - Equity Free Cash Flow After Lease, calculated by excluding from the Equity Free Cash
Flow the amounts related to lease payments. In particular, this measure is calculated as
follows:

+ Equity Free Cash Flow

             - Principal share of lease payments

This financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business plans)
and in external presentations (to analysts and investors) and is a useful indicator of the ability to generate
Free Cash Flow.

The other alternative performance measures used are described below:

    - EBITDA: this financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal
presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It
represents a useful unit of measurement for assessing the operating performance of the TIM
Group (as a whole and at Business Unit level) and of the Parent, TIM, in addition to EBIT.
These measures are calculated as follows:


-----

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations

+ Finance expenses

    - Finance income
+/- Other expenses (Income) from investments(1)
+/- Share of losses (profits) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method(2)

EBIT – Operating profit (loss)

+/- Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets
+/- Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets

+ Depreciation and amortization

EBITDA – Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals
(losses) on non-current assets

(1) Expense/(income) from investments for TIM S.p.A..
(2) Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.

    - Organic change and impact of the non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT:
these measures express changes (amount and/or percentage) in Revenues, EBITDA and
EBIT, excluding, where applicable, the effects of the change in the scope of consolidation,
the exchange differences and the non-recurring events and transactions. TIM believes that
this method of presentation provides a more complete and effective interpretation of the
TIM Group's operating performance (as a whole and with reference to the Business Units)
and of the Parent; it is therefore also used in the presentations to analysts and investors.
This Report on Operations provides a reconciliation between the “reported figure” and the
“organic excluding the non-recurring items” figure.

    - EBITDA margin and EBIT margin: TIM believes that these margins represent useful
indicator of the ability of the TIM Group as a whole and at Business Unit level, and of the
Parent to generate profits from its revenues. In fact, EBITDA margin and EBIT margin
measure the operating performance of an entity by analyzing the percentage of revenues
that are converted into EBITDA and EBIT, respectively. Such indicators are used by TIM
in internal presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and
investors) in order to illustrate the results from operations also through the comparison of
the operating results of the financial year being reported with those of the previous years.

    - Net Financial Debt: TIM believes that the Net Financial Debt represents an accurate
indicator of its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial
Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and other Financial Assets. The Report on Operations
includes two tables showing the amounts taken from the statements of financial position
and used to calculate the Net Financial Debt of the TIM Group and TIM.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual
indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called
“Adjusted net financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets.
Given that some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the
exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial
instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these
purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.


-----

Net financial debt is calculated as follows:

+ Non-current financial liabilities

+ Current financial liabilities

+ Financial liabilities directly associated with Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

A) Gross financial debt

+ Non-current financial assets

+ Current financial assets

+ Financial assets relating to Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

B) Financial assets

C=(A - B) Net financial debt carrying amount

D) Reversal of fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets

E=(C + D) Adjusted net financial debt

    - Equity Free Cash Flow (EFCF): this financial measure is used by TIM as the financial
target in internal presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts
and investors); it represents the free cash flow available for the remuneration of own capital,
to repay debt and to cover any financial investments and payments of licenses and
frequencies. In particular, the indicator highlights the change in adjusted net financial debt
without considering the impacts of payment of dividends, changes in equity,
acquisitions/disposals of equity investments, outlay for the purchase of licenses and
frequencies, increases/decreases of finance lease liabilities payable (new lease operations,
renewals and/or extensions, cancellations/early extinguishing of leases).

The Equity Free Cash Flow measure is calculated as follows:

Reduction/(Increase) in adjusted net financial debt from continuing operations


+/

Impact for finance leases (new lease operations and/or renewals and/or extensions (-)/any terminations/early
extinguishing of leases (+))



    - Payment of TLC licenses and for the use of frequencies

+/- Financial impact of acquisitions and/or disposals of investments

    - Dividend payment and Change in Equity

    - **_Consolidated Financial Position and Cash Flow Performance_**

**_Non-current assets_**

    - Goodwill: this drops by 4,279 million euros, from 22,847 million euros at 31 December
2020 to 18,568 million euros at December 31, 2021, mainly due to the effect of the
aforementioned impairment of Goodwill attributed to the Domestic Cash Generating Unit,
equal to 4,120 million euros, due to the results of the impairment test carried out at 31
December 2021. The balance is also impacted by the reduction of part of the goodwill
attributed to the Brazil cash generating unit (165 million euros) following the dilution from
100% to 49% of the equity investment in the capital of I-System S.A. (formerly FiberCo
Soluções de Infraestrutura S.A.), the company established for the segregation of the
network assets of the TIM Brasil Group and the related supply of infrastructure services.
An increase is also recorded of 2 million euros relating to the recognition of provisional


-----

goodwill connected with the acquisition by Olivetti of 100% of Staer Sistemi S.r.l.
completed in September 2021. In 2021, the exchange difference is positive for 4 million
euros and relates to the goodwill attributed to the Brazil Cash Generating Unit [1].

Further details are provided in the Note “Goodwill” to the Consolidated Financial Statements at
December 31, 2021 of the TIM Group.

    - Intangible assets with a finite useful life: these increased by 407 million euros, from 6,740
million euros at the end of 2020 to 7,147 million euros at December 31, 2021, representing
the balance of the following items:

`o` capex (+ 1,886 million euros);

`o` amortization charge for the year (-1,511 million euros);

`o` other disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net positive balance of
32 million euro, of which 13 million euro of positive exchange differences essentially
relating to the Brazil Business Unit).

    - Tangible assets: these increased by 170 million euros, from 13,141 million euros at the end
of 2020 to 13,311 million euros at December 31, 2021, representing the balance of the
following items:

`o` capex (+2,665 million euros);

`o` depreciation charge for the year (-2,284 million euros);

`o` other disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net negative balance of
211 million euros, including 192 million euros for the deconsolidation of the Brazilian
company I-Systems S.A. and 24 million euros in exchange gains).

    - Rights of use assets: these fell by 145 million euros, from 4,992 million euros at the end of
2020 to 4,847 million euros at December 31, 2021, representing the balance of the
following items:

`o` investments (+79 million euros) and increases in lease contracts (+667 million euros);

`o` amortization charge for the year (-695 million euros);

`o` disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net negative balance of 196
million euros). Exchange differences are positive for 15 million euros and mainly relate
to the Brazil Business Unit. Other changes mainly included the lower value of the rights
of use recorded as a result of contractual changes during the period.

    - Other non-current assets: these come to 11,244 million euros and decline on 31 December
2020 by 3,458 million euros, mainly following the partial write-off by the Parent Company
TIM of the deferred tax assets recognized in 2020 in respect of the tax recognition of higher
values booked in accordance with Decree Law 104/2020, art. 110, subsections 8 and 8 bis.
Further details are provided in the Note “Income tax expense (current and deferred)” to the
Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2021 of the TIM Group.

1The spot exchange rate used for the translation into euro of the Brazilian real (expressed in terms of units of local currency per 1 euro) was
6.32047 at 31 December 2021 and 6.37680 at 31 December 2020.

**_Consolidated equity_**

Consolidated equity amounted to 22,039 million euros (28,840 million euros at 31 December 2020), of
which 17,414 million euros attributable to Owners of the Parent (26,215 million euros at December 31,
2020) and 4,625 million euros attributable to non-controlling interests (2,625 million euros at December
31, 2020). In greater detail, the changes in consolidated equity were the following:

The adjusted net financial debt amounted to 22,187 million euros, down by 1,139 million euros
compared to 31 December 2020 (23,326 million euros).

The TIM Group’s operating free cash flow for 2021 is positive for 1,444 million euros (3,304 million
euros in 2020), i.e. 1,879 million euros (3,414 million euros in 2020), net of 435 million euros (110
million euros in 2020) related to the acquisition of rights to use telecommunication service frequencies.

Moreover, the main transactions that had an impact on the change in adjusted net financial debt are as

In addition to what has already been described with reference to EBITDA, the change in adjusted net
financial debt for 2021 was particularly impacted by the following:

**_Capital expenditures and for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum_**

Capital expenditures and expenses for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum for 2021 were 4,630 million
euros (3,409 million euros in 2020).

|Consolidated Total 4,630 100.0|3,409 100.0 1,221|
|% of Revenues 30.2|21.6 8.6pp|


In particular:

    - the Domestic Business Unit records capital expenditure for 3,377 million euros, +629
million euros on 2020, an increase mainly due to the development of the FTTC/FTTH
networks and payment of licenses for 240 million euros to the Italian Ministry of Economic
Development (MISE) for the extension of rights of use relating to frequencies (2100 MHz);

    - the Brazil Business Unit posted capital expenditures in 2021 of 1,253 million euros (661
million euros for 2020). Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates (-49 million
euros), capex grew by 641 million euros, mainly to strengthen the mobile ultrabroadband
infrastructure and the development of the fixed broadband business of TIM Live. More
specifically, the auction for 5G frequencies in Brazil, which closed in November 2021, saw
the Brazil Business Unit committed to a total investment of 564 million euros for
frequencies along with the related commercial commitments to the entities established to
pursue the infrastructure projects.

**_Change in net operating working capital_**

The change in net operating working capital for 2021 reflects a positive change of 733 million euros
(+772 million euros in 2020), mainly as a consequence of the change in trade payables and for mobile
telephone licenses/spectrum (+953 million euros), partly offset by the negative change in other
operating receivables/payables (-438 million euros).

**_Sale of investments and other disposals flow_**

This is positive for 1,935 million euros and mainly includes the collection made on the sale of 37.5%
of FiberCop S.p.A. by TIM to the indirect subsidiary of KKR Global Infrastructure Investors III L.P.
(1,759 million euros) and the collection consequent to the sale of 51% of I-Systems (formerly FiberCo
Soluções de Infraestrutura) by TIM S.A. to IHS Fiber Brasil - Cessão de Infraestruturas Ltda. ("IHS
Brasil") (172 million euros). Further details are provided in the Note on “Investments” in the TIM
Group Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2021.

In 2020, the flow was positive for 1,294 million euros and mainly benefited from the deconsolidation
of INWIT, as well as collections deriving from sales by the TIM Group of INWIT shares totaling
approximately 7.3% of the share capital.

**_Share capital increases/reimbursements, including incidental costs_**

In 2021, the flow is negative for 42 million euros and refers to the partial distribution of reserves of the
subsidiary Daphne 3 - in which TIM has contributed a total of 30.2% of INWIT shares - to a shareholder
outside the TIM Group.

In 2020, the flow was positive for 1,164 million euros, mainly as a consequence of the contribution
made by shareholders outside the TIM Group to the share capital increases of subsidiaries. More
specifically, they included the increase in capital of Daphne 3.


-----

**_Increases in lease contracts_**

In 2021, the item came to 667 million euros (1,288 million euros in 2020) and includes the greater value
of rights of use entered following new passive lease contracts, increases in lease charges and the
renegotiation of existing lease contracts.

**_Financial expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating requirements flow_**

In 2021, the flow has a negative balance for a total of 1,061 million euros (positive for 283 million
euros in 2020). It mainly includes outflows relative to financial management components, as well as
the payment of income taxes and changes in non-operating payables and receivables.

**_Sales of receivables to factoring companies_**

It should be noted that sales without recourse of trade receivables to factoring companies completed
during 2021 resulted in a positive effect on the adjusted net financial debt at 31 December 2021
amounting to 1,536 million euros (1,970 million euros at 31 December 2020).

**_Net financial debt_**

Net financial debt is composed as follows:


-----

_Bonds_ _3,512_ _988_ _2,524_
_Amounts due to banks, other financial payables and liabilities_ _898_ _1,541_ _(643)_
_Current financial liabilities for lease contracts_ _648_ _628_ _20_

The financial risk management policies of the TIM Group are aimed at minimizing market risks, fully
hedging exchange rate risk, and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate diversification of
the portfolio, which is also achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial instruments. Such
instruments, it should be stressed, are not used for speculative purposes and all have an underlying,
which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the TIM Group sets an optimum composition for
the fixed- rate and variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that
composition. Taking into account the TIM Group's operating activities, the optimum mix of
medium/long-term non-current financial liabilities has been established, on the basis of the nominal
amount, at a range of 65%–85% for the fixed-rate component and 15%–35% for the variable-rate
component.

In managing market risks, the TIM Group has adopted Guidelines for the “Management and control of
financial risk” and mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the
usual indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure

called “Adjusted net financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial
markets. Given that some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting
the exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial
instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these
purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

For further details, see the “Alternative performance indicators” chapter.

Adjusted net financial debt amounted to 22,187 million euros at 31 December 2021, a decrease of 1,139
million euros compared to December 31, 2020 (23,326 million euros). The reduction in debt, brought
about by the generation of operating cash, the completion of the purchase by KKR Infrastructure of
37.5% of FiberCop from TIM for an equivalent value of 1,759 million euros and the sale for 172 million
euros in Brazil of 51% of the company I-Systems S.A. (formerly FiberCo), owner of the secondary fiber
network, has been partially limited by the payments of dividends (368 million euros), the sanction (116
million euros) connected with the Antitrust Case A514 (alleged abuse of a dominant market position
on the wholesale access services market and for retail services of the broadband and ultrabroadband
fixed network), substitute tax on the realigned value of assets (231 million euros), the extension of the
rights of use of frequencies on the 2100 MHz bandwidth (240 million euros), the installment on the 5G
license (55 million euros) and the purchase under auction of frequencies for the implementation of 5G
in Brazil (140 million euros).
For a better understanding of the information, the table below shows the various ways by which the Net
Financial Debt can be shown:

Net financial debt carrying amount amounted to 22,416 million euros at 31 December 2021, a decrease
of 1,298 million euros compared to December 31, 2020 (23,714 million euros). Reversal of the fair
value measurement of derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets recorded an annual change of
159 million euros, substantially following the rise in Euro interest rates, which, coupled with the final
calculation of interest flows, effectively revalue the cash flow hedges. This change is adjusted by the
booked Net Financial Debt with no monetary effect.

Adjusted Net Financial Debt – After Lease (net of the impact of all leases), which is a parameter adopted
by main European peers, was equal to 17,573 million euros at 31 December 2021, down by 1,021
million euros compared to 31 December 2020 (18,594 million euros).

**_Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan_**

The following table shows committed credit lines available at December 31, 2021:

(billion euros) 12/31/2021 12/31/2020
Agreed Drawn down Agreed Drawn down

Sustainability-linked RCF - maturing May 2026 4.0 — — —

Revolving Credit Facility – maturing January 2023 — — 5.0 —

Bridge to Bond Facility – maturing May 2021 — — 1.7 —

Total 4.0 — 6.7 —

At 31 December 2021, TIM had bilateral Term Loans for 850 million euros with various banking
counterparties and an overdraft facility for 200 million euros, drawn down for the full amount.

On 19 January 2021, TIM entirely canceled the credit line for 1.7 billion euros, which was not used,
stipulated on 18 May 2020 as bridge to bond for subsequent issues on the bond market and an initial
maturity of 12 months with an option of extension for another 12 months.

On 13 May 2021, TIM extended the Revolving Credit Facility by 5 years, reducing the amount to 4
billion euros and making it the TIM Group's first ever ESG-linked credit facility.

On 23 December 2021, the subsidiary FiberCop S.p.A. signed a new 5-year Term Loan for an amount
of 1.5 billion euros with a pool of international banks, fully drawn down.

**_Maturities of financial liabilities and average cost of debt_**

The average maturity of non-current financial liabilities (including the current portion of medium/longterm financial liabilities due within 12 months) was 6.53 years.

The average cost of the TIM Group’s debt, considered as the cost for the year calculated on an annual
basis and resulting from the ratio of debt-related expenses to average exposure, stood at approximately
3.7%, while the average cost of the TIM Group's debt "After Lease" was equal to approximately 3.4%.

**_Current financial assets and liquidity margin_**

The TIM Group’s available liquidity margin amounted to 13,153 million euros, equal to the sum of:

    - “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Current securities other than investments” for a total of
9,153 million euros (5,921 million euros at 31 December 2020), also including 838 million
euros in repurchase agreements expiring by April 2022;

    - Sustainability-linked Revolving Credit Facility amounting to 4,000 million euros, totally
available.

|Bridge to Bond Facility – maturing May 2021 — —|1.7 —|
|Total 4.0 —|6.7 —|


-----

This margin is sufficient to cover the TIM Group’s financial liabilities (current and otherwise) falling
due over the next 36 months.

In particular:

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 6,904 million euros (4,829 million euros at December 31, 2020).
The different technical forms of investing available cash can be analyzed as follows:

    - maturities: investments have a maximum maturity of three months;

    - counterparty risk: investments by the European companies are made with leading banking,
financial and industrial institutions with high credit quality. Investments by the companies
in South America are made with leading local counterparties;

    - Country risk: deposits have been made mainly in major European financial markets.

Current securities other than investments amounted to 2,249 million euros (1,092 million euros at 31
December 2020): These forms of investment represent alternatives to the investment of liquidity with
the aim of improving returns. They included a total of 840 million euros of treasury bonds held by
Telecom Italia Finance S.A., 675 million euros of bonds purchased by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. with
different maturities, all with an active market and consequently readily convertible into cash, and 734
million euros of investments in monetary funds by the Brazil Business Unit. The purchases of the above
government bonds, which, pursuant to Consob Communication no. DEM/11070007 of August 5, 2011,
represent investments in “Sovereign debt securities”, have been made in accordance with the Guidelines
for the “Management and control of financial risk” adopted by the TIM Group.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted net financial debt came to 22,187 million euros up 23 million
euros on 30 September 2021 (22,164 million euros): the stability of the debt level derives from the
attenuation of the positive effects deriving from the operative and financial management following the
assessment over the contractual terms of finance lease liabilities. In addition, the transactions should be
noted carried out in Brazil, such as the sale of 51% of the company I-Systems S.A. (formerly FiberCo)
and the acquisition under auction of the frequencies for the implementation of 5G.

The organic change in the TIM Group’s consolidated revenues is calculated by excluding the negative
effect of exchange rate changes [2] (-226 million euros), the changes in the scope of consolidation
(INWIT) (-3 million euros) as well as non-recurring items. More specifically, 2021 was affected by
adjustments for non-recurring income totaling -5 million euros. 2020 was affected by adjustments of
non-recurring revenues for -39 million euros, as a result of the commercial initiatives of TIM to support
customers in dealing with the COVID-19 emergencies.

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 totaled 3,976 million euros (4,148 million euros in the fourth
quarter of 2020).

**_EBITDA_**

TIM Group EBITDA for the year 2021 came to 5,080 million euros (6,739 million euros in the year
2020, -9.6% in organic terms).

The breakdown of EBITDA and the EBITDA margin broken down by operating segment for 2021
compared with 2020, are as follows:

Organic EBITDA - net of the non-recurring items amounted to 6,223 million euros; the EBITDA
margin was 40.6% (6,882 million euros in 2020, with an EBITDA margin of 44.1%).

In 2021 EBITDA, which includes an improvement of deferred contract costs linked to the reduction of
churn, suffered net non-recurring charges for a total of 1,143 million euros, of which 25 million euros
attributable to the COVID-19 emergency in Italy.

In 2020, the TIM Group recorded non-recurring charges for a total of 318 million euros (net of the
change in scope and the exchange effect for a total of 6 million euros), of which 108 million euros were
attributable to the COVID-19 emergency in Italy.

2The average exchange rates used for the translation into euro (expressed in terms of units of local currency per 1 euro) were 6.35936 in
2021 and 5.88806 in 2020 for the Brazilian real. For the US dollar, the average exchange rates used were 1.18285 in 2021 and 1.14179 in
2020. The effect of the change in exchange rates is calculated by applying the foreign currency translation rates used for the current period
to the period under comparison.

purchases of goods for resale, sales expenses taking into account the improvement of deferred contract
costs linked to the reduction of churn, leased asset costs, particularly for software license rental and
greater hosting charges on non-strategic sites connected with the Master Service Agreement (MSA)
stipulated between TIM and INWIT, with effect from March 31, 2020.

    - the increase of 293 million euros in the Italian component of “restructuring and other
expenses” as a consequence of the application of the trade union agreements signed by the
Parent company with the trade unions on March 08, 2021 and on April 23, 2021 and the
agreements signed respectively on March 15, 2021 by the company Olivetti on April 27,
2021 by Noovle and on May 06, 2021 by the company Telecom Italia Sparkle;

    - the increase of 9 million euros of the Italian component of ordinary employee expenses,
mainly due to the balance of savings consequent to the reduction in the average salaried
workforce (amounting to a total of -1,313 average employees, of whom an average of -184
deriving from the application of the Expansion Contract) and the expenses related to the
renewal of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement;

    - the substantive lack of change in the foreign component mainly related to the balance of
the impact of the exchange rate change and the local salary dynamics of the Brazil Business
Unit.

19 emergency (20 million euros) following the worsening of the expected credit loss of corporate
customers tied to the expected evolution of the pandemic.

For further details, in addition to that reported in the “Non-recurring events” chapter of this Report on
Operations, see the Note "Significant non-recurring events and transactions" in the Consolidated
Financial Statements as at December 31, 2021 of the TIM Group.

With reference to the “impairment and expenses connected with credit management”, the reduction on
2020 (-118 million euros) is the consequence of the consolidation of TIM’s program to optimize
processes started in 2020, aimed at increasing the efficiency of credit management, all round,
intervening on the whole process involving the customer. More specifically, reference is made to the
acceptance, management and collection of debt through to the assessment model of the new commercial
offers.

The non-recurring items of the year 2020 of 148 million euros mainly relating to provisions and charges
of the Domestic Business Unit related to credit management in relation to the COVID-19 emergency
(46 million euros) as well as disputes and regulatory fines and expenses connected with agreements and
the development of non-recurring projects.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

In 2021 the item amounts to 4,490 million euros (4,616 million euros in 2020) and breaks down as
follows:

(million euros) 2021 2020 Changes

Amortization of intangible assets with a finite useful life 1,511 1,627 (116)

Depreciation of tangible assets 2,284 2,301 (17)
Amortization of rights of use assets 695 688 7

Total 4,490 4,616 (126)

In particular, in 2021, the TIM proceeded to revise the useful life of the IT software applications; in
actual fact, following the start of the Digital Enterprise project and consequent verification of the
effective and prospective duration of the systems impacted, the amortization period of assets used in
fixed and mobile IT software development was revised, taking it from 3 to 6 years, with an impact of
lesser period amortization for approximately 115 million euros.

Furthermore, depreciation of tangible assets included the estimated acceleration of depreciation as a
consequence of both the switch-off of 3G in Italy, expected for June 2022 (equal to approximately 23
million euros) and the switch-off of part of the copper access network in Italy, hypothesized for end
2030 (equal to 31 million euros).

**_Net impairment losses on non-current assets_**

These amounted to 4,120 million euros in 2021 (8 million euros in 2020).

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on at
least an annual basis, when preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements.

With reference to the Domestic Cash Generating Unit (CGU), the impairment test, conducted during
the preparation of the 2021 Annual Financial Report, took as a reference the flows of the 2022-2024
Industrial Plan - which, based on the results of the 2021 final accounting, reflects realistic aspects on
future developments and outlines all the actions to create value for shareholders - on the basis of the
projections up to 2026, assuming the use of domestic market assets in continuity with the conditions as
at 31 December 2021 and using a discount rate updated to the financial market conditions as at 31
December 2021.

The configuration of the recoverable amount is the Fair Value estimated on the basis of the income
approach, which has highlighted a value reduction of 4,120 million euros of goodwill attributed to the
Domestic Cash Generating Unit.

Impairment testing of the Brazil Cash Generating Unit did not reveal any reduction in the value of
goodwill allocated to it. The valuation was based on the Market Cap of TIM Brasil as at 31 December

(617 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2020).

**_Other income (expenses) from investments_**

The item is positive for 126 million euros and mainly included the net capital gain (119 million euros)
recognized following the dilution from 100% to 49% of the equity investment of the Brazilian
subsidiary TIM S.A. in I-Systems S.A. (formerly FiberCo Soluções de Infraestrutura S.A.), a company
established by TIM S.A. for the segregation of its network assets and the provision of infrastructure
services, following the completion of the agreement between TIM S.A. and IHS Fiber Brasil - Cessão
de Infraestruturas Ltda. (IHS Brasil). See the section “Financial and Operating Highlights of the
Business Units of the TIM Group – Brazil Business Unit” of the Report on Operations for more details.

**_Finance income (expenses), net_**

Finance income (expenses), net was negative and amounted to 1,150 million euros (-1,179 million euros
in 2020): the improvement was mainly driven by lower finance expenses, connected to the reduction in
the TIM Group’s average debt exposure, only partly offset by the positive effects of the change of some
non-monetary items, of a currency and accounting nature.

In 2021, the flow has a negative balance for a total of 3,885 million euros (positive for 5,955 million
euros in 2020). Tax expense mainly relates to the partial writing off of the deferred tax assets entered
in 2020 in exchange for the tax recognition of higher values booked in accordance with Decree Law
104/2020 Art. 110, subsections 8 and 8 bis; this write-off is due to the extension to 50 years of the
period of tax asset absorption, introduced by Art. 160 of the 2022 Budget Law (Law 234/2021) and the
changed assessment of the time frame for recoverability of deferred tax assets of TIM S.p.A. Further
details are provided in the Note “Income tax expense (current and deferred)” to the Consolidated
Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 of the TIM Group.

**_Revenues_**

Domestic Business Unit revenues amounted to 12,505 million euros, changing by -400 million euros (3.1%) compared to 2020. In organic terms, they reduce by 423 million euros (-3.3% in 2020); in
particular, revenues in 2021 were affected by non-recurring adjustments for 5 million euros, while
revenues in 2020 were affected by non-recurring items for 39 million euros mainly referring to
adjustments of revenues connected to TIM’s commercial initiatives to support customers in facing the
COVID-19 emergency.

Revenues from stand-alone services come to 11,183 million euros (-422 million euros compared to
2020, -3.6%) and suffer the impact of the competition on the customer base and a reduction in ARPU
levels; in organic terms, net of the above-specified non-recurring items, they drop by 439 million euros
compared to 2020 (-3.8%).

In detail:

    - revenues from stand-alone Fixed market services amounted to 8,574 million euros in
organic terms, with a change compared to 2020 of -2.3% mainly due to the decrease in
ARPU levels in the Consumer segment, which is also reflected in the trend of revenues
from broadband services (-93 million euros compared to 2020, -4.0%), partly offset by the
growth in revenues from ICT solutions (+242 million euros compared to 2020, +22.9%);

    - revenues from stand-alone Mobile market services came to 3,152 million euros in organic
terms (-242 million euros vs 2020, -7.1%), mainly due to ARPU levels and the reduction
in the customer base connected with Human lines.

Revenues for Handset and Bundle & Handset, including the change in work in progress, are equal, in
organic terms, to 1,322 million euros in 2021, with an increase of 16 million euros compared to 2020,

`o` revenues from Mobile stand-alone services totaled, in organic terms, 2,161 million
euros (-182 million euros, -7.8% compared to 2020). The impact of the competitive
dynamic remains, albeit with a lesser reduction of the customer base calling; revenues

interconnection tariffs;

`o` revenues from Fixed stand-alone services totaled, in organic terms, 2,600 million euros
(-270 million euros, -9.4% compared to 2020), primarily due to lower ARPU levels
and the smaller Customer Base, which declined gradually over the course of 2021. The
growth of broadband customers is highlighted, in particular ultrabroadband.

Revenues for Handsets and Bundles & Handsets in the Consumer segment amounted to 693
million euros, -34 million euros compared to 2020 (-4.6%). The decrease is mainly due to lesser
sales volumes of modems on fixed lines.

solutions managed and developed for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), Small
Offices/Home Offices (SOHOs), Top customers, the Public Sector, Large Accounts, and

organic terms, net of the aforesaid non-recurring items, revenues for the Business segment
amounted to 4,117 million euros (in line with 2020, of which -0.7% for revenues from the
stand-alone services component). In particular:

2020 (-0.5%), linked to the revenues from stand-alone services component (-4.4%) and
the ARPU trend;

`o` total Fixed revenues in organic terms improved slightly by +6 million euros compared
to 2020 (+0.2%), due to the revenues from services component (+0.4%) thanks to the
increase in revenues from ICT services.

- Wholesale National Market: the segment consists of the management and development of
the portfolio of regulated and unregulated wholesale services for Fixed-line and Mobile
telecommunications operators in the domestic market. The following companies are
included: TI San Marino and Telefonia Mobile Sammarinese. The Wholesale National
Market segment revenues in 2021 came to 1,946 million euros, up by +40 million euros
(+2.1%) compared to 2020, with a positive performance mainly driven by the growth in
accesses in the ultrabroadband segment.

- Wholesale International Market: includes the activities of the Telecom Italia Sparkle group,
which operates in the market for international voice, data and Internet services for fixed
and mobile telecommunications operators, ISPs/ASPs (Wholesale market) and
multinational companies through its own networks in the European, Mediterranean and
South American markets. Revenues for the Wholesale International Market segment for

following the worsening of the expected credit loss of corporate customers connected with the expected
evolution of the pandemic.

million euros compared with 2020, which is the consequence of the consolidation of the program to

The Brazil Business Unit (TIM Brasil group) provides mobile services using UMTS, GSM and LTE
technologies. Moreover, the Tim Brasil group offers fiber optic data transmission using full IP
technology, such as DWDM and MPLS and residential broadband services.

**_Offer for the purchase of the OI group mobile business_**

In December 2020, TIM announced that the offer presented by TIM S.A. (the operating company of
the TIM Brasil Group) together with Telefônica Brasil S.A. (VIVO) and Claro S.A., had been awarded
the contract in the competitive sale process for the purchase of the Oi group’s mobile business. The
transaction is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent provided for in the agreements
and the authorizations of the competent Authorities. Closing is expected during the early months of
2022.

The total value of the transaction amounts to 16.5 billion reais, which is summed with the consideration
offered to the Oi Group, of approximately 819 million reais, as net present value (NPV) for the Takeor-Pay Data Transmission Capacity Contracts. TIM Brasil will participate in the transaction with an
investment of approximately 7.3 billion reais, to be paid at closing, and 476 million reais relating to
TIM Brasil’s share of the net present value (NPV) of the contracts. Given the low debt and the favorable
market conditions, TIM S.A. believes it can finance the acquisition through cash and the local debt
market. However, in the event of any changes in market conditions, TIM S.A. will evaluate all available
options.

The purchase plan provides for TIM Brasil, Telefônica Brasil and Claro to divide up Oi’s mobile assets
and, in particular, its customers, radio frequencies and mobile access infrastructure.

More specifically, TIM Brasil will be allocated:

    - approximately 14.5 million customers (corresponding to 40% of UPI Ativos Móveis’ total
customer base), according to Anatel’s data of April 2020. The allocation took into
consideration criteria that favor competition among the operators present in the Brazilian
market;

    - approximately 49 MHz as a national average weighted by population (54% of UPI Ativos
Móveis radio frequencies). The division of frequencies strictly respects the spectrum limits
per group established by Anatel;

    - approximately 7.2 thousand mobile access sites (corresponding to 49% of total UPI Ativos
Móveis sites).

On February 09, 2022, the offer presented by TIM S.A. together with Telefônica Brasil S.A. (VIVO)
and Claro S.A., was approved by the antitrust authority CADE (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa
Economica).

The decision follows the pronunciation of the reglementary Authority Anatel (Agência Nacional de
Telecomunicações), which on February 1, 2022, had expressed itself in favor of the transfer of control
of Oi’s mobile assets.

The closing of the deal, which will define a new infrastructure structure for the Telco market in Brazil,
still depends on the fulfillment of specific conditions foreseen in the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The
operation, with which TIM Brasil will acquire the most relevant share of the assets of the Oi Group, is
expected to bring significant benefits to the Brazilian TLC sector, maintaining a high degree of


-----

competition and ensuring the necessary investments for the development of the country’s digital
advancement.

The transaction, as of its completion, will add value not only to its Brazilian subsidiary but to the whole
TIM Group and its shareholders as it will accelerate its growth and increase operating efficiency through
relevant synergies. Furthermore, positive effects are also expected for customers, as the transaction is
likely to improve the users’ experience and the quality of services offered. Finally, the transaction is
expected to benefit the entire telecommunications sector in Brazil, which will be strengthened in its
investment capacity, technological innovation, as well as its competitiveness.

**_Agreement with IHS for shareholding in FiberCo_**

In November 2021, once the regulatory authorization process had been completed, the agreement was
stipulated between TIM S.A. and IHS Fiber Brasil - Cessão de Infraestruturas Ltda. (“IHS Brasil”), in
order to acquire an equity stake in FiberCo Soluções de Infraestrutura S.A. ("FiberCo"), a company
established by TIM S.A. for the segregation of network assets and the provision of infrastructure
services.

Following the operation closing, IHS Brasil holds 51% of the share capital of FiberCo, with the
remaining 49% is held by TIM S.A.. At the same time, FiberCo was renamed I-Systems.

Shareholder relations are governed by a shareholders' agreement.

The operation was worth 1.68 billion reais, divided up into a primary component of 0.58 billion reais,
for the treasury of I-Systems, and a secondary component of 1.10 billion reais, paid to TIM S.A.. The
enterprise value of I-Systems was established at 2.71 billion reais and the equity value, after the
contribution of the primary component, was set at 3.29 billion reais. The operation also considers
possible additional earnings deriving from an earn-out component.

In addition, under the scope of the Operation, TIM and I-Systems have stipulated an agreement to
develop the Fiber-to-the-Site (FTTS) infrastructure to connect TIM sites in the areas in which FiberCo
will be developing the new infrastructure granting access to fiber optic broadband.

**_Revenues_**
Revenues for 2021 of the Brazil Business Unit (TIM Brasil group) amounted to 18,058 million reais
(17,268 million reais in 2020, +4,6%), speeding up on the levels recorded from the third quarter of
2020.

The acceleration has been driven by service revenues (17,497 million reais vs 16,665 million reais in
2020, +5.0%) with mobile service revenues growing +4.7% on 2020. This performance is mainly
related to the continuous recovery of the pre-paid and post-paid segments. Revenues from fixed services
have grown by 8.8% compared to the previous year, determined above all by the growth rate of TIM
Live.

Revenues from product sales totaled 561 million reais (603 million reais in 2020).

Revenues in Q4 2021 totaled 4,799 million reais, increased by 2.6% on the fourth quarter of 2020 (4,678
million reais).

The mobile ARPU for 2021 was 26.4 reais, up from the figure recorded in 2020 (24.9 reais) thanks to
general repositioning in the post-paid segment and new commercial initiatives intended to promote the
use of data and average expenditure per customer.

Total mobile lines in place at December 31, 2021 amounted to 52.1 million, +0.7 million compared to
December 31, 2020 (51.4 million). This variation was mainly driven by the postpaid segment (+1.0
million), partially offset by the performance in the prepaid segment (-0.3 million), in part due to the
consolidation underway in the market for second SIM cards. Post-paid customers represented 43.9% of
the customer base as of December 31, 2021, 1.5 percentage points higher than at December 2020
(42.4%).


-----

The TIM Live BroadBand business recorded net positive growth in 2021 in the customer base of 40
thousand users, +6.1% on December 31, 2020. In addition, the customer base continues to be
concentrated on high-speed connections, with more than 50% exceeding 100Mbps.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA in 2021 was 8,661 million reais (8,282 million reais in 2020, +4.6%) and the margin on
revenues was stable at 48.0%.

EBITDA in 2021 reflects the non-recurring charges of 36 million reais (27 million euros in 2020),
mainly related to the development of non-recurring projects.

Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring items, increased by 4.7% and was calculated as follows:

(million Brazilian reais) 2021 2020 Changes

Non-recurring expenses/(income) 36 27 9
ORGANIC EBITDA - excluding non-recurring items 8,697 8,309 388 4.7

The increase of EBITDA is due to the increase in revenue and cost control efficiency.

The relative margin on revenues, in organic terms, comes to 48.2% (48.1% in 2020).

EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021, amounted to 2,429 million reais, up 4.0% compared to the
fourth quarter of 2020 (2,336 million reais).

    - **_Main Changes in the scope of consolidation of the TIM Group_**

**_Introduction_**

The TIM Group and TIM S.p.A. Consolidated Financial Statements for the year 2021 and the
comparative figures for the previous year have been prepared in compliance with the IFRS issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union ( "IFRS").

The accounting policies and consolidation principles adopted are consistent with those applied for the
TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements and the TIM S.p.A. Separate Financial Statements at
December 31, 2020, except for the amendments to the standards issued by IASB and adopted starting
from January 1, 2021.

TIM Group, in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by the IFRS,
uses certain alternative performance measures in order to present a better understanding of the trend of
operations and financial condition. Specifically, these alternative performance measures refer to:
EBITDA; EBIT; organic change and impact of non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT;
EBITDA margin and EBIT margin; and net financial debt carrying amount and adjusted net financial
debt; Equity Free Cash Flow. Following the adoption of IFRS 16, the TIM Group also presents the
following additional alternative performance measures:

    - EBITDA adjusted After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic
EBITDA, net of the non-recurring items, from the amounts connected with the accounting
treatment of the lease contracts according to IFRS 16;

    - Adjusted net financial debt After Lease, calculated by excluding from the adjusted net
financial debt the net liabilities related to the accounting treatment of lease contracts
according to IFRS 16;

    - Equity Free Cash Flow After Lease, calculated by excluding from the Equity Free Cash
Flow the amounts related to lease payments.

In line with the ESMA guidance on alternative performance measures (Guidelines ESMA/2015/1415),
the meaning and contents of such are explained in the Chapter on “Alternative performance measures”
and the analytical detail of the amounts of the reclassifications introduced and of the methods for
determining indicators is provided.

Lastly, the section entitled "Business Outlook for the year 2022" contains forward-looking statements
in relation to the TIM Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations regarding financial
performance and other aspects of the Group's operations and strategies. Readers of this Annual
Financial Report are reminded not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements; in fact, actual
results may differ significantly from forecasts owing to risks and uncertainties depending on numerous
factors, the majority of which are beyond the scope of the TIM Group’s control. Please refer to the

To regulate the commercial relationship between TIM and FiberCop and ensure continuity of operations
and consolidation of its processes, TIM and FiberCop signed a number of agreements, including: the
Master Service Agreement which governs the provision of services provided to TIM and FiberCop and
vice versa; the IRU Master Agreement which governs FiberCop’s grant to TIM of the right to use all

migration of the customer base from copper to fiber optic and the development of the horizontal FTTH
network; FiberCop has made commitments to purchase the primary network and the construction and
maintenance services from TIM.

In connection with these commitments, the agreements envisage penalties applicable to either party if
they should not be respected, and rights in the favor of Teemo BidCo, as minority shareholder, to protect
against any failure by TIM to execute the contractual commitments made; this is all in line with standard
market practice.

These penalties charged to the parties and rights of the minority shareholder are assessed when drafting
the financial statements and subject to reconsideration at each accounting end date.

**_Establishment of Noovle_**

Starting January 1, 2021, the conferral is effective to Noovle of the TIM business unit comprising the
assets and liabilities and employees involved in the supply of services for the Cloud and Edge
Computing business and the rent of spaces, including virtual, also offered through a dedicated network
of data centers.

**_The transaction_**

With the aim of extending its leadership in cloud services, seizing the business opportunities presented
by the market and maximizing efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in terms of overall security,
TIM has decided to concentrate its assets and skills in the cloud area, that were previously spread among
several of TIM's departments, into a single company. Also in business terms, the transaction is the
outcome of a collaboration agreement with Google Cloud (a partnership signed in the first quarter of
2020) for the creation of innovative public, private and hybrid cloud services to enrich TIM's offer of
technological services.


-----

The transaction ensures a strong focus on that sector and favors an acceleration of cloud sales on the
market as well as an effective and efficient management of the partial migration of the computational
workloads of TIM's IT to the public cloud, guaranteeing the optimization of infrastructure and
operations.

The transaction also allows the further development of skills in the cloud area and the achievement of
major sustainability objectives.

**_Operation structure_**

The transaction took the form of a contribution in kind, pursuant to Art. 2343 ter, second paragraph,
letter b) of the Italian Civil Code, of a TIM business complex to Noovle, a company set up and wholly
controlled by TIM for this purpose and subject to its management and coordination.

The conferral involved the assignment to the transferee company of a business unit consisting of assets,
liabilities, contracts of purchase and sale, employees and anything else intended for and attributable to
the provision i) of services relating to the cloud business, including ICT services to be supplied to TIM
itself, and ii) the rental of spaces, including virtual ones, also offered through a dedicated network of
data centers.

**_Agreements with TIM signed under the scope of the conferral_**

With a view to ensuring the homogeneous management of the commercial relationship with TIM and
to guaranteeing continuity of operations and consolidation of its processes, early 2021, Noovle signed
various agreements with the parent company, in particular:

    - the two Master Service Agreements, signed on February 19, 2021, regulate on the one hand,
the Services supplied by Noovle to the TIM client (including Site Management Services,
Proximity services, Assurance; Security Management, Architecture & Engineering
Services, Operating Governance Services, Demand Management, Infrastructure and
Project Delivery, System Development & Management, COE – Centers of Excellence,
Offering, Supply and Conditioning Services, Systems Management/Discovery Operations)
and, on the other, the Services supplied by TIM in connection with the operative needs of
Noovle, also in order to assure consistency with the TIM Group’s processes;

    - under the scope of the carve out, Noovle was also conferred the specific project agreements
of the TIM-Google partnership. The specified collaboration agreement with Google Cloud,
signed by TIM in February 2020, is in fact structured into a main agreement and specific
project contracts.

    - Non-recurring events

In the years 2021 and 2020, the TIM Group recognized non-recurring net operating expenses connected
to events and transactions that by their nature do not occur on an ongoing basis in the normal course of
operations and which have been shown because their amount is significant. Non-recurring charges

Specifically, non-recurring events for the year 2021 included:

    - 4,120 million euros for the impairment loss on Goodwill attributed to the Domestic Cash
Generating Unit (CGU). The impairment test, carried out when drawing up the 2021
Financial Statements, was performed by referring to the flows of the 2022 - 2024 Industrial
Plan and the projections up to 2026 of the CGU in its current conditions, and using a
discount rate updated to the financial market conditions as at December 31, 2021. The
2022-2024 Industrial Plan is based on the results of the 2021 final accounting, reflects
realistic expectations on future developments and outlines all the actions to create value for
the shareholders. The impairment loss seen during the year is entirely due to goodwill;

    - 735 million euros in other operating expenses, mainly referring to provisions made for
disputes, transactions, regulatory sanctions and related potential liabilities as well as
expenses connected with the COVID-19 emergency for provisions made as a consequence
of the worsening of the expected credit losses of Corporate customers, connected with the
expected evolution of the pandemic.

Other operating expenses - Sundry expenses and provisions include 548 million euros for the posting
of a Contractual Risk Provision for Onerous Contracts (IAS 37) relating to ongoing relations with
some counterparties for the offer of multimedia content.

In particular, they include the accrual of the Net Present Value of the negative margin connected
with some partnerships, including the one in place between TIM and DAZN for the offer in Italy on
the TIMVISION platform of DAZN content, including all matches of the Serie A football
championship for the seasons 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024.

In greater detail, as part of the definition of the 2022-2024 strategic plan, the business plan
hypotheses have been updated for the current football season and the next two, pointing out that the
total margins of the project, including TIM’s contractual commitments towards DAZN in terms of
fees, for lack of remedy by DAZN of certain breaches already disputed, is very much negative.

Use of said Provision throughout the contractual term will make it possible to offset the negative
item of the margin (EBITDA), thereby obtaining null EBIT (organic or operative margin) for the
DAZN offer contents sale business.

With specific regard to the Contractual Risk Provision for Onerous Contracts relating to content, the
financial reports for future years and throughout the life of the contract will indicate:

    - the amount used of the Provision for risks covering the negative margin;

##### Consolidated operating performance

###### Revenues

Total TIM Group revenues for the year 2020 amounted to 15,805 million euros, down -12.1% compared to the
year 2019 (17,974 million euros); organic change in total revenues was -6.4%.

The breakdown of total revenues for the year 2020 by operating segment in comparison with 2019 is as follows:

(million euros) 2020 2019 Changes

organic %

% weight % weight absolute % excluding non
recurring

Domestic 12,905 81.7 14,078 78.3 (1,173) (8.3) (7.7)

Consolidated Total 15,805 100.0 17,974 100.0 (2,169) (12.1) (6.4)

The organic change in the Group’s consolidated revenues for the year 2020 is calculated by excluding the
negative effect of exchange rate cha[1] of -990 million euros, the changes in the scope of consolidation[2] for -64
million euros as well as non-recurring items. The adjustments of non-recurring revenues recorded in 2020 (-39
million euros) are connected to the commercial initiatives of TIM S.p.A. to support customers to deal with the
COVID-19 emergency, while 2019 was affected by non-recurring charges of 15 million euros relating to
adjustments to revenues from previous years.

The company Noovle S.r.l. and its subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis since the date on which
control was acquired by the TIM Group (May 21, 2020). If the acquisition of Noovle S.r.l had been completed on
January 1, 2020, the TIM Group would have posted higher revenues for approximately 14 million euros with
insignificant effects on the profit (loss) for the year.

Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 amounted to 4,148 million euros, with an organic change compared
to the fourth quarter 2019 of -90 million euros (-2.1%).

###### EBITDA

TIM Group EBITDA for the year 2020 came to 6,739 million euros (8,151 million euros in the year 2019, -17.3%; 5.9% in organic terms).

The breakdown of EBITDA and the EBITDA margin broken down by operating segment for 2020 compared with
2019, are as follows:

Total employee benefits expenses 2,639 3,077 (438)

_% of Revenues_ _16.7_ _17.1_ _(0.4) pp_

The net decrease of 438 million euros was mainly driven by:

   - a decrease of 160 million euros of ordinary Employee benefits expenses in the Italian component,
essentially due to the benefits deriving from a reduction in the average salaried workforce amounting to
a total of -2,490 average employees;

   - a decrease of 193 million euros of “restructuring and other expenses” in the Italian component. In 2020,
charges were set aside amounting to 74 million euros mainly related to the effective exits of the Parent
Company in the year 2020 (also through the application of art. 4 of Italian Law no. 92 of June 28, 2012,
as defined in the Trade Union Agreement of February 26, 2019 and the Trade Union Agreement signed
June 4, 2020) and to the provision made for exits based on the application of art. 4 of Italian Law no. 92
of June 28, 2012 following the agreements signed with trade unions on April 22, 2020 by Olivetti and
Telecom Italia Trust Technologies, and on April 17, 2020 by Telecontact. In 2019, provisions were recorded
for expenses totaling 267 million euros following the updated provisions related to the application of art.
4 of Italian Law no. 92 of June 28, 2012, for both the Parent Company and the other subsidiary companies.

   - for 85 million euros, the decrease in the foreign component mainly related to the impact of the exchange
rate change and lower non-recurring charges of the Brazil Business Unit.

The decrease is mainly attributable to the Brazil Business Unit; in fact, other operating income in the year 2019
benefited from 685 million euros from the Brazil Business Unit (classified as non-recurring), connected with the
recognition of tax credits consequent to the favorable result of the tax disputes connected to the inclusion of the
ICMS indirect tax in the basis of calculation of the taxes on PIS and COFINS revenues.

The decrease is mainly attributable to the Domestic Business Unit (-460 million euros) and to the Brazil Business
Unit (-205 million euros, of which approximately -130 million euros linked to exchange rate dynamics).

Other operating expenses for the year 2020 include a non-recurring item of 148 million euros, mainly referring to
provisions and expenses connected with credit management in connection with the COVID-19 emergency (46
million euros), charges for regulatory sanctions and expenses related to agreements and the development of
non-recurring projects. In particular, in relation to credit management, it is noted that the macroeconomic
scenario with a sharp reduction in GDP caused by the pandemic worsened the Expected Credit Loss of some of
the customers. Consequently, the provision for bad debt was adjusted according to the expected loss differential.
With reference to the impairment and expenses connected with credit management, we note that the reduction
is the consequence of a program to optimize processes aimed at increasing the efficiency of credit management,
all round, intervening on the whole process involving the customer. More specifically, reference is made to the
acceptance, management and collection of debt through to the assessment model of the new commercial
offers.

The non-recurring component of 2019, amounting to 459 million euros, mainly referred to regulatory disputes
and related liabilities and to liabilities with customers and/or suppliers.

Depreciation and amortization

Amounts to 4,616 million euros (4,927 million euros in 2019) and breaks down as follows:

(million euros) 2020 2019 Changes

Total 4,616 4,927 (311)

Net impairment losses on non-current assets

In 2020, the item shows losses of 8 million euros (zero in 2019), mainly following the provisions made by the
Parent Company TIM S.p.A for inventory differences for plant warehouse materials held at external company
sites.

In preparing the Annual Report for 2020, the TIM Group carried out an impairment test on goodwill. The results
of that testing, carried out in accordance with the specific procedure adopted by the Group, confirmed the
amounts of Goodwill allocated to the Group’s individual Cash Generating Units.

Further details are provided in the Note “Goodwill” to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31,
2020 of the TIM Group.

million euros in the fourth quarter of 2019).

Exchange rate fluctuations mainly related to the Brazil Business Unit.

Other income (expenses) from investments

Other income (expenses) from investments amounted to 454 million euros and refer to:

- 441 million euros of net capital gain recognized following the dilution of the TIM Group investment in INWIT
S.p.A. capital from 60% to 37.5%, following the merger of INWIT with Vodafone Towers;

- 11 million euros of capital gains deriving from the sale, during the year, of shares for a total of 7.3% of the
share capital of INWIT, through an accelerated book-building procedure reserved to institutional investors
and sales to an SPV managed and assisted by Canson Capital Partners (Guernsey) Limited;

- 2 million euros relating to income distributed by the Northgate CommsTech Innovations Partners L.P. fund.

Balance of finance income/(expenses)

Financial income (expenses), net was negative and amounted to 1,179 million euros (negative 1,436 million euros
in the year 2019): the improvement was mainly driven by lower finance expenses, connected to the reduction in
the Group’s average debt exposure and a drop in interest rates, as well as the positive effects of the change of
some non-monetary items, of a currency and accounting nature, relating to the measurement of derivative
instruments at fair value.

Income tax expense

Lower tax income of 5,955 million euros were recorded in 2020 (taxes of 513 million euros in the year 2019).

Tax proceeds mainly relate to the recording of deferred tax assets as a consequence of the tax recognition of
higher amounts booked in accordance with Decree Law 104/2020, Art. 110, paragraph 8 and 8 bis (5,877 million
euros) for more details see the note on “Income tax (current and deferred)” of the TIM Group Consolidated
financial statements as at December 31, 2020. The item also benefited from the positive tax effect due to the
lower taxes paid in previous years and generated following the ruling signed on August 3, 2020 with the Italian
Revenues Agency for application of the “patent box” facilitation in income tax and IRAP (regional production tax)
tax returns for TIM S.p.A. for the years 2015 - 2019 (299 million euros).

In 2019, “income tax expenses” included, amongst others, 233 million euros of tax expense related to the
recognition of deferred taxation relating to non-recurring operating income of the Brazil Business Unit.

Mobile market, the restrictions related to the COVID-19 emergency. Organic revenues, net of the non-recurring
component, amounted to 12,944 million euros (-1,081 million euros compared to 2019, -7.7%); in particular,
revenues for 2020 were affected by an overall impact of -39 million euros mainly referring to adjustments of
revenues connected to TIM S.p.A.’s commercial initiatives to support customers in facing the COVID-19
emergency. In 2019, non-recurring charges for 15 million euros were recorded, attributable to revenue
adjustments of previous years.

Domestic Business Unit revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 amounted to 3,433 million euros, down by 122
million euros compared to the same period of 2019 (-3.4%, -3.0% in organic terms).

Revenues from stand-alone services amounted to 11,605 million euros (-980 million euros compared to 2019, 7.8%) and reflect the impacts of the regulatory and competitive context on the customer base and ARPU levels.
Revenues from organic stand-alone services, net of the aforesaid non-recurring components, amounted to
11,643 million euros (-883 million euros compared to 2019, -7.0%).

In detail:

- revenues from stand-alone Fixed market services amounted to 8,785 million euros in organic terms, with
a change with respect to 2019 (-6.1%) mainly due to the decrease in accesses and ARPU levels, which is
also reflected in the trend of revenues from broadband services (-170 million euros compared to 2019, 6.9%), partly offset by the growth in revenues from ICT solutions (+134 million euros compared to 2019,
amounting to +15.6%);

- revenues from mobile market stand-alone services amounted to 3,378 million euros (-397 million euros
compared to 2019, -10.5%) and were affected by the negative impact, on the customer base, of the changed
competitive dynamics as well as the effects related to the regulatory environment and those resulting from
the limitations imposed on health emergencies. In organic terms, net of the aforesaid non-recurring
component, revenues from Mobile stand-alone services amounted to 3,411 million euros (-330 million euros
compared to 2019, equal to -8.8%).
Handset and Bundle & Handset revenues, including the changes to work in progress, amounted to 1,301 million
euros in 2020, -198 million euros in organic terms compared to 2019, also due to reduced footfall in sales outlets
following the restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 emergency.

and show a trend (-686 million euros, -10.4%), compared to 2019, affected by the challenging competition
and greater discipline in commercial processes. The trend seen in total revenues also applied to revenues
from stand-alone services, which amounted to 5,181 million euros, down by 619 million euros compared to
2019 (-10.7%). In particular:

   - revenues from Mobile stand-alone services totaled, in organic terms, 2,343 million euros (-226 million
euros, -8.8%) compared to 2019; against the backdrop of an unprecedented competitive dynamic at the
lower end of the market, there was a more contained reduction in the calling customer base in the fourth
quarter. These results also take into account the effects of the COVID-19 emergency on roaming
revenues and the gradual reduction of regulated interconnection tariffs on incoming traffic;

   - revenues from Fixed stand-alone services totaled, in organic terms, 2,871 million euros (-382 million
euros, -11.7% compared to 2019), primarily due to lower ARPU levels and the smaller Customer Base,
which declined gradually over the course of 2020. The number of broadband customers, particularly
UltraBroadBand, grew, and an improvement was achieved in the 2020 performance compared to 2019
of broadband ARPU starting from the third quarter.
Revenues for Handsets and Bundles & Handsets in the Consumer segment amounted to 727 million euros, -67
million euros compared to 2019 (-8.4%), concentrated on the mobile sector following the change in the product
sales strategy, focused on protecting margins. The restrictions on circulation due to the COVID-19 health
emergency also had an impact on performance: during the lockdown, the volume of smartphones sold fell
compared to 2019 and only recovered to normal levels in July.

- Business: the segment consists of voice, data, and Internet services and products, and ICT solutions
managed and developed for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), Small Offices/Home Offices
(SOHOs), Top customers, the Public Sector, Large Accounts, and Enterprises in the Fixed and Mobile
telecommunications markets. The following companies are included: Olivetti, TI Trust Technologies and Telsy
and, starting June 2020, the Noovle Group. In organic terms, net of the aforesaid non-recurring component,
revenues for the Business segment amounted to 4,113 million euros (-512 million euros compared to 2019, 11.1%, of which -8.1% for revenues from the stand-alone services component). In particular:

   - total Mobile market revenues showed an organic performance compared to 2019 (-11.8%), linked to the
revenues from stand-alone services component (-11.8%) and the ARPU trend;

   - total Fixed market revenues in organic terms changed by -386 million euros compared to 2019 (-10.7%),
with the revenues from services component (-6.8%) influenced by a price trend partly offset by higher
revenues from ICT services.

- National Wholesale Market: the segment consists of the management and development of the portfolio of
regulated and unregulated wholesale services for Fixed-line and Mobile telecommunications operators in
the domestic market. The following companies are included: TI San Marino and Telefonia Mobile
Sammarinese. The National Wholesale Market segment revenues in 2020 came to 1,917 million euros, up by
74 million euros (+4.0%) compared to 2019, with a positive performance mainly driven by the growth in
accesses in the Ultra Broadband segment.

- International Wholesale Market: includes the activities of the Telecom Italia Sparkle group, which operates
in the market for international voice, data and Internet services for fixed and mobile telecommunications
operators, ISPs/ASPs (Wholesale market) and multinational companies through its own networks in the
European, Mediterranean and South American markets. Revenues for the International Wholesale Market
segment for 2020 totaled 966 million euros, showing growth of 19 million euros (+2.0%) on the 2019 figure,
with negligible effects on EBITDA. This performance is mainly related to the data business capacity offer.

- Other: includes:

   - INWIT S.p.A.: operates in the electronic communications infrastructure sector, specifically relating to
infrastructure for housing radio transmission equipment for mobile telephone networks, both for TIM and
other operators. In 2020, the TIM Group's equity investment in INWIT recorded various changes due to
the multiple transactions involving the corporate structure, starting with the merger by incorporation of
Vodafone Towers S.r.l. into INWIT S.p.A. Further details are provided in the Note on “Equity investments”
in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the TIM Group at December 31, 2020. INWIT S.p.A. was
presented as "Asset held for sale" from the Consolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2019
and until the completion of the aforementioned merger.

   - Other Operations units: covering technological innovation and development, engineering, construction
and operating processes for network infrastructures, IT, real estate properties and plant engineering; the
Flash Fiber company and Open Access operations connected with delivery and assurance of customer
services are also included, until September 2019 included in the Wholesale segment and then

The increase of 87 million euros reflects the effect of the deconsolidation of the company INWIT as of March 31,
2020 and the consequent start of the new Master Service Agreement (MSA) with that company. Excluding these
impacts, the item Acquisition of goods and services would show a reduction of 126 million euros, above all in
purchases for resale, due to the decrease in volumes sold of mobile terminals, in line with the ongoing
repositioning of commercial strategies. The reduction was also affected by restrictions related to the COVID-19
emergency, especially in the mobile area.

- Employee benefits expenses amounted to 2,401 million euros with a decrease of 352 million euros

Total 639 1,099 (460)

Other operating expenses for the year 2020 include a non-recurring item of 148 million euros, mainly referring
to provisions and expenses connected with credit management in connection with the COVID-19 emergency (46
million euros), charges for regulatory sanctions and expenses related to agreements and the development of
non-recurring projects. In particular, in relation to credit management, it is noted that the macroeconomic
scenario with a sharp reduction in GDP caused by the pandemic worsened the Expected Credit Loss of some of
the customers. Consequently, the provision for bad debt was adjusted according to the expected loss differential.
With reference to the impairment and expenses connected with credit management, we note that the reduction
is the consequence of a program to optimize processes aimed at increasing the efficiency of credit management,
all round, intervening on the whole process involving the customer. More specifically, reference is made to the
acceptance, management and collection of debt through to the assessment model of the new commercial
offers.
The non-recurring component of 2019, amounting to 416 million euros, mainly referred to regulatory disputes
and related liabilities and to liabilities with customers and/or suppliers.

The Brazil Business Unit (TIM Brasil group) provides mobile telephony services using UMTS, GSM and LTE
technologies. Moreover, the Tim Brasil Group offers fiber optic data transmission using full IP technology, such as
DWDM and MPLS and residential broadband services.

On December 15, 2020, TIM announced that the offer presented by TIM S.A. (the operating company of the TIM
Brasil Group) together with Telefônica Brasil S.A. (VIVO) and Claro S.A., had been awarded the contract in the
competitive sale process for the purchase of the Oi Group’s mobile business. The completion of the transaction,
expected in 2021, is in any case subject to the fulfilment of the same conditions precedent provided for in the
agreements and the authorizations of the competent Authorities.

The total value of the transaction amounts to 16.5 billion reais (approximately 2.7 billion euros) which is summed
with the consideration offered to the Oi Group, of approximately 819 million reais (about 134 million euros), as
net present value (NPV) for the Take-or-Pay Data Transmission Capacity Contracts. TIM Brasil will participate in
the transaction with an investment of approximately 7.3 billion reais (approximately 1.2 billion euros), to be paid

at closing, and 476 million reais relating to TIM Brasil’s share of the net present value (NPV) of the contracts.
Given the low debt and the favorable market conditions, TIM S.A. believes it can finance the acquisition through
cash and the local debt market. However, in the event of any changes in market conditions, TIM S.A. will evaluate
all available options.

The purchase plan provides for TIM Brasil, Telefônica Brasil and Claro to divide up Oi’s mobile assets and, in
particular, its customers, radio frequencies and mobile access infrastructure.

In particular, TIM Brasil will be allocated:

- approximately 14.5 million customers (corresponding to 40% of UPI Ativos Móveis’ total customer base),
according to Anatel’s data of April 2020. The allocation took into consideration criteria that favor competition
among the operators present in the Brazilian market;

- approximately 49 MHz as a national average weighted by population (54% of UPI Ativos Móveis radio
frequencies). The division of frequencies strictly respects the spectrum limits per group established by Anatel;

- approximately 7.2 thousand mobile access sites (corresponding to 49% of total UPI Ativos Móveis sites).

The transaction, as of its completion, will add value not only to its Brazilian subsidiary but to the whole TIM Group
and its shareholders as it will accelerate its growth and increase operating efficiency through relevant synergies.
In addition, positive effects are also expected for customers, since improvements in user experience and in the
quality of the services offered are expected from the transaction. Finally, the transaction is expected to benefit
the entire telecommunications sector in South America, which will be strengthened in its investment capacity,
technological innovation, as well as its competitiveness.

In December 2020 the Board of Directors of TIM S.A. approved the formation of a company, in preparation for
future segregation of assets and provision of fiber infrastructure services. This process is one of the intermediate
steps in the transformation of TIM in the provision of broadband services and aims to create an open fiber
infrastructure company attracting a strategic partner that will become a shareholder. The infrastructure
company will operate in the wholesale market and providing fiber connectivity services for last-mile and
transport network, for all market operators, with TIM S.A. as an anchor customer. This transaction aims to
accelerate the growth of the residential broadband business and unlock the value of TIM's infrastructure.

###### Revenues
Revenues for the year 2020 of the Brazil Business Unit (TIM Brasil Group) totaled 17,268 million reais (17,377 million
reais in 2019, -0.6%).

Revenues from services totaled 16,665 million reais (+68 million reais compared to the 16,597 million reais in
2019, +0.4%).
Revenues from product sales totaled 603 million reais (780 million reais in 2019). The trend reflects the impact
of closure for two to three months in most of Brazil due to the COVID-19 emergency. The sales policy is still
focused more on value than on increasing sales volumes. In particular, the main goals of the new strategy are to
increase purchases of new connected devices giving TIM customers access to broadband services on 3G/4G
networks and to support new retention offerings for higher-value postpaid customers.

Revenues in Q4 2020 totaled 4,678 million reais, increased by 2.0% on the fourth quarter of 2019 (4,586 million
reais).

The mobile ARPU for 2020 was 24.9 reais, up from the figure recorded in 2019 (23.7 reais) thanks to general
repositioning in the post-paid segment and new commercial initiatives intended to promote the use of data and
average expenditure per customer.

The total number of lines as of December 31, 2020 amounted to 51.4 million, -3.0 million compared to December
31, 2019 (54.4 million). The change is entirely attributable to the prepaid segment (-3.4 million) and partially
offset by growth in the postpaid segment (+0.4 million), in part due to the consolidation underway in the market
for second SIM cards. Post-paid customers represented 42.4% of the customer base as of December 31, 2020,
3.0 percentage points higher than at December 2019 (39.4%).

###### EBITDA

EBITDA in 2020 was 8,282 million reais (10,820 million reais in 2019) and the margin on revenues was 48.0%
(62.3% in 2019).
The EBITDA in 2019 benefited from non-recurring net income of 2,760 million reais as the balance of 3,024 million
reais of income related to the recognition of tax credits following the favorable outcome of tax disputes relating
to the inclusion of the ICMS indirect tax in the basis for calculating the PIS/COFINS contribution and 264 million
reais of non-recurring charges for provisions mainly for regulatory disputes and related liabilities, as well as for


-----

liabilities with customers and/or suppliers, in addition to liabilities in respect of customers and/or suppliers and
charges connected with company reorganization/restructuring.

EBITDA in 2020 reflects the non-recurring charges of 27 million reais mainly related to agreements and the
development of non-recurring projects.

Organic EBITDA, net of the non-recurring component, increased by 3.1% and was calculated as follows:

(millions of reais) 2020 2019 Changes

Non-recurring expenses (income) 27 (2,760) 2,787

ORGANIC EBITDA - excluding Non-recurring items 8,309 8,060 249 3.1

The growth is attributable to the improvement in the efficiency of the operating expenses structure during the
COVID-19 emergency.
The respective margin on revenues stood at 48.1%, an increase in organic terms of 1.7 percentage points
compared to 2019.

EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 2,336 million reais, increased by 38 million euros compared with the
fourth quarter of 2019.

#### CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS PERFORMANCE

##### Non-current assets

- Goodwill: decreased by 236 million euros, from 23,083 million euros at December 31, 2019 to 22,847 million
euros at December 31, 2020, principally due to the effect of the negative exchange difference relative to the
goodwill of the Brazil Business Unit[1] (-247 million euros). During 2020, there was also an increase of 11 million
euros due to the acquisition of control and related consolidation with the integral method, starting from May
21, 2020, of Noovle S.r.l. and its subsidiaries (Domestic Business Unit).

Further details are provided in the Note "Goodwill" to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December
31, 2020 of the TIM Group.

- Intangible assets with a finite useful life: these fell by 927 million euros, from 7,667 million euros at the end
of 2019 to 6,740 million euros at December 31, 2020, representing the balance of the following items:

   - capex (+ 1,197 million euros);

   - amortization charge for the year (-1,627 million euros);

   - other disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net negative balance of -497 million euro,
of which -496 million euro of exchange differences essentially relating to the Brazil Business Unit).

- Tangible assets: these fell by 870 million euros, from 14,011 million euros at the end of 2019 to 13,141 million
euros at December 31, 2020, representing the balance of the following items:

   - capex (+2,138 million euros);

   - amortization charge for the year (-2,301 million euros);

   - other disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a net negative balance of -707 million euro,
of which -701 million euro of exchange differences essentially relating to the Brazil Business Unit).

- Rights of use of third-party assets: these fell by 502 million euros, from 5,494 million euros at the end of
2019 to 4,992 million euros at December 31, 2020, representing the balance of the following items:

   - investments (+74 million euros) and increases in lease contracts (+1,288 million euros). Increases in lease
contracts include 368 million euros, related to the recognition of new rights of use of INWIT S.p.A. assets,
following the coming into effect on March 31, 2020 of the new Master Service Agreement (MSA) between
TIM S.p.A. and INWIT S.p.A. (now jointly controlled), which regulates hospitality services on INWIT sites;

   - amortization charge for the year (-688 million euros);

   - disposals, exchange differences and other changes (for a negative net balance of -1,176 million euros)
including the derecognition of rights of use relative to previous lease agreements stipulated with
Vodafone, equal to 266 million euros, as a result of the new Master Service Agreement (MSA) between
TIM S.p.A. and INWIT S.p.A. coming into effect. Exchange differences are negative for -466 million euros
and mainly relate to the Brazil Business Unit. Other changes included the lower value of the rights of use
recorded as a result of contractual changes during the year.

- Other non-current assets: increased by 8,961 million euros mainly due to the booking by the Parent
Company TIM S.p.A. of deferred tax assets following the tax recognition of higher values booked in
accordance with Decree Law 104/2020, Art. 110, paragraph 8 and 8 bis (6,569 million euros). Other noncurrent assets increased also due to the recording of the investment in the joint venture INWIT (2,713 million
euros at December 31, 2020), following its deconsolidation as a result of the dilution by the TIM Group of the
investment in the company’s capital, consequent to the merger by incorporation of Vodafone Towers S.r.l.
into INWIT.

1The spot exchange rate used for the translation into euro of the Brazilian real (expressed in terms of units of local currency per 1 euro) was 6.3768 at
December 31, 2020 and 4.52808 at December 31, 2019.

In addition to what has already been described with reference to EBITDA, the change in adjusted net financial
debt for the first half of 2020 was particularly impacted by the following:

###### Capital expenditures and for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum

Capex amounted to 3,409 million euros in 2020 (3,784 million euros in 2019).

Capital expenditures and for mobile telephone licenses/spectrum are broken down by operating segment as
follows:

(million euros) 2020 2019 Changes
% weight % weight

Consolidated Total 3,409 100.0 3,784 _100.0_ (375)

_% of Revenues_ _21.6_ _21.1_ _0.5pp_

In particular:

- the Domestic Business Unit posted investments of 2,748 billion euros, -164 million euros, -107 million euros
in organic terms, compared to FY 2019, with a view to optimizing processes, particularly as a result of the
restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 emergency;

- the Brazil Business Unit reported expenditures equal to 661 million euros in 2020 (872 million euros in 2019).
Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates (-218 million euros), capex grew by 7 million euros, mainly
to strengthen the mobile UltraBroadBand infrastructure and the development of the fixed broadband
business of TIM Live.

###### Change in net operating working capital

The change in Net operating working capital for FY 2020 reflects a positive change of 772 million euros, mainly
as a consequence of the change in trade receivables (+484 million euros) and other changes in operating
receivables/payables (+571 million euros).

###### Change in provisions for employee benefits

These reduce by a total of 628 million euros, primarily due to redundancies and the reclassification to payables
of amounts not yet liquidated in relation to redundancy plans, already provisioned during previous years. Further
details are provided in the Note on “Provisions for employee benefits” in the Consolidated Financial Statements
of the TIM Group at December 31, 2020.

###### Sale of investments and other disposals flow

In FY 2020, this is positive for 1,294 million euros and mainly benefits from the deconsolidation of INWIT S.p.A.,
as well as collections deriving from sales by the TIM Group of INWIT shares  totaling approximately 7.3% of the
share capital. Further details are provided in the Note “Equity investments” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements at December 31, 2020 of the TIM Group.

|(million euros) 2020 % weight|2019 Changes % weight|

|% of Revenues 21.6|21.1 0.5pp|


-----

In FY 2019, the flow was positive for 160 million euros and mainly referred to the sale of Persidera S.p.A. (142
million euros), as well as to other sales of equity investments and to disposals of non-current assets taking place
within the normal operating cycle.

###### Share capital increases/reimbursements, including incidental costs

In FY 2020, the flow is positive for 1,164 million euros, mainly as a consequence of the contribution made by
shareholders outside the Group to the share capital increases of subsidiaries. More specifically, they include the
increase in capital of Daphne 3, a newly-established holding company controlled by TIM and in which TIM has
contributed a total of 30.2% of INWIT shares. With this share capital increase, the consortium of institutional
investors led by Ardian has taken its percentage stake held in Daphne 3 to 49%.

###### Increases in lease contracts

In FY 2020, the item amounted to 1,288 million euros (1,140 million euros in 2019).

Increases in lease contracts include the higher value of user rights entered following new lease agreements
payable, increases in lease payments and renegotiations of existing agreements.

In particular, in FY 2020 this includes 368 million euros, related to the recognition of new rights of use of INWIT
S.p.A. assets, following the new Master Service Agreement (MSA) between TIM S.p.A. and INWIT S.p.A. coming
into effect on March 31, 2020.

For further details, see the Note "Rights of use assets" of the Consolidated financial statements at December 31,
2020 of the TIM Group.

###### Financial expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating requirements flow

In 2020 the item had a total positive balance of 283 million euros. It mainly includes outflows relative to financial
management components, as well as the payment and reimbursement of income taxes and changes in nonoperating payables and receivables.

###### Sales of receivables to factoring companies

It should be noted that sales without recourse of trade receivables to factoring companies completed during
2020 resulted in a positive effect on the adjusted net financial debt at December 31, 2020 amounting to 1,970
million euros (1,958 million euros at December 31, 2019).

Following the request made by TIM S.p.A. for the Patent box benefit for the five-year period 2015-2019 and the
consequent agreement reached with the Revenue Agency for 2015 and that relating to complementary assets
for 2016-2019, the benefit of the tax periods 2015 and 2016 was cumulatively included in the IRES and IRAP
adjustment declarations for 2016, presented on September 25, 2020, while the benefit for the tax periods 2017
and 2018 was used in the IRES and IRAP declarations for the tax period 2019 send on December 10, 2020. In
particular, as regards the IRES, the greater 2016 credit of 123 million euros and the 2019 credit of 180 million euros
were requested as refund from the Revenue Agency in the related declarations and then transferred and
collected respectively on September 30, 2020 and December 21, 2020.

The financial risk management policies of the TIM Group are aimed at minimizing market risks, fully hedging
exchange rate risk and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate diversification of the portfolio,
which is also achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial instruments. Such instruments, it should
be stressed, are not used for speculative purposes and all have an underlying asset, which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the Group sets an optimum composition for the fixedrate and variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that composition.
Taking into account the Group's operating activities, the optimum mix of medium/long-term non-current
financial liabilities has been established, on the basis of the nominal amount, at a range of 65%–75% for the
fixed-rate component and 25%–35% for the variable-rate component.

In managing market risks, the Group has adopted Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial risk"
and mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual
indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted net
financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that some
components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and interest rate
for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result in actual
monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and non-monetary
effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of derivatives and
related financial assets/liabilities.

For further details, see the "Alternative performance indicators" chapter.

Adjusted net financial debt was 23,326 million euros as of December 31, 2020, 4,342 million euros lower than
on December 31, 2019 (27,668 million euros). The reduction was due in part to solid generation of free cash flow,
obtained in part by optimization of working capital, which allowed payment of dividends on ordinary and savings
shares of TIM S.p.A. for total 316 million euros (as compared with 166 million euros paid in 2019 to savings shares
only), payment of the installment for the 5G license (110 million euros), as well as the effects of the INWIT
transaction. In particular, with regard to INWIT we point out the deconsolidation of the company's debt (643
million euros compared to December 31, 2019) which broadly compensated for new debts for leases to INWIT,
now under joint control (368 million euros), after the ending of financial lease contracts with Vodafone (214
million euros), the collection of dividends (256 million euros, of which 214 million euros was in extraordinary
dividends) and the sale of 4.3% of the holding (400 million euros). On October 2, 2020, disposals were made by
TIM S.p.A. to Daphne 3 S.p.A. of 14.8% of the investment in INWIT (1,345 million euros) and to Canson of 1.2% of
the investment in INWIT (109 million euros). On December 4, 2020, following the exercise of an option maturing
at year-end, TIM S.p.A. sold the remaining share held in INWIT, equal to 1.8% (161 million euros) to Canson.
Therefore, following these transactions, as at December 31, 2020, INWIT was held 30.2% by Daphne 3 S.p.A., a
subsidiary held 51% by TIM S.p.A.

Additionally, following the request made by TIM S.p.A. for the Patent box benefit for the five years 2015-2019,
303 million euros has already been collected.

For a better understanding of the information, the table below shows the various ways by which the Net Financial
Debt can be shown:

Adjusted net financial debt - After Lease 18,594 21,893 (3,299)

Net financial debt carrying amount amounted to 23,714 million euros at December 31, 2020, a decrease of 4,532
million euros compared to December 31, 2019 (28,246 million euros). Reversal of the fair value measurement of
derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets recorded a change of 190 million euros compared to December
31, 2019 substantially following the fall in US dollar interest rates and the relevant revaluation of hedging on US
currency bonds. This change is adjusted by the booked Financial Debt with no monetary effect.

Adjusted Net Financial Debt – After Lease (net of the impact of all leases), which is a parameter adopted by
main European peers, was equal to 18,594 million euros at December 31, 2020, down by 3,299 million euros
compared to December 31, 2019 (21,893 million euros). The reduction is lower than shown in the Adjusted net
financial debt, as the effects of the deconsolidation/new payables due to IFRS 16 in relation to the INWIT
transaction, and the effects of the exchange rate on the payables due to IFRS 16 in Brazil, are not taken into
account.

On May 18, 2020 TIM created a new credit line, structured as a bridge to bond, for later issuing on the bond
market, for 1.7 billion euros and initially maturing after 12 months, with the option of extension for another 12
months.

On January 18, 2021, TIM issued its first 8-year Sustainability Bond for an amount of 1 billion euros, coupon
1.625%.

On January 19, 2021, TIM decided to totally cancel the unused 1.7 billion euro Bridge to Bond line.

_Maturities of financial liabilities and average cost of debt_

The average maturity of non-current financial liabilities (including the current portion of medium/long-term
financial liabilities due within 12 months) was 9.74 years.

The average cost of the Group’s debt, considered as the cost for the year calculated on an annual basis and
resulting from the ratio of debt-related expenses to average exposure, stood at approximately 3.7%, while the
average cost of the Group's debt "After Lease" was equal to approximately 3.4%.

For details on the maturities of financial liabilities in terms of expected nominal repayment amounts, as
contractually agreed, see the Notes “Financial liabilities (non-current and current)” in the Consolidated Financial
Statements at December 31, 2020 of the TIM Group.

_Current financial assets and liquidity margin_

The TIM Group’s available liquidity margin amounted to 12,621 million euros, equal to the sum of:

- “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Current securities other than investments” for a total of 5,921 million euros
(4,015 million euros at December 31, 2019);

- the totals for the Revolving Credit Facility, of 5,000 million euros, and the Bridge to Bond Facility, of 1,700
million euros, fully available.

This margin is sufficient to cover Group financial liabilities (current and otherwise) falling due over the next 30
months.

In particular:

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to 4,829 million euros (3,138 million euros at December 31, 2019). The
different technical forms of investing available cash can be analyzed as follows:

- maturities: investments have a maximum maturity of three months;

- counterparty risk: investments by the European companies are made with leading banking, financial and
industrial institutions with high credit quality. Investments by the companies in South America are made
with leading local counterparties;

- Country risk: deposits have been made mainly in major European financial markets.

Current securities other than investments amounted to 1,092 million euros (877 million euros at December 31,
2019): These forms of investment represent alternatives to the investment of liquidity with the aim of improving
returns. They included a total of 320 million euros of Italian and European treasury bonds held by Telecom Italia
Finance S.A., 447 million euros of bonds purchased by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. with different maturities, all
with an active market and consequently readily convertible into cash, and 325 million euros of investments in
monetary funds by the Brazil Business Unit. The purchases of the above government bonds, which, pursuant to
Consob Communication no. DEM/11070007 of August 5, 2011, represent investments in “Sovereign debt
securities”, have been made in accordance with the Guidelines for the "Management and control of financial
risk" adopted by the TIM Group.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, adjusted net financial debt amounted to 23,326 million euros, down by 2,143
million euros compared to September 30, 2020 (25,469 million euros): the improvement is due to positive cash
generation and the transaction involving the INWIT shares, described previously.

#### ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

In this Report on Operations, in the TIM Group Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Separate Financial
Statements of the Parent, TIM S.p.A., for the year ended December 31, 2020, in addition to the conventional
financial performance measures established by IFRS, certain alternative performance measures are presented
for a better understanding of the TIM Group performance of operations and financial position. Such measures,
which are presented in the periodical financial reports (annual and interim), should, however, not be considered
as a substitute for those required by IFRS.

In particular, following the adoption of IFRS 16, the TIM Group also presents the following additional alternative
performance indicators:

- EBITDA adjusted After Lease (“EBITDA-AL”), calculated by adjusting the Organic EBITDA, net of the nonrecurring items, from the amounts connected with the accounting treatment of the lease contracts
according to IFRS 16. This financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations
(business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It represents a useful unit of
measurement for the evaluation of the operating performance of the Group (as a whole and at the Business
Unit level) and of the Parent, TIM S.p.A., in addition to EBIT;

- Adjusted net financial debt After Lease, calculated by excluding from the adjusted net financial debt the
net liabilities related to the accounting treatment of lease contracts according to IFRS 16. TIM believes that
the Adjusted net financial debt After Lease represents an indicator of the ability to meet its financial
obligations;

- Equity Free Cash Flow After Lease, calculated by excluding from the Equity Free Cash Flow the amounts
related to lease payments. In particular, this measure is calculated as follows:

+ Equity Free Cash Flow

 - Principal share of lease charges

This financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business plans) and in
external presentations (to analysts and investors) and is a useful indicator of the ability to generate Free Cash
Flow.

The other alternative performance measures used are described below:

- EBITDA: this financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal presentations (business
plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It represents a useful unit of measurement
for the evaluation of the operating performance of the Group (as a whole and at the Business Unit level) and
of the Parent, TIM S.p.A., in addition to EBIT. These measures are calculated as follows:

Profit (loss) before tax from continuing operations

+ Finance expenses

 - Finance income

+/-   Other expenses (income) from investments (1)

+/-   Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method (2)

EBIT - Operating profit (loss)

+/-   Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets

+/-   Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets

+ Depreciation and amortization

EBITDA – Operating profit before depreciation and amortization, capital gains (losses) and impairment reversals (losses) on noncurrent assets

(1)“Expenses (income) from investments” for TIM S.p.A..

(2) Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.


-----

- Organic change and impact of the non-recurring items on revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these measures
express changes (amount and/or percentage) in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding, where applicable,
the effects of the change in the scope of consolidation, the exchange differences and the non-recurring
events and transactions. TIM believes that this method of presentation provides a more complete and
effective interpretation of the Group's operating performance (as a whole and with reference to the Business
Units) and of the Parent; it is therefore also used in the presentations to analysts and investors. This Report
on Operations provides a reconciliation between the “reported figure” and the “organic excluding the nonrecurring component” figure.

- EBITDA margin and EBIT margin: TIM believes that these margins represent useful indicators of the ability
of the Group, as a whole and at Business Unit level, and of the Parent to generate profits from its revenues.
In fact, EBITDA margin and EBIT margin measure the operating performance of an entity by analyzing the
percentage of revenues that are converted into EBITDA and EBIT, respectively. Such indicators are used by
TIM in internal presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors) in
order to illustrate the results from operations also through the comparison of the operating results of the
financial year being reported with those of the previous years.

- Net financial debt: TIM believes that the Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator of its ability to
meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and
other Financial Assets. The Report on Operations includes two tables showing the amounts taken from the
statements of financial position and used to calculate the Net Financial Debt of the Group and Parent.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual
indicator (renamed “Net financial debt carrying amount”), the TIM Group reports a measure called “Adjusted
net financial debt”, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial markets. Given that
some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for setting the exchange and
interest rate for contractual flows) and of derivatives embedded in other financial instruments do not result
in actual monetary settlement, the Adjusted net financial debt excludes these purely accounting and nonmonetary effects (including the effects of IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement) from the measurement of
derivatives and related financial assets/liabilities.

Net financial debt is calculated as follows:

+ Non-current financial liabilities

+ Current financial liabilities

+ Financial liabilities directly associated with Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

A) Gross financial debt

+ Non-current financial assets

+ Current financial assets

+ Financial assets relating to Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

B) Financial assets

C=(A - B) Net financial debt carrying amount

D) Reversal of fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial liabilities/assets

E=(C +D) Adjusted net financial debt

- Equity Free Cash Flow (EFCF): this financial measure is used by TIM as the financial target in internal
presentations (business plans) and external presentations (to analysts and investors), shows cash generation
and is intended as the net cash flow before payments relating to dividend and investments in frequencies.
Therefore, it represents the Free Cash Flow available for dividend payments, debt repayment, impacts of
leasing transactions and investment in frequencies. This measure excludes the financial impact of any
acquisition and/or disposal of equity investments.

The Equity Free Cash Flow measure is calculated as follows:

+ Operating Net Free Cash Flow

 - Impact for leasing

 - Payment of licenses

 - Financial impact of acquisitions and/or disposals of shareholdings

 - Dividend payment and Change in Equity
