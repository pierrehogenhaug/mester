The Dealers and the Trustee expressly do not undertake to review the financial condition or affairs of any of the Issuers or the Guarantor during the life of the Programme or to advise any investor in Notes issued under the Programme of any information coming to their attention. Investors should review, inter alia, the most recently published documents incorporated by reference into this EMTN Programme Prospectus when deciding whether or not to purchase any Notes. PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (EEA). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the Insurance Mediation Directive), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. MiFID II product governance / target market – The Final Terms in respect of any Notes will include a legend entitled ""MiFID II product governance"" which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a distributor) should take into consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the Product Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the MiFID Product Governance Rules), any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes, but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MIFID Product Governance Rules.

Factors beyond its control may prevent it from successfully implementing its strategy.,13.2.1,,"On 6 March 2018 TIM’s Board of Directors approved the Plan. The Plan provides for the digitalisation of all processes to dramatically enhance the digital experience for best-in-class customer engagement and to create an effective digital journey. Customer experience is expected to be improved by offering one single and intuitive interface that will allow for more customised, multi-channel interaction, thanks to renewed IT architecture. The above implies a fully digital model of relationship with the client, based on the use of the so-called “big data” and advanced analytics to sustain the customer base and capture new growth opportunities, contributing to the consolidation of TIM’s leadership in the fixed and mobile segments. TIM’s ability to implement and achieve its strategic objectives and priorities may be influenced by certain factors, including factors outside of its control. Such factors include: 1 CoSO Report-ERM Integrated Framework 2004. ----- - a deterioration of the economic environment in the principal markets in which TIM operates, including, in particular, its core Italian market; - the impact of regulatory decisions and changes in the regulatory environment in Italy, Brazil and other countries in which TIM operates; - the impact of political developments in Italy, Brazil and other countries in which TIM operates; - TIM’s ability to successfully compete on both price and innovation capabilities with respect to new products and services; - TIM’s ability to develop and introduce new technologies that are attractive in its principal markets, to manage innovation, to supply value added services and to increase the use of its fixed and mobile networks; - TIM’s ability to successfully implement its internet and broadband/ultrabroadband strategy; - TIM’s ability to successfully achieve its financial targets (including debt reduction); - the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates and the performance of the equity markets in general; - the outcome of litigation, disputes and investigations in which TIM is involved or may become involved; - TIM’s ability to build up its business in adjacent markets and in international markets (particularly in Brazil), due to its specialist and technical resources; - TIM’s ability to achieve the expected return on the investments and capital expenditures it has made and continues to make in Italy, Brazil and other countries in which it operates; - the amount and timing of any future impairment charges for TIM’s authorisations, goodwill or other assets; - TIM’s ability to manage any business or operating model transformation plans; - disruptions or uncertainties resulting from the United Kingdom’s expected exit from the EU; - any difficulties which TIM may encounter in its supply and procurement processes, including as a result of the insolvency or financial weaknesses of its suppliers; and - the costs TIM incurs due to unexpected events, in particular where its insurance is not sufficient to cover such costs. _As a result of these uncertainties there can be no assurance that the business and strategic objectives identified by TIM’s management can effectively be attained in the manner and within the time-frames described. Furthermore, if TIM is unable to attain its strategic priorities, its goodwill may be further impaired, which could result in further significant write-offs._ The following sets out more specific factors that may prevent TIM from achieving its objectives.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

There is a wide range of factors which individually or together could result in the Issuers or the Guarantor becoming unable to make all payments due. It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which factors are most likely to occur, as the Issuers and the Guarantor may not be aware of all relevant factors and certain factors which they currently deem not to be material may become material as a result of the occurrence of events outside of the Issuers’ and the Guarantor’s control. The Issuers and the Guarantor have identified in this EMTN Programme Prospectus, including in the information incorporated by reference herein (see “Documents Incorporated by Reference” below), a number of factors which could materially adversely affect their businesses and ability to make payments due. In addition, factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with Notes issued under the Programme are also described below.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

Operational risks related to its business, include those resulting from inadequate internal and external processes, fraud, employee errors, failure to document transactions properly, loss or disclosure of critical or commercial sensitive data or personal identification information and systems failures. These events could result in direct or indirect losses and adverse legal and regulatory proceedings, and could harm its reputation and operational effectiveness. ----- TIM has in place risk management procedures designed to detect, manage and monitor at a senior level the evolution of these operational risks. However, there is no guarantee that these measures will be successful in effectively controlling the operational risks that TIM faces and such failures could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and could harm its reputation.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

The New Equivalence Model, will improve the current equality of access guarantees",2052.1.1,TIM operates under authorisations granted by government authorities.,"Many of TIM’s activities require authorisations from governmental authorities both in Italy and abroad. These authorisations specify the types of services the operating company holding such authorisation may provide. The continued existence and terms of TIM’s authorisations are subject to review by regulatory authorities and to interpretation, modification or termination by these authorities. Although authorisation renewal is not usually guaranteed, most authorisations do address the renewal process and terms that may be affected by political and regulatory factors. Many of these authorisations are revocable for public interest reasons. In addition, its current authorisations to provide networks and services require that TIM satisfies certain obligations, including minimum specified quality levels, service and coverage conditions. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in the imposition of fines or even in the revocation or forfeiture of the authorisation. In addition, the need to meet scheduled deadlines may require it to expend more resources than otherwise budgeted for a particular network build-out. Additional authorisations may also be required if TIM expands its services into new product areas, and such authorisations may be related to auctions (e.g. in the assignment of spectrum right of use) or otherwise prove expensive or require significant cash outlays, or have certain terms and conditions, such as requirements related to coverage and pricing, with which TIM may not have previously had to comply. If TIM is unable to obtain such authorisations within the expected timeframe, at a commercially acceptable cost, or if the authorisations include onerous conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In Brazil TIM also operates under an authorisations regime. As a result, it is obliged to maintain minimum quality and service standards. Its failure to comply with the requirements imposed by Regulatory Agency for Telecommunications—Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (ANATEL) and by the Brazilian Government may result in the imposition of fines or other government actions, including the suspension of the service commercialisation for a given period. -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

TIM cannot rule out that exposure to electromagnetic fields or other emissions originating from wireless handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future. TIM’s mobile communications business may be harmed as a result of these alleged health risks. For example, the perception of these health risks could result in a lower number of customers, reduced usage per customer or potential consumer liability. In addition, although Italian law already imposes strict limits in relation to transmission equipment, these concerns may cause regulators to impose greater restrictions on the construction of radio base station towers or other infrastructure, which may hinder the completion of network build-outs and the commercial availability of new services and may require additional investments.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

The organisational model has been adopted by TIM and by its Italian subsidiaries. A specific version of the organisational model has been adopted by TIM Participações pursuant to the anti-corruption Brazilian law (Lei 12.846/13). The organisational model is continuously reviewed and must be kept up to date to reflect changes in operations and in the regulatory environment. TIM has established a 231 steering committee to prepare and consider proposals for changes to the model, for submission to the Board for approval. Notwithstanding the existence of this model or any updates that TIM may make to it, there can be no assurances that the model will function as designed, or that it will be considered adequate by any relevant legal authority. If the model is inadequate or deemed to be so, and TIM was held liable for acts committed by its senior management, executives and employees or are found otherwise non-compliant with the requirements of the legislation, TIM may be ordered to pay a fine, its authorisations, licenses or concessions may be suspended or revoked, and TIM may be prohibited from conducting business, contracting with the Italian public administration, or advertising goods and services.

TIM Brasil Business Unit also is subject to extensive regulation. Its international operations, therefore, face similar regulatory issues as it faces in Italy, including the possibility for regulators to impose obligations and conditions on how it operates its businesses in Brazil as well as taking decisions that can have an adverse effect on its results, including setting, and in particular, reducing the mobile termination rates it can charge. As a result, the decisions of regulators or the implementation of new regulations in Brazil and the costs of its compliance with any such decisions or new regulations, may limit its flexibility in responding to market conditions, competition and changes in its cost base which could individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Due to the continuous evolution of the regulatory regime affecting various parts of its business in Italy and in its international operations, TIM is unable to clearly predict the impact of any proposed or potential changes in the regulatory environment in which it operates in Italy, Brazil and its other international markets. Regulations in the telecommunications industry are constantly changing to adapt to new competition and technology. Changes in laws, regulation or government policy could adversely affect TIM’s business and competitiveness. In particular, its ability to compete effectively in its existing or new markets could be adversely affected if regulators decide to expand the restrictions and obligations to which it is subject or extend them to new services and markets. Finally, decisions by regulators regarding the granting, amendment or renewal of its authorisations, or those of third parties, could adversely affect its future operations in Italy and in other countries where TIM operates.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

This is particularly the case for Notes that are especially sensitive to interest rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been structured to meet the investment requirements of limited categories of investors.

(Clearstream, Luxembourg); and (b) if the Global Notes are not intended to be issued in NGN Form, be delivered on or prior to the original issue date of the Tranche to a common depositary (the Common Depositary) for, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Where the Global Notes issued in respect of any Tranche are in NGN form, the applicable Final Terms will also indicate whether or not such Global Notes are intended to be held in a manner which would allow Eurosystem eligibility. Any indication that the Global Notes are to be so held does not necessarily mean that the Notes of the relevant Tranche will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem either upon issue or at any times during their life as such recognition depends upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility criteria. The Common Safekeeper for NGNs will either be Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or another entity approved by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Whilst any Note is represented by a Temporary Global Note, payments of principal, interest (if any) and any other amount payable in respect of the Notes due prior to the Exchange Date (as defined below) will be made (against presentation of the Temporary Global Note if the Temporary Global Note is not intended to be issued in NGN form) only to the extent that certification (in a form to be provided) to the effect that the beneficial owners of interests in the Temporary Global Note are not U.S. persons or persons who have purchased for resale to any U.S. person, as required by U.S. Treasury regulations, has been received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as applicable, has given a like certification (based on the certifications it has received) to the Principal Paying Agent. On and after the date (the **Exchange Date) which is 40 days after a Temporary Global Note is issued, interests in such Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge) upon a request as described therein either for (i) interests in a Permanent Global Note of the same Series or (ii) for definitive Notes of the same Series with, where applicable, interest coupons and talons attached (as indicated in the applicable Final Terms), in each case against certification of beneficial ownership as described above unless such certification has already been given. The holder of a Temporary Global Note will not be entitled to collect any payment of interest, principal or other amount due on or after the Exchange Date unless, upon due certification, exchange of the Temporary Global Note for an interest in a Permanent Global Note or for definitive Notes is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal, interest (if any) or any other amounts on a Permanent Global Note will be made through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (against presentation or surrender (as the case may be) of the Permanent Global Note if the Permanent Global Note is not intended to be issued in NGN form) without any requirement for certification. The applicable Final Terms will specify that a Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge), in whole but not in part, for definitive Notes with, where applicable, interest coupons and talons attached upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event. For these purposes, Exchange Event means that (i) an Event of Default (as defined in Condition 10) has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the relevant Issuer has been notified that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently ----- to cease business or have in fact done so and no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available or (iii) the relevant Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by a duly authorised representative of the relevant Issuer is given to the Trustee. The relevant Issuer will promptly give notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14 if an Exchange Event occurs. In the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such Permanent Global Note) or the Trustee may give notice to the Principal Paying Agent requesting exchange and, in the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event as described in (iii) above, the relevant Issuer may also give notice to the Principal Paying Agent requesting exchange. Any such exchange shall occur not later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the first relevant notice by the Principal Paying Agent. The following legend will appear on all Notes (other than Temporary Global Notes) and on all interest coupons relating to such Notes where TEFRA D Rules are specified in the applicable Final Terms: “ANY UNITED STATES PERSON WHO HOLDS THIS OBLIGATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES INCOME TAX LAWS, INCLUDING THE LIMITATIONS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 165(j) AND 1287(a) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.” The sections referred to provide that United States holders, with certain exceptions, will not be entitled to deduct any loss on Notes or interest coupons and will not be entitled to capital gains treatment in respect of any gain on any sale, disposition, redemption or payment of principal in respect of Notes or interest coupons. Notes which are represented by a Global Note will only be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be. Pursuant to the Agency Agreement (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”), the Principal Paying Agent shall arrange that, where a further Tranche of Notes is issued which is intended to form a single Series with an existing Tranche of Notes on a date subsequent to the Issue Date of such further Tranche, the Notes of such further Tranche shall be assigned a common code and ISIN which are different from the common code and ISIN assigned to Notes of any other Tranche of the same Series until such time as the Tranches are consolidated and form a single Series, which shall not be prior to the expiry of the distribution compliance period (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) applicable to the Notes of such further Tranche. Any reference herein to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall, whenever the context so permits, be deemed to include a reference to any additional or alternative clearing system specified in the applicable Final Terms. No Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing. The Issuers and the Guarantor may agree with any Dealer and the Trustee that Notes may be issued in a form not contemplated by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, in which event a supplement to this EMTN Programme Prospectus or a new EMTN Programme Prospectus will be made available which will describe the effect of the agreement reached in relation to such Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

Article 9.10 of the TIM Bylaws provides that if at “any time a majority of the members of the Board of Directors should cease to hold office, for any cause or reason, the remaining Directors shall also be understood to have resigned and cease to hold office from the moment the Board of Directors is reconstituted by appointment by the shareholders’ meeting”. Acknowledging that from 24 April 2018 these conditions were met, the Board of Directors decided by a majority to call for a meeting of the Ordinary Shareholders to be held on 4 May 2018. The Board of Directors did not supplement the agenda for the Shareholders’ Meeting of 24 April 2018 and on that date the Directors in question resigned and ceased to hold office. On 27 March 2018, the Board of Statutory Auditors examined the request received from the shareholders Elliott International LP, Elliott Associates LP and The Liverpool Limited Partnership to supplement the agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 24 April 2018 and decided to supplement the agenda in accordance with the terms requested. On 4 April 2018, a supplemented agenda for the Shareholders’ Meeting called for 24 April 2018 was published with the following two additional items: - revocation of the directors (in the measure necessary, according to the timing of the resignations offered and accepted during the board meeting of 22 March 2018, pursuant to Article 2385, subsection one, of the Italian Civil Code); and - appointment of six Directors, in the persons of Fulvio Conti, Massimo Ferrari, Paola Giannotti De Ponti, Luigi Gubitosi, Dante Roscini and Rocco Sabelli, to replace Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine, Hervé Philippe, Frédéric Crépin, Giuseppe Recchi, Félicité Herzog and Anna Jones, who have ceased to hold office. The Board of Directors of TIM met on 9 April 2018 to assess the Board of Statutory Auditors’ decision to supplement the agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 24 April 2018 thereby granting the request ----- made by the shareholders Elliott International LP, Elliott Associates LP and The Liverpool Limited Partnership on 23 March 2018. The Board of Directors decided by majority vote (and with the contrary vote from Directors Borsani, Calvosa, Cornelli, Frigerio and Vivarelli) (i) to formally dissociate from the Board of Statutory Auditors’ decision, which it considered erroneous and particularly serious, (ii) to confirm that the request to supplement the Agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting of 24 April 2018 submitted by the Elliott funds was superseded, in view of the resignations of eight Directors (all of which shall come into effect before the start of the Shareholders’ meeting), (iii) to confirm the validity of the call notice for the TIM Shareholders’ meeting on 4 May 2018 in order to proceed with the full renewal of the Board of Directors, (iv) to take every legal action to protect the rights and interests of all shareholders and of the Company, to set out in full the reasons for its decisions by publishing the relevant documents (opinions and accompanying preparatory note on the discussion, along with the documentation that will be made available by the Board of Statutory Auditors) on its website, (v) to allow all TIM shareholders to have full knowledge of the Board of Directors’ positions so that they would have make informed decisions, and (iv) to send all the documents mentioned to CONSOB for consideration of those matters which are within its remit. In rejecting the arguments brought by the Board of Directors to support its deliberation, on 9 April 2018 the Board of Statutory Auditors reiterated the legitimacy of its own determinations. Furthermore, in execution of the decision taken by the Board of Directors on 9 April 2018, TIM appealed before the Milan Court of Justice the decision of the Board of Statutory Auditors to supplement the agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting of 24 April 2018 in accordance with the request of the Elliott funds. TIM requested from the Milan Court of Justice the application of urgency provisions by 24 April 2018 when the Shareholders’ Meeting was scheduled. On 24 April 2018 the Ordinary Shareholder’s Meeting of TIM was held under the chairmanship of Franco Bernabè, recording the presence of 65.94% of TIM’s ordinary share capital and (i) confirmed the appointment of Director Amos Genish, (ii) approved the 2017 financial statements, approved TIM’s remuneration policy, (iii) approved the incentive plan based on financial instruments called “Long term incentive plan 2018-2020”, (iv) did not appoint an external auditor for the period 2019-2020, and (v) appointed a new Board of Statutory Auditors to be in office until a Shareholders’ Meeting is called to approve the financial statements at 31 December 2020. On 4 May 2018 the ordinary shareholders’ meeting of TIM was held under the chairmanship of Franco Bernabè. The shareholders’ meeting recorded the presence of 67.15% of TIM’s ordinary share capital. The meeting appointed the New Board of Directors. As at the date of the meeting, Elliot International LP, Elliot Associates and The Liverpool Limited Partnership received more votes and, in accordance with by-laws, the following 10 Directors were appointed: - Fulvio Conti - Alfredo Altavilla - Massimo Ferrari - Paola Giannotti De Ponti - Luigi Gubitosi - Paola Bonomo - Maria Elena Cappello - Lucia Morselli ----- - Dante Roscini - Rocco Sabelli. The following 5 Directors were appointed by Vivendi: - Amos Genish - Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine - Marella Moretti - Michele Valensise - Giuseppina Capaldo. The newly elected Board of Directors met on 7 May 2018 and appointed Fulvio Conti as Chairman and Amos Genish as Chief Executive Officer of TIM. On 17 May 2018, TIM’s Board of Directors defined the governance structure, completing the process begun on 7 May 2018, forming a new internal committee focusing on the investigation and monitoring of interactions with related parties, and consequently the specific corporate procedure has been amended. Directors Morselli (Chairman), Capaldo, Cappello and Roscini are members of this Committee. The members of the other Committees are as follows: - Strategy Committee – Directors Conti, Genish, Gubitosi, de Puyfontaine, Ferrari, Sabelli; - Control and Risk Committee – Directors Giannotti (Chairman), Gubitosi, Ferrari, Moretti; - Nomination and Remuneration Committee – Directors Altavilla (Chairman), Bonomo, Sabelli, Valensise. The Board of Directors chose not to appoint a Lead Independent Director, being the Chairman of the Board classified as independent director. The Board of Directors has deemed that Vivendi is no longer a party exercising direction and coordination over TIM and therefore terminated the previous direction and coordination activity.

The Plan provides for the digitalisation of all processes to dramatically enhance the digital experience for best-in-class customer engagement and to create an effective digital journey. Customer experience is expected to be improved by offering one single and intuitive interface that will allow for more customised, multi-channel interaction, thanks to renewed IT architecture. The above implies a fully digital model of relationship with the client, based on the use of Big Data and advanced analytics to sustain the customer base and capture new growth opportunities, contributing to the consolidation of TIM’s leadership in the Fixed and Mobile segments. The objective over the Plan’s timespan is to significantly increase digital engagement with customers. The customer offer, based on TIM’s network leadership (fiber, 4.5G and 5G early adoption in 2020), focuses on greater convergence. The Plan, focusing on digital innovation as a key element for a leadership positioning in the Gigabit Society, is aimed at: - creating best-in-class customer engagement through a digital and agile customer journey redesign; - supporting leadership positioning by sustaining premium customer base and capturing new growth opportunities in and outside the core business; - accelerating cash flow generation to strengthen capital structure and increase shareholder return; and - implementing a new agile organisation and performance-based and data-driven culture. The main strategic priorities in the domestic (Italian) market are: Consumer: - sustain a premium customer base through convergence (data and exclusive content); - extract more value from the customer base through the acceleration of fiber migration and new avenues of growth; and - transform customer engagement through Digital journeys and new simplified portfolios. Business: - sustain traditional revenue base through convergence, fiber and VOIP migration; and - accelerate evolution towards an “ICT Company” to capture new growth opportunities (e.g., cloud, ICT on SMEs). Wholesale: - sustain traditional revenues through fiber migration; - step-change growth of non-regulated sales by radically improving customer engagement; and ----- - optimise coverage to improve competitive positioning. An important contribution to the Plan is also expected from the subsidiaries TIM Brasil, Inwit and Telecom Italia Sparkle, for which strategic priorities include: - **TIM Brasil: for the Brazilian market, the 2018 – 2020 Plan aims to confirm Tim Brasil’s leadership in Ultra-Broadband Networks and digitalise Tim Brasil customers’ experience to become the best telecommunication provider in Brazil and consistently continue to improve the financial results in terms of profitability and cash generation. In particular, a further boost is expected to be given to the 4G network with the deployment of the 700MHz coverage that, by the end of the Plan, is expected to reach more than 4,200 cities. Additionally, in order to achieve the Plan’s objectives regarding the digitalisation of the customer’s experience, Tim Brasil is planning to almost double the so-called “KPI”’s regarding digital interactions, electronic billing and electronic payment, in order to deliver a customised and flexible experience while opening opportunities for savings with respect to operating expenses. - **Inwit: strengthen leadership in the Italian tower market, leverage new mobile opportunities and lead network densification phase. - **Telecom Italia Sparkle: sustain traditional business, expand commercial footprint on new geographies and accelerate data/VAS services. The “DigiTIM” strategy combines careful financial discipline based on cost control and optimisation of investments to increase cash generation and create value. The use of data analytics is expected to allow TIM to improve investment efficiency by prioritising value-driven capital expenditure and by leveraging the current UBB infrastructure; and increase efficiencies with respect to operating expenses. The “DigiTIM” strategy is expected to drive end-to-end transformation across all business units, both structurally and culturally. To support the transformation process, company organisation at TIM will be delayered and will move from a silo-based approach to an agile one based on flexibility and speed with a focus on results. To ensure the fulfilment of the Plan, the newly created Transformation Office will oversee the execution of the programme. Moreover, on 6 March 2018, TIM’s Board of Directors granted TIM CEO Amos Genish the power to start a formal procedure to notify AGCom of TIM’s request for a voluntary separation of its fixed access network. As a result, on 27 March 2018, TIM notified AGCom, pursuant to Article 50 of the Electronic Communications Code, of the voluntarily separation of its access network through the creation of a separate legal entity (NetCo).

642,Offerings 2019.md,2070,DESCRIPTION OF TIM,2070.12,Competition in the domestic market,2070.12.1,The market,"During 2017, the Italian telecommunications market has returned to moderate growth after years of steady decline, however, the competitive pressures continue to be very significant. In addition to the core competition by other telecommunications players, which remains the primary competitive force in the market, telecommunications operators also face competition from emerging, nontraditional players, in particular Over the Top companies (OTTs) and device producers, that operate in the digital world and use a different set of assets and competitive strategies. ----- Broadband and ultrabroadband development has been confirmed as the main driver of market evolution and provides further growth opportunities for telecommunications operators with respect to the bundling of telecommunications services with Media & Entertainment, IT and digital services. As such, over time the business models of traditional players are changing to meet the challenges brought on by new entrants and to exploit new opportunities. For example: - Media & Entertainment: with the web becoming increasingly more important as a complementary distribution platform, OTTs, telecommunications operators and consumer electronics companies are playing an increasingly significant role; - Information Technology: the decline of revenues from traditional streams is driving various players towards cloud computing, with the goal of protecting the core business. Traditional telecommunications operators are strengthening in this sector, including through reliance on partnerships; - Consumer Electronics: producers can develop services that can be used through the Internet, building on handset ownership and management of user experience, breaking the relationship between customers and telecommunication operators. With respect to the current positioning of the telecommunications operators in converging markets, the following is taking place with varying levels of progress: - development of new services in the Media & Entertainment market (TV, music, gaming) and of new digital services (smart home, digital advertising, mobile payments-digital identity); - development of innovative IT services, particularly in cloud services.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180
642,Offerings 2019.md,2070,DESCRIPTION OF TIM,2070.12,Competition in the domestic market,2070.12.2,Competition in Fixed-Line Telecommunications,"The fixed-line telecommunications market continues to experience a decline in access and voice revenues, on the one hand, and a growth of broadband and ultrabroadband revenues on the other. In recent years, operators have concentrated mainly on enhancing penetration of broadband and ultrabroadband and attempting to protect voice services by introducing bundled voice, broadband and services deals in a highly competitive environment that is characterised by pricing pressures. The evolution of competitive offering strategies has also been influenced by a convergence on an approach based on the control of infrastructure, above all Local Loop Unbundling (LLU), but also fiber networks development. The main fixed operators are also offering mobile services, either with an “infrastructured” model or adopting a Mobile Virtual Operator (MVO) model. With respect to infrastructure, Open Fiber (a company under the control of Enel S.p.A.) and Infratel (a company owned by the _Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico) have disclosed and started to implement development plans for their fiber optic telecommunications networks alternatives to the TIM’s one, concerning respectively the main Italian cities and so-called “market failure” areas. Open Fiber has disclosed a 3.9 billion euro investment plan for the development of Fiber to the Home (FTTH) in 271 Italian cities by 2022, reaching approximately 9.6 million households. The service is currently available in some areas of such main cities, such as Milano, Torino and Bologna, previously reached by Metroweb Italia S.p.A. (Metroweb), as well as Bari, Cagliari, Catania, Napoli, Padova, Perugia, Venezia, Genova, Palermo and other cities. Some of TIM’s competitors in the retail communications market have signed a deal to use the Open Fiber network, wherever available, with respect to new ultrabroadband customers. ----- With respect to “market failure” areas, so-called “white areas” of C and D clusters of the plan “Banda Ultra _Larga” by the Italian Government, Infratel launched two tenders in 2016 and 2017 relating to the_ development of a network for ultrabroadband services for 9.3 million real estate units in more than 6,000 cities in 16 regions. In the first tender, Open Fiber won all five lots in the six regions involved (Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Toscana, Abruzzo and Molise), encompassing approximately 3,000 cities and 4.6 million real estate units. In the second tender, Open Fiber won all six lots in the 10 regions involved (Piemonte, Valle D’Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Provincia Autonoma di Trento, Marche, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Basilicata e Sicilia), encompassing approximately 3,700 cities and 4.7 million real estate units. Moreover, Infratel has launched on 19 April 2018 a third tender for the remaining areas in Calabria, Puglia and Sardegna. Therefore, the development of the Open Fiber plan and of the coverage deriving from Infratel tenders has brought about an important evolution with respect to competition on infrastructure, subject to the overlapping reach of available ultrabroadband infrastructures. 1. Areas with a presence of two FTTH networks overlapping with Fiber to the Cabinet (FTTC) networks. 2. Areas with a presence of only one FTTH network overlapping with FTTC networks. 3. Areas with a presence of FTTH networks overlapping with ADSL networks. 4. Areas with a presence of FTTC networks overlapping with ADSL networks. Competition in the Italian fixed telecommunications market is characterised by the presence of a number of operators in addition to TIM, such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb, Vodafone and Tiscali, that have different business models, focused on different segments of the market. In 2017, after years of contraction due to the migration of customers from fixed-line to mobile telephony services and to alternative communications solutions (Voice Over IP, messaging applications and social network chat) in Italy, there has been a slight increase of fixed accesses, which as at 31 December 2017 were estimated at approximately 20.6 million (including infrastructured OLOs and Fixed Wireless Accesses). Competition in the access market has led to a gradual reduction in TIM’s market share. As of 31 December 2017, it is estimated that the fixed broadband/ultrabroadband customers in Italy reached a penetration rate on fixed accesses of approximately 80%. The spread of broadband/ultrabroadband continues to be driven not only by the penetration of personal computers and other enabled devices (e.g. Smart TVs), but also by the growing demand for speed and access to new IP based services that are reaching a very wide diffusion (Media & Entertainment, IT, digital services).",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

In 2017, the mobile market experienced a slight growth in the spending on services, however, there were signs of weakness in the second half of the year. The contraction of revenue from traditional services, such as voice and messaging has continued, while mobile broadband has grown at a sustained rate. The growth in the mobile broadband customer base has continued due to the development of LTE, with a high penetration rate on mobile lines, especially as a result of the increasing spread of smartphones. Alongside innovative services that have already gained traction and are under full-scale development, as in the case of Mobile Apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of mobile broadband, with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as the internet of things and mobile payments. In 2017, competition in the Italian mobile telecommunications market has been characterised by the effectiveness of the merger between Wind Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. (Wind) and H3G S.p.A. (H3G) which ----- resulted in them becoming the largest player in the market in terms of SIMs. Moreover, TIM has launched Kena Mobile, a new virtual operator. The French operator Iliad has launched its mobile service in the Italian market at the end of May 2018, becoming the fourth infrastructured operator in addition to TIM, Vodafone and Wind Tre.

642,Offerings 2019.md,2071,REGULATION 1.** **THE EU REGULATORY FRAMEWORK,2071.4,,2071.4.1,,"TIM’s operations within the EU are subject to the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, which includes directives, regulations, recommendations and communications. As a Member State of the EU, Italy is required to transpose directives issued by the EU into national legislation. The regulations adopted by the European Commission (EC) are applicable and binding on each Member State without the need of further national implementation. Recommendations and communications, on the other hand, are not legally binding although they have to be taken into account by each Member State. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are independent bodies tasked with regulating and supervising the telecommunications sector and compliance with the EU framework in each Member State. In Italy, this body is “Autorità Garante per le Comunicazioni” (AGCom). The EU Regulatory Framework is based on five Directives (“Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”, “Authorisation”, “Universal Service and Users’ Rights” “Privacy and Data Protection”) that regulate all forms of fixed and wireless telecommunications and data transmission. In Italy, the Directives have been transposed into the “Codice delle comunicazioni elettroniche” (Electronic Communications Code – ECC). A Recommendation issued by the EC on “relevant product and service markets susceptible of ex ante regulation” (Commission’s Recommendation on relevant markets) completes this set of legal instruments with the definition of a list of relevant markets “whose characteristics may be such as to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations”. The Recommendation currently in effect (No. 2014/710/UE) was published on 9 October 2014, following updates in 2003 and 2007. The number of relevant markets subject to ex ante regulation has been reduced over time from 18 to 4, following the growth of the competition in the whole sector (see “Market Analyses”). In 2010, the EC adopted a Communication, the “Digital Agenda for Europe” (the DAE), setting forth longterm EU strategies for broadband. The DAE sets non-binding targets on broadband coverage and take-up to be achieved by 2020: - broadband coverage at 30 Mbit/s or more for 100% of EU citizens; and - 50% of EU households having subscriptions above 100Mbps. In September 2016, through the Gigabit Society Communication, the EC set the following (not binding) additional targets for the year 2025: - connectivity of 1 Gbps (upload and download) for all socio-economic entities (i.e. schools, businesses, public administration, etc.); - connectivity of 100 Mbps download for all European households and businesses; and - uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and major terrestrial transport routes (as an interim target, 5G should be commercially available in at least one major city in each EU Member State by 2020). On 14 September 2016, the EC issued a legislative proposal for a Directive establishing the European Electronic Communication Code (Recast) (the **EECC), which reviews and combines in one document the “Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”, “Authorisation” and “Universal Service and Users’ Rights” Directives. The EECC will have to be approved according to the standard co-decision legislative procedure by the European Parliament and the Council of EU and then transposed into national law. Institutions have already started trilogue negotiations with the aim of reaching a political agreement on the text by June 2018. The transposition of the EECC into the law of each Member State should occur by 2020. ----- A new approach to access regulation is the central feature of the proposed EECC. The key elements of the approach proposed by the EC to access regulation are: - regulatory relief in the presence of co-investment and Very High Capacity (VHC) networks; - lighter regulation for wholesale-only vertically separated undertaking with significant market power; - no price control in the presence of a demonstrable retail price constraint and effective and nondiscriminatory access; - possibility for NRAs to extend symmetric access obligations beyond the first distribution point; and - a significantly more granular geographic approach to the analysis of broadband infrastructure deployment, with the potential for differing remedies. In addition, the European Parliament has proposed to introduce an obligation to align intra-EU call prices to the domestic call prices which is still under discussion. The EC has proposed to include in the scope of the communication EECC certain categories of over-the-top (OTT), thereby addressing the level playing field issue between Telcos and OTTs, albeit only partially, as the majority of the obligations are envisaged only for “number-based” interpersonal communication services (ICS) and services based on the conveyance of signal, typically provided by Telcos. Trilogue negotiations are leading to the extension of some end-user rules to “number independent ICS”. With respect to spectrum, in order to stimulate investment, the EC has proposed a minimum duration of new spectrum licences of 25 years. EU Institutions have reached an agreement on the minimum licence duration providing for a minimum licence duration of at least 15 years with an adequate extension (on the basis of efficiency criteria set in advance of granting rights) to ensure regulatory predictability for at least 20 years. With respect to the Universal Service Obligation (USO), the EC has proposed to include in the scope of the USO the provision of affordable functional internet access and voice communications services at least at a fixed location. Member States have the flexibility to also include the availability obligation at a fixed location in the USO, if access to functional internet and voice communications services is not ensured at the national level by market or public bodies. The provision of directories, directory enquiry services and public payphones (legacy services) is removed from the EU universal service obligation, although Member States have the flexibility to retain them. The net cost of universal service would be financed with public funds, rather than by Electronic Communication Service (ECS) providers. The European Parliament and the Council of European Union would like to maintain flexibility for Member States to finance the net cost with public funds or through a sharing mechanism between operators. ",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

642,Offerings 2019.md,2073,3.** **MARKET ANALYSES,2073.1,,2073.1.1,,"The EU regulatory framework (Art. 16 of the Framework Directive) obliges National Regulatory Authorities to carry out market analyses before imposing obligations on individual operators having a Significant Market Power (SMP) according to the specific EU guidelines. According to art. 14.2 of the Directive “an undertaking is deemed to have SMP when, either individually or _jointly_ _with others, it enjoys a position equivalent to dominance, which is a position of economic strength providing the company itself with the power to behave, to an appreciable extent, independently of competitors, customers and ultimately consumers”. Market shares are normally used as a proxy for market_ power: while undertakings with market shares of no more than 25% are not likely to enjoy a (single) dominant position, single dominance concerns normally arise in the case of undertakings with market shares ----- of over 40%. Market shares in excess of 50% are in themselves, except in exceptional circumstances, evidence of the existence of a dominant position. The basis of the market analyses is the Recommendation on “relevant markets susceptible of ex ante regulation” which identifies the “relevant markets”. The first version of the Recommendation was adopted in 2003 and contained a list of 18 relevant markets. In 2007 the EC adopted the second version and reduced the number of markets to 7 (both retail and wholesale markets): retail access at a fixed location (market 1) and, at wholesale level, call origination at a fixed location (market 2); call termination at a fixed location (market 3); wholesale (physical) network infrastructure access (including shared or fully unbundled access) at a fixed location (market 4); wholesale broadband access (market 5); wholesale terminating segments of leased lines (market 6) and voice call termination on mobile networks (market 7). In October 2014, the EC adopted the third version which is currently in force and identifies only five wholesale markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation: call termination at fixed location (market 1), call termination on mobile networks (market 2), local access at fixed location (market 3a), central access at fixed location for mass-market products (market 3b), high-quality access at fixed location (market 4). The market analyses carried out by the NRAs are subject to the assessment of the EC which, to a certain extent, can challenge the NRAs’ findings, having a “veto power” on the definition of the market and on the identification of SMP operators. Vice-versa, the EC has no veto power on the imposition of the remedies but can raise serious doubts following which the BEREC is requested to give an opinion. The EC, the BEREC and the NRA must then cooperate to find a solution within three months. Neither the EC nor BEREC are able to make a binding intervention. The NRA can decide not to amend or withdraw its Decision on the remedies but it must provide a “reasoned justification”. Following a first round (2006-2007) and a second round (2007-2010) of market analyses, a third round was started by AGCom in 2012. The third round of market analysis ended in October 2016 with the AGCom Decision on fixed voice interconnection market. With respect to retail markets, despite the fact that they are not included in the current list of the EU relevant markets (Recommendation of 2014), the final AGCom Decision of the market analysis on wholesale access markets, retained some obligations, such as the notification of retail charges prior to the commercial launch and the obligation to carry a replicability test of the retail offers (taking into account the most efficient network architecture that could be used by AltNets to compete in a specific context).

Within the framework of the rules to access the fixed copper and fiber networks for the years 2015-17, AGCom also defined new measures to strengthen the equality of treatment guarantees in the provision of regulated wholesale access services at a fixed location. AGCom asked TIM to present a proposal to improve the efficiency of its own equivalence model in the provision of wholesale services to competitors and to its own commercial divisions. Consequently, in February 2016, the New Equivalence Model, in accordance with the TIM Board Decision taken on 5 November 2015, was communicated to AGCom.

Additionally, with Decision 623/15/CONS, AGCom asked TIM to present a proposal to introduce a disaggregation model for the delivery and assurance activities of the local loop and sub-loop unbundling lines. TIM’s proposal (sent to AGCom in February 2016 and submitted to public consultation by AGCom in April 2016) is based on the extension of the “System Unico” (i.e., the recourse to external companies by the competing operators) to the above-referenced delivery and assurance activities.

To date, TIM is the only operator obliged by the Code of Electronic Communications (art. 58) to provide the Universal Service under the Universal Service Obligation (USO) throughout Italy. Currently the services included in the USO are the provision of access at a fixed location and of telephone service, the directory inquiry service and the directories, the availability of public payphones, and the provision of specific measures for disabled users. A Fund (The Universal Service Fund), established by the Ministry of Communications, is used to finance the net cost for the provision of Universal Service sustained by the designated operator (TIM) by means of contributions paid by the other operators. All the main companies active in the sector, including TIM, must contribute to this fund. AGCom is responsible for verifying the net cost of the USO provision and to assess whether this amount represents an unfair burden for the operator. The designated operator can receive compensation only if the burden is determined to be unfair. AGCom assessed the net cost and authorised the funding mechanism until the year 2005 and did not recognise any contribution for the years 2006 and 2007. The net cost for the provision of USO for the years 2004-2007 have been calculated on the basis of a methodology established by AGCom in 2008 (decision 01/08/CIR) with retroactive effect, which led to a significant decrease of the amount to be financed. Following Judgment No. 4616/2015, released on 2 October 2015, with which the Council of State overruled AGCom’s Decision 1/08/CIR on the application of the new methodological criteria for the calculation of the Universal Service (USO) net cost related to the years 2004-2007, AGCom initiated proceedings for the ----- review of the calculation with Decision 145/17/CONS for the years 2006-2007 and Decision 207/17/CONS for the years 2004-2005. The proceedings remain ongoing. Furthermore, with Decision 133/17/CIR, AGCom submitted to public consultation the universal service net cost results for the years 2008-2009 with which it proposes to set the net cost value for the year 2009 to 6.7 million euros. A final decision is expected in June 2018. With respect to past litigation, the Council of State, with a decision published on 7 July 2015, rejected the appeal filed by TIM against the decision of the TAR on AGCom’s decisions of 2010 by which AGCom had reviewed the proceedings for the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003. As a result, the Council of State annulled AGCom’s Decision of 2010 establishing a possible new renewal of the proceedings for the calculation of the contributions of the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003. Following the State Council decision, Vodafone requested TIM to refund the amounts paid for 1999-2000, 2002-2003 and subsequent periods. The proceeding is still pending. With decision 456/16/CONS (October 2016), AGCom, dismissing TIM’s proposal to increase the “Voce” offer prices (April 2016), introduced a strict procedure for future variations of the retail prices regulated under the USO, providing, for example, a time period of at least one year between two subsequent tariff changes and the possibility to change the prices only with reference to: (i) increase in wholesale costs; (ii) inflation recovery; and (iii) socio-economic conditions.

The Privacy Code is divided into three parts: (1) general data protection principles; (2) additional measures applicable to organisations in certain areas, including telecommunications’ services; and (3) sanctions and remedies. The Privacy Code applies to all data processing within Italy and also affects organisations not based in Italy but using equipment located in Italy, such as computer-based systems. As of 25 May 2018, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) are fully applicable and replaced the provisions of the Italian Privacy Code, to the extent such provisions were incompatible with the GDPR. The GDPR applies to both companies established in the EU and to companies that are not established in the EU but offer their services in the EU or monitor the behaviour of individuals in the EU. According to the Code, personal data shall be processed lawfully and fairly, retained accurately and up to date and must not be excessive or stored for a longer period than needed. Therefore, information systems shall be configured in order to minimise the use of personal data. The “data subject” (any natural person that is the subject of the personal data) and the “subscriber” (any natural or legal person who or which is party to a contract with the provider of publicly available electronic communications services, or is the recipient of such services by means of pre-paid cards) shall receive preliminary information on the purposes and modalities of data processing. Prior consent of the “data subject” is needed to process personal data, except in specific cases (i.e. obligations imposed by law or by a contract with the data subject). Furthermore, the data subject has the right to access his/her personal data and to obtain information on the purposes and methods of the processing. The GDPR: - set up a one-stop shop whereby companies will only have to deal with a single national Data Protection Authority (DPA) in cross-border data protection cases; - establishes a new European Data Protection Board (EDPB) consisting of the heads of national DPAs (replacing the current Article 29 Working Party) and with the power to adopt binding decisions; and - contains fines up to a maximum of €20,000,000 or 4% of the total worldwide turnover of a company (whichever is higher). ----- The GDPR strengthens the protection of the individual’s right to personal data protection and requires significant adjustments in certain aspects, introducing (among others): - a new territorial scope, applying both to companies established in the EU and to companies that are not established in the EU but offer their services in the EU or monitor the behaviour of individuals in the EU; - the principles of data protection by design and by default to address data protection issues from the start; - each controller and, where applicable, the controller’s representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility including among the other things, the name and contact details of the controller and the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing, a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data; - stronger individual rights: the Regulation introduces new transparency requirements aimed at strengthening rights of information, access and erasure; - the new right to data portability, allowing citizens to ask a company or an organisation to receive back personal data they provided to that company on the basis of consent or contract; - stronger protection against data breaches; - the accountability principle: more flexibility for controllers and processors processing personal data due to unambiguous provisions on responsibility. For this purpose, a new tool is introduced in order to help to assess the risk before one starts with the processing: the data protection impact assessment (“PIA”) as well as increased penalties (up to 4% of the total worldwide turnover of the company) for infringements of the regulation obligations; and - the designation of a DPO.

642,Offerings 2019.md,2082,12.** **ANTITRUST ISSUES,2082.1,Legislation on competition,2082.1.1,,"TIM is subject to Italian competition law, and namely the Law of 10 October 1990 No. 287 (the “Provisions aiming at protecting competition and the market”) which set up the AGCM, or “Antitrust Authority”. The Antitrust Authority is responsible for: i applying Law No. 287 10 October 1990 and supervising: (a) restrictive agreements; (b) abuses of a dominant position; and (c) concentrations of enterprises; ii applying, whenever the necessary conditions are met, the relevant EU provisions (i.e., Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU); iii applying the Consumer Code concerning unfair commercial practices; and, iv monitoring conflicts of interest in the case of individuals holding government positions. In addition, the Antitrust Authority may: v adopt interim measures; and vi enforce commitments binding upon the proposing parties in order to dispel identified anticompetitive concerns closing the investigation without any finding of a violation. TIM is subject to the European competition law. European competition policy was developed from rules set out in the TFEU and covers anticompetitive practices and abuse of dominance, mergers and state aid: - anticompetitive practices: agreements between two or more independent market operators which restrict competition are prohibited by Article 101 of the TFEU. This provision covers both horizontal agreements (between actual or potential competitors operating at the same level of the supply chain) and vertical agreements (between firms operating at different levels, i.e. agreement between a manufacturer and its distributor). Only limited exceptions are foreseen in the general prohibition. The most obvious example of illegal conduct infringing Article 101 is the creation of a cartel between competitors (which may involve price-fixing and/or market sharing); - abuse of dominance: Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits firms holding a dominant position on a determined market to abuse that position, for example by charging unfair prices, by limiting production, or by refusing to innovate to the prejudice of consumers; - mergers: the EC is responsible for reviewing mergers if the annual turnover of the combined businesses exceeds specified thresholds in terms of global and European sales. In such cases, the EC must be notified of the transaction. Transactions falling below these thresholds may be reviewed by the national competition authorities in the EU Member States; and - state aids: public aid distorting competition and trade within the EU are prohibited (Art. 107 of the TFEU). State aid is defined as an advantage in any form whatsoever conferred on a selective basis to undertakings by national public authorities. Therefore, subsidies granted to individuals or general measures open to all enterprises do not constitute State aid. Furthermore, the EC Treaty provides that in some circumstances, government interventions are necessary for a well-functioning and equitable economy, stating some exceptions and sector specific rules. The “Guidelines for the application of State aid rules in relation to rapid development of broadband networks” establish that public funding of broadband projects is not considered state aid if one of three exemptions are used: ----- - the public authority invests under the same conditions that would be applied to a private investor (Market Economy Investor Principle—MEIP); - the public contribution is limited to the compensation of the provision of a service of general economic interest (Services of General Economic Interest principle—SGEI); - it meets certain conditions (promoting the economic development of underdeveloped areas, promoting the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, facilitating the development of certain activities or areas, promoting culture and heritage conservation). The EC is empowered by the TFEU to apply these prohibition rules and holds a number of investigative powers to that end (e.g. inspection at business and non-business premises, written requests for information, etc.). It may also impose fines on undertakings which infringe the EU antitrust rules. The main rules on procedures on the implementation of the competition rules set forth in Art. 101 and 102 of the TFEU are set out in Council Regulation (EC) 1/2003. Since 1 May 2004 all National Competition Authorities have also been empowered to fully apply EU Antitrust rules (i.e. Art. 101 and 102 of the TFEU) in order to ensure that competition is not distorted or restricted. National courts may also apply these provisions in order to protect the individual rights conferred on citizens by the Treaty. State aids rules, on the contrary, can only be applied by the EC. As part of the overall enforcement of EU competition law, the EC has also developed and implemented a policy on the application of EU competition law to actions for damages before national courts. It also cooperates with national courts in order to ensure the coherent application of the EU competition rules within the Member States.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

On 13 January 2017, the Antitrust Authority (AGCM) notified TIM of its decision, acknowledging that TIM had fully complied with resolution A428 and that the conditions for imposing sanctions for noncompliance did not apply. AGCM also acknowledged that TIM’s conduct following the 2013 resolution has been focused on improving performance in connection with the provision of wholesale access services that concerned the services subject to investigation and new ----- ultrabroadband access services. AGCM also acknowledged the positive impact of the implementation of the TIM’s New Equivalence Model (NEM), which remains ongoing. AGCM’s decision requires TIM to: i) carry on with the implementation of NEM, which is to be completed by 30 April 2017 and ii) inform the AGCM on the levels of performance of the wholesale access services provisioning systems and on the completion of the related project of internal re-organisation by May 2017. At the end of May 2017, TIM filed the information required, providing evidence of NEM implementation and data about the performance level of wholesale access services. On 9 August 2017, AGCM confirmed its positive assessment based upon the above mentioned information. - **Proceeding “A500B”: on 16 November 2016, AGCM notified TIM the opening of an investigation for alleged abusive behaviours in the market of Bulk SMS services. TIM would have hampered competition by abusing its dominant position in the market of SMS termination on its own network. The proceeding was initiated by a notification of the operator Ubiquity, active in the segment of the SMS alert services for the banking and financial sectors, in competition with TIM and other mobile operators, Vodafone included. In the complaint Ubiquity claims that TIM is applying wholesale prices that make unprofitable the provision of the retail services for the non-vertically integrated competitors such as Ubiquity. AGCM set 30 November 2017 as the deadline to close the procedure. An analogous charge has been addressed to Vodafone, against which AGCM started a separate enquiry, assuming an alleged analogous abuse of dominant position. On 12 April 2017 AGCM decided to extend the investigation to Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of TIM. On 28 July 2017, AGCM issued its preliminary findings (the so-called Statement of Objections) confirming the existence of an abuse of a dominant position by TIM. On 13 December 2017, AGCM issued its final decision, imposing a fine of approximately 3.7 million euros on TIM for having abused its dominant position in the market. On 26 February 2018, TIM appealed the decision before the TAR Lazio. Although the appeal is still pending, on 28 March 2018, TIM paid under reserve the above-mentioned fine. - **Proceeding ""I799"": on 1 February 2017, following complaints by Wind, Vodafone and Enel, AGCM opened a proceeding against TIM and Fastweb to assess potential anti-competitive agreements stemming from the creation of the joint venture Flash Fiber, aimed at deploying, in a cooperative manner, a FTTH network in 29 cities. In order to reach a conclusion of the proceedings without a finding of infringement, TIM decided to provide a proposal of commitments with some amendments to the undersigned agreement. On 9 April 2018, AGCM notified TIM and Fastweb the approval of the proposed commitments and closed the proceeding without the imposition of any fine. - **Proceeding ""A514"": on 28 June 2017, AGCM opened case A514 against TIM, aimed at assessing likely breaches of Article 102 of TFEU, based on claims raised by Infratel, Enel, Open Fiber, Vodafone and Wind Tre in May and June 2017. The investigation aimed at assessing whether TIM abused its dominant position both in the wholesale access and retail services markets with respect to the fixed broadband and ultra-broadband network. Specifically, AGCM asserts that TIM may have acted to: - slow down and hinder the execution of Infratel tenders with the aim of either delaying or making the entry to the wholesale market of another operator less profitable; and - adopt pre-emptive strategies to lock in customers in the retail ultra-broadband markets, by means of commercial policies aimed at reducing the attractiveness of end-users for competitors, thus lowering competition. On 17 January 2018, TIM submitted to AGCM a proposal of commitments it intends to make in order to close the proceedings with a finding of no infringement. On 14 February 2018, AGCM extended the scope of the investigation, assuming that TIM may have applied, in the provision of BB and UBB wholesale access services, economic conditions to hinder ----- infrastructure competition and limit competition for customers who purchase wholesale services. As a consequence, TIM is entitled to submit a new version of the undertakings by 5 July 2018. The end of the proceedings is expected by 31 October 2018. - **Proceeding ""I820"": on 7 February 2018, AGCM announced the start of an investigation of TIM, Vodafone, Fastweb, Wind-Tre and the association of operators ASSTEL to ascertain whether those companies, together with the association, coordinated their commercial strategy, thereby breaching art. 101 TFUE. The above-mentioned coordination is alleged to have resulted in the adoption of almost identical practices of implementing the obligation introduced by article 19 _quinquiesdecies of the Law by Decree 148/2017 (converted into Law 172/2017), which requires electronic communications operators to implement a billing cycle of one month (or month multiples) for fixed and mobile services. On 21 March 2018, as a precautionary measure, AGCM ordered TIM and the other operators to terminate the above-referenced alleged anticompetitive agreement relating to the repricing of their commercial offers. The precautionary measure was confirmed by AGCM on 11 April 2018 for all the operators involved. The deadline to close the proceeding is set for 31 March 2019. ",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

The remedies applied to SMP mobile operators included a glide path on mobile termination rate (VU-M), based on a price cap system. In July 2014, ANATEL published a final decision regarding the cost model and the reference values of the mobile termination rates that will apply over the period from 2016 to 2019 for SMP operators. For 2016, MTRS were set with a Top Down methodology, and 2017-2018 MTRs will be based on linear progressive reductions until convergence to the BU-LRIC model is reached in 2019. The 2019 MTR (based on a full LRIC cost model) will be 0.017 reais/min. The value for 2018 is 0.03 reais/min. Between operators with SMP a “full billing” scheme is applied (i.e. each operator charges the total amount of the traffic terminated on its network). Conversely, between SMP and non-SMP operators, an asymmetric scheme applies (so-called “partial bill& keep”): each operator only pays the portion of the terminated traffic on the other network that exceeds a threshold percentage determined by the regulator with respect of the total traffic exchanged at the interconnection. Until February 2015, this threshold was set at 80% (i.e. a non-SMP operator pays only if the terminated traffic on the SMP operator network is more than 80% of the total traffic exchanged at the interconnection). According to the previous rules, by February 2015, the “partial bill & keep” threshold between SMP and non-SMP operators would have decreased to 60% and from February 2016 the “full billing” scheme would have been adopted. To harmonise the evolution of the values of mobile interconnection with the introduction of cost-oriented values, in February 2015 the regulatory authority (ANATEL) postponed to 2019 the introduction of the “full billing” scheme in the interconnection between operators with market power and without market power, with a progressive decrease of the mentioned threshold over the next years.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

The assessment notice includes various adjustments; the main claims may be summarised as follows: - non-recognition of the fiscal effects of the merger of TIM Nordeste Telecomunicações S.A. and Maxitel S.A.; - non-recognition of the tax-deductibility of the write-down of goodwill relating to the purchase of Tele Nordeste Celular Participações S.A. (TNC); - non-recognition of certain tax offsets; - denial of the SUDENE territorial tax benefit due to alleged irregularities in the management and reporting of the benefit. The adjustments included in the assessment notice were challenged by TIM Celular, in administrative proceedings, through the presentation of its first objections on 20 April 2011. On 20 April 2012, TIM Celular received notification of the decision of the administrative court of first instance which confirmed the findings set out in the assessment notice; TIM Celular promptly filed an appeal against this decision on 21 May 2012. The company, as confirmed by the relevant legal opinions, believes it is unlikely that TIM Celular could suffer any negative consequences in relation to these matters. At the federal level, disputes involving the following are also noted: - challenges regarding offsetting against previous tax losses; - further challenges regarding the tax deductibility of the amortisation of goodwill; - imposition of income tax on certain types of exchange rate differences; ----- - imposition of withholding taxes on certain types of payments to foreign entities (for example, payments for international roaming); - further challenges regarding offsets made between taxes payable and group company credit positions.

In May 2010 TIM ceased being a defendant in the criminal trial, after the Judge for the Preliminary Hearing approved the motion for settlement of the proceedings (plea bargaining) presented by TIM. In the hearing before Section One of the Milan Court of Assizes, TIM acted in the dual role of civil party and civilly liable party. In actual fact, it was deemed liable as a civil party by all the defendants for all charges, and on the other it was also cited as the party with civil liability pursuant to Article 2049 of the Italian Civil Code for the actions of the defendants in relation to 32 civil parties. Telecom Italia Latam and Telecom Italia Audit and Compliance Services (now incorporated into TIM) also participated in the hearing as civil parties, having made appearances since the Preliminary Hearing and brought charges against the defendants for hacking. After the lengthy evidentiary hearings, 22 civil parties filed claims for compensation, including against TIM as civilly liable party, for over 60 million euros, with one party requesting over 42 million euros. TIM itself, as civil party, also summarised its conclusions against the defendants, requesting that they be found liable for all the damages suffered as a result of the facts of the case. In February 2013, Section 1 of the Milan Court of Assizes issued the first instance judgment, sentencing the defendants to terms of imprisonment of between 7 years and 6 months and one year. The Court also recognised that there had been non-pecuniary damage to some of the civil parties as a consequence of the alleged facts, and sentenced the defendants, jointly and severally with the civilly liable party TIM, to compensate said damages, totalling 270,000 euros (in part jointly and severally with Pirelli & C. S.p.A.) plus legal fees; at the same time the Court also sentenced the defendants to pay compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages incurred by TIM, granting it a provisional sum of 10 million euros. The judgment also recognised the existence of non-pecuniary damage to the companies Telecom Italia Latam and Telecom Italia Audit & Compliance Services, sentencing the defendants to pay compensation for damages on an equitable basis of 20,000 euros for each company. In November 2013 the grounds for the judgment in the first instance were published (which, for its part, TIM decided not to contest). At the end of the appeal, which was brought by the convicted defendants, the judgment in the first instance was partly reversed. The appeal judge took note of the fact that the time limit had expired on the majority of the charges and made an order not to proceed against the defendants who had been convicted in the lower court, with the exception of two, who were found guilty of the offence of revealing information which was subject to a prohibition on disclosure. As for the civil judgments, the Court revoked those made by the judge of first instance and ruled in favour of three ministries, AGCM and the Revenues Agency. The Court also decided to revoke the provisional sum of 10 million euros awarded to TIM as civil party at the end of the proceedings in the court of first instance, making a generic ruling that the defendants should pay compensatory civil damages. Finally, the judge also rejected all the demands for compensation advanced on appeal by certain civil parties for a total of about 60 million euros, in respect of which TIM has the role of party liable for damages. At the end of the appeal, therefore, the appeals court upheld the prior ruling, confirming that TIM, as the party liable for damages, had already paid the parties. The three defendants brought an appeal to the Court of Cassation against the judgment of the appeals court issued by the Milan Appeal Court of Assizes, for which the hearing occurred in April 2018. On 26 April 2018, the Court of Cassation confirmed the criminal convictions imposed by the Milan Appeal Court of Assizes and referred to the civil court every civil assessment.

The pecuniary claim was quantified by Vodafone as an estimated sum of between 876 million euros and 1,029 million euros. In particular, Vodafone alleged technical boycotting activities, with refusal to activate lines requested for Teletu customers (in the period from 2008 to the month of June 2013), together with the adoption of allegedly abusive price policies for wholesale network access services (in the period from 2008 to the month of June 2013). Furthermore, the other party complained of the presumed offering of discounts to business customers greater than those envisaged (“margin squeezing”) and the carrying out of presumed illegal and anticompetitive winback practices (in the period from the second half of 2012 to the month of June 2013). TIM filed an appearance, challenging the claims made by the other party regarding the merits and the amount and making a counterclaim. Following the August 2016 decision by the Court of Cassation which confirmed that the Milan Court had jurisdiction to decide the dispute, the merits of the case will be decided at the hearing in December 2016.

The investigation aims to establish if an agreement prohibited under Article 101 of the TFEU existed among firms. The proceedings were initiated after Wind filed two complaints in which the ICA was informed that, based on an invitation to bid for the assignment of network corrective maintenance services, it had encountered substantial uniformity of prices offered by the aforementioned enterprises and a significant difference from the offers submitted subsequently by other companies. The ICA alleged that TIM carried out the role of coordinating the other parts of the procedure, both during the formulation of the offers requested by Wind and in relation to the positions represented to communications regulator AGCom. TIM challenged these proceedings before the Administrative Court (TAR), claiming that the ICA does not have competence in this matter. ----- On 7 July 2014, the ICA announced the extension of the proceedings to confirm whether TIM, abusing its dominant position, put in place initiatives that might influence the conditions of the offer of accessory technical services when the offers of the maintenance businesses to Wind and Fastweb were being formulated. With the extension provision, the ICA has also extended the deadline for closing the proceedings from the original date of 31 July 2014 to 31 July 2015. This extension was also challenged before the Lazio Administrative Court (TAR) claiming that the Italian Competition Authority does not have competence in this matter. In November 2014, for reasons of procedural economy and also convinced that it was acting legitimately, TIM presented to the Authority a proposal of undertakings in order to resolve the competition concerns which where the subject of the investigation. In its resolution of 19 December 2014, the ICA considered that these undertakings were not manifestly groundless and later ordered their publication for the purposes of market testing. On 25 March 2015, the ICA definitively rejected the aforesaid undertakings, considering them not suitable for removing the anticompetitive aspects investigated. On 21 July 2015, the Communication of the Results of the Investigation was served on the parties to the proceedings, in which the Offices of the ICA expressed their position in the sense of (i) archiving the complaints regarding the abuse of dominant position and (ii) confirming instead that there exists between TIM and the maintenance firms an agreement to coordinate the economic offers drawn up for Wind and Fastweb, and to prevent the unbundled supply of the ancillary technical services. On 16 December 2015, the final order was issued, confirming the conclusions of the Communication of the Results of the Investigation, claiming that between 2012 and 2013 there existed an agreement that restricted competition, and as a result imposed on TIM a fine of 21.5 million euros. In March 2016, TIM payed this fine. The relevant market is the corrective maintenance (assurance) market and, more precisely, the market for troubleshooting the TIM LLU lines. The purpose of the conduct maintained by TIM and the network firms would have been to limit competition and prevent the evolution of forms of unbundled supply of ancillary technical services. TIM appealed the order before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court.

Antitrust Case A428",2084.6.14,28 days billing,"Resolution 121/17/CONS of 24 March 2017, with which AGCom supplemented its resolution 252/16/CONS, constitutes the concluding act of a regulatory process intended to safeguard price transparency and comparability of economic terms and conditions. Resolution 121/17/CONS, inter alia, introduced instructions on billing intervals for telephony, prescribing, specifically for fixed telephony, that the interval should be monthly, or multiples thereof, and, for mobile telephony, that it should be at least four-weekly. TIM appealed Resolution 121/17/CONS to the Regional Administrative Court, alleging that AGCom was exceeding its powers; the judgement rejecting the appeal was published on 12 February 2018. On 4 May 2018 the related grounds were published. TIM will challenge the decision in front of the Council of State. In December 2017, AGCom, with Resolution 499/17/CONS, found that TIM had breached the provisions of Resolution 121/17, by adopting intervals of a month, or multiples thereof, as the basis for billing its fixed telephony offers. It fined TIM 1,160,000 euros, ordering it take action—when the billing cycle was restored to monthly or multiples thereof—to reverse the charges levied for the number of days after 23 June 2017 that the users had not used the service due to the lack of alignment between the four-weekly and the monthly billing cycle. ----- TIM also appealed this second Resolution to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, asking for a preliminary suspension which, on 22 February 2018, was accepted by the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio limited to the reimbursement orders and scheduling the hearing for consideration of the merits on 14 November 2018. Law No. 172 of 4 December 2017 decreed that contracts for the supply of electronic communications services should obligatorily prescribe that the renewal of offers and the invoicing of services be based on a month, or multiples thereof. TIM complied with this order within the period of time prescribed by law, namely, within 120 days of its entry (5 April 2018). On 7 March 2018, TIM was notified of a further resolution (Resolution 112/2018/CONS) with which AGCom (i) warned TIM, with regard to fixed phone services only, to postpone the starting date of invoices issued after the return to monthly invoicing by the same number of days as those presumably deducted starting from 23 June 2017 with the four-weekly invoicing cycle; and (ii) revoked in the part resolution 499/17/CONS, in which TIM was warned to reverse the amounts presumed eroded starting from 23/6/2017 with the four-weekly invoicing cycle. The aforesaid resolution was challenged by TIM on 16 March 2018 by way of petition setting out additional grounds to be inserted within the framework of the appeal against resolution 499/17/CONS with a request for individual precautionary measures, provisionally accepted up to boardroom level on 11 April 2018, with a presidential decree published on 26 March 2017. On 9 April 2018 AGCOM issued the Presidential Decree No. 9/18/PRES with which it has de facto amended the Resolution No. 112/18/CONS, providing for specific hearings with each operator and Consumer Associations to determine the timing of the reimbursement and, therefore, TIM and the other operators involved in the presidential decree have renounced to the precautionary request. On 7 May 2018, TIM also challenged the Presidential Decree AGCOM No. 9/18/PRES and Resolution No. 187/18/CONS which ratified this decree. Lastly, on 19 February 2018 the AGCM initiated a I820 preliminary, statutory investigation against the companies TIM, Vodafone, Fastweb, Wind-Tre and the Association of category (ASSTEL) to determine whether an understanding existed aiming to limit competition between the main fixed and mobile telephony operators through the coordination of their respective commercial strategies in violation of art. 101 TFEU. The alleged coordination, according to AGCM, would have been carried out through the execution of the obligations introduced by Article 19 _quinquiesdecies of the Law by Decree No. 148 of 16 October 2017 (converted into Law No. 172 of 4 December 2017) which requires operators of electronic communication services to provide monthly (or more than once a month) invoicing and renewal of the offers for fixed and mobile services. On 21 March 2018, AGCM issued a provisional precautionary measure against all the operators involved in the proceedings with which it ordered the suspension, pending the proceedings, of the implementation of the agreement concerning the determination of repricing communicated to users at the time of reformulating the billing cycle in compliance with Law No. 172 of 4 December 2017 and to independently redetermine its commercial strategy. On 13 April 2018, the order with which the AGCM confirmed the precautionary measure was published.

Antitrust Case A428",2084.6.15,Golden Power,"In August 2017 the office of the Prime Minister initiated proceedings against TIM and Vivendi in order to verify the fact that TIM has an obligation to notify, pursuant to the Golden Power provisions, Vivendi’s acquisition of corporate control of TIM and the strategic assets it holds. In September 2017, the proceedings ----- in question concluded by ascertaining that this obligation did exist for TIM effective as of 4 May 2017 the date of the shareholders’ meeting that renewed TIM’s corporate bodies. As a result of this decision of the office of the Prime Minister, a new administrative procedure was started for the possible imposition on TIM of a pecuniary sanction pursuant to the Golden Power provisions for noncompliance with the notification obligation. Such proceeding was concluded on 8 May 2018 with the imposition of a fine of 74.3 million euros. TIM believes it will be able to demonstrate that there were no obligations to notify with respect to Vivendi’s control and it has already submitted an extraordinary appeal to the President of the Italian Republic to request the cancellation of the order of September 2017, as well as TIM is conducting all legal assessments of the potential actions it could take to protect itself following the 8 May 2018 resolution. As a result of these assessments, TIM has commenced legal action at Tar Lazio to obtain the annulment of the fine and, in the meantime, has obtained the suspension of the payment of the fine through an interim and precautionary decision taken by Tar Lazio, which has scheduled the public hearing for discussing the request of suspension for July 2018. Moreover, the office of the Prime Minister exercised the special powers laid down by the Golden Power provision through two specific rulings in October and November 2017 with which it set specific prescriptions and conditions on TIM S.p.A. and the companies of the Telecom Italia group Sparkle and Telsy Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni. The prescriptions, according to the Administrative Authority, are premised on the understanding that these companies, in part, perform activities relevant for national security and as far as TIM is concerned to the fact that it also owns the infrastructure and the systems used to provide access to end-users of services covered by the universal service obligation. Any failure on the part of the recipients of the orders to execute the conditions and prescriptions is sanctioned in the same way as failure to notify significant acts for the purpose of the application of Golden Power provisions. The companies subject to the prescriptions are required to send periodic reports to a special Monitoring Committee established at the office of the Prime Minister in order to verify compliance with the aforementioned prescriptions. In December 2017, the Group sent the office of the Prime Minister the first compliance report outlining all of the proposals and activities put in place to follow through with the prescriptions.

Essentially, the judgment confirms that the Authority has not demonstrated the particular degree of “replaceability” between fixed and mobile telephony for mobile operators to be included among the subjects required to repay the cost of the universal service, which means that AGCom needs to issue a new ruling. TIM has filed an application with AGCom to renew the proceedings, and an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the Court of Cassation (which subsequently ruled that the appeal was inadmissible). ----- In April 2016 Vodafone appealed against the Ministry of Economic Development and TIM to the Council of State, for non-compliance with the judgment of the Council of State that had already been appealed by TIM. This appeal referred to AGCom decision 109/11/CONS (2003 yearly payment, on the basis of which Vodafone had paid the sum of approximately 9 million euros as contribution, restitution of which was requested). In its judgment of November 2016, the Council of State rejected the appeal, referring to the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) the decision on the methods of compliance. In February 2017, Vodafone presented the Lazio Regional Administrative Court with four new appeals against the Ministry of Economic Development and TIM regarding observance of the ruling, upheld on appeal, countermanding the resolutions for the years 1999-2003 and repayment of the amounts of around 38 million euros already paid to the Ministry of Economic Development as a contribution.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

On December 2014 the Ivrea Public Prosecutor’s Office formulated a request for 33 of the 39 people originally investigated to be committed for trial, and at the same time asked that 6 investigations be archived. During the preliminary hearing, which started in April 2015, TIM assumed the role of civilly liable party, after being formally summonsed by all 26 civil parties (institutions and natural persons) joined in the proceedings. At the end of the preliminary hearing, 18 of the original 33 persons accused were committed for trial. The trial started in November 2015, and, as the party liable for damages, TIM has reached a settlement agreement with 12 of the 18 individuals (heirs/injured persons/family members) who are civil parties to the dispute and they have, therefore, withdrawn the claim for damages against TIM. In the judgment of first instance, in July 2016, 13 of the 18 defendants were found guilty, with sentences ranging from 1 year to 5 years of imprisonment: four of the defendants were found not guilty, and one case was dismissed for health reasons. The defendants were also sentenced to pay compensation, jointly and severally with the party liable for damages TIM, of an overall sum of approximately 1.9 million euros as a provisional payment to INAIL and 6 heirs who were not part of the settlement. A generic judgment to pay compensation for damages to the remaining damaged parties (entities/unions/associations) was issued, although they must in any case ask the civil court to quantify the damages.

Antitrust Case A428",2084.6.22,,"At the conclusion of case A428, in May 2013, Italian Competition Authority AGCM imposed two administrative sanctions of 88,182,000 euros and 15,612,000 euros on TIM for abuse of its dominant position. TIM allegedly (i) hindered or delayed activation of access services requested by OLOs through unjustified and spurious refusals; (ii) offered its access services to final customers at economic and technical conditions that allegedly could not be matched by competitors purchasing wholesale access services from TIM itself, only in those geographic areas of the country where disaggregated access services to the local network are available, and hence where other operators can compete more effectively with TIM. TIM appealed against the decision to the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio, requesting that payment of the fine be suspended. In particular, it alleged: infringement of its rights to defend itself in the proceeding, the circumstance that the organisational choices challenged by AGCM and allegedly at the base of the abuse of the OLO provisioning processes had been the subject of specific rulings made by the industry regulator (AGCom), the circumstance that the comparative examination of the internal/external provisioning processes had in fact shown better results for the OLOs than for the TIM retail department (hence the lack of any form of inequality of treatment and/or opportunistic behaviour by TIM), and (regarding the second abuse) the fact that the conduct was structurally unsuitable to reduce the margins of the OLOs. In May 2014, the judgment of the Lazio TAR was published, rejecting TIM’s appeal and confirming the fines imposed in the original order challenged. In September 2014 TIM appealed against this decision. In May 2015, with the judgment No. 2497/15, the Council of State found the decision of the court of first instance did not present the deficiencies alleged by TIM and confirmed the AGCM ruling. TIM had already proceeded to pay the fines and the accrued interest. In a decision notified in July 2015, AGCM started proceedings for non-compliance against TIM, to ascertain if TIM had respected the notice to comply requiring it to refrain from undertaking behaviours analogous to those that were the object of the breach ascertained with the concluding decision in case A428 dated May 2013. On 13 January 2017 TIM was notified of the conclusive assessment of the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM), acknowledging that TIM has fully complied with the judgment in proceedings A428 and that therefore the conditions did not exist for the imposition of any sanctions for non-compliance. AGCM also recognised that TIM’s behaviour subsequent to the 2013 proceedings had been focused on continuous improvement of its performance in the supply of wholesale access services concerning not only the services which were the subject of the investigation, but also new, super-fast broadband access services. In assessing compliance, AGCM recognised the positive impact of the ongoing implementation of TIM’s New Equivalence Model (NEM). The AGCM decision orders TIM to: (i) proceed with the implementation of the NME until its completion which is expected to be by 30 April 2017; (ii) to inform the Authority about the performance levels of the systems for providing wholesale access services and about the completion of the corresponding internal reorganisation plan by the end of May 2017. TIM quickly complied with both orders, and AGCom communicated its satisfaction on 9 August 2017. Vodafone lodged an appeal with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court against the final decision in the proceedings for non-compliance taken by AGCM.

The main claim which the proceedings are founded on is based on community jurisprudence that recognizes the right to assert the responsibility of the State in relation to violation of rights recognised in community law and injured by a judgment that has become definitive, in respect of which no other remedy may be applied. The judgment of the Council of State definitively denied the right of TIM to restitution of the concession charge for 1998 (totalling 386 million euros for Telecom Italia and 143 million euros for the former TIM Company, plus interest), already denied by the Lazio regional administrative court despite the favourable and binding opinion of the European Court of Justice in February 2008 concerning the conflict between EC Directive 97/13 on general authorisations and individual licences in the telecommunications services industry, and the national regulations that had deferred, for 1998, the obligation to pay the fee payable by telecommunications concession holders, despite the intervening deregulation process.

The contingent liabilities in question amount to approximately 500 million euros. Accordingly, a total of approximately 20 million euros in provisions for risks were allocated to cover only those cases considered likely to result in the payment of an indemnity. In relation to other sales of assets and investments, the TIM Group committed to the payment of other indemnities relating to specific contractual provisions.

TIM, as the injured party damaged by such conduct, had brought two legal actions in 2008 and 2009 and had proceeded to suspend the employees involved in the criminal proceedings (suspension later followed by dismissal). It has also filed an initial statement of defence, together with a technical report by its own expert, requesting that the proceedings against it be suspended, and that charges of aggravated fraud against TIM be brought against the other defendants. In December 2012, the Public Prosecutor’s Office filed a request for 89 defendants and TIM itself to be committed for trial. During the preliminary hearing, TIM was admitted as civil party to the trial and, in November 2013, the conclusions in the interest of the civil party were filed, reaffirming TIM’s total lack of involvement in the offences claimed. At the end of the preliminary hearing, which took place in March 2014, the Judge for the Preliminary Hearing committed for trial all the defendants (including TIM) who had not asked for their situation to be settled with alternative procedures, on the grounds that “examination in a trial” was needed. In April 2016, at the end of the first part of the trial, the Public Prosecutor asked for TIM to be sentenced to pay an administrative fine of 900 thousand euros, but decided not to ask for confiscation of any of the presumed profits of the offences (quantified in the committal proceedings as totalling several million euros), based on the assumption that TIM had in any event remedied the presumed organizational inadequacies. While acknowledging the considerable redimensioning of the accusations, TIM has reiterated its total non-involvement in the facts at issue. In November 2016 the Court gave a verdict acquitting TIM on the grounds that there was no case to answer. All the individuals charged were also acquitted on various grounds. The acquittal judgment is not final, as it was challenged in April 2017 by the Public Prosecutor who sought appeal before the Court of Cassation.

The agreements made in connection with this transaction were subsequently modified in October 2014. As a result, and in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for _Sale and Discontinued Operations), starting with the fourth quarter of 2013, the Sofora —Telecom Argentina group has_ been treated as Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale. On 8 March 2016, the TIM Group completed the sale of Sofora —Telecom Argentina group. (1) For the purposes of IFRS, “Parent”, as used in this EMTN Programme Prospectus and in the 2017 TIM Annual Report, means TIM S.p.A. (2) In accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings per share), basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Group’s profit (loss) available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares. Since TIM has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of 0.55 euros per share above dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of: - Ordinary Shares was 15,039,368,195 for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 15,039,128,128 for the year ended 31 December 2016; - Savings Shares was 6,027,791,699 for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and convertible securities. The Group’s profit (loss) is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares net of the related tax effects. (3) TIM’s dividend coupons for its Savings Shares for the year ended 31 December 2017, will be clipped on 18 June 2018 and will be payable from 20 June 2018. (4) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the accounting par value of treasury shares; accounting par value is the ratio of total share capital and the number of issued shares. (5) In order to present a more realistic analysis of net financial debt, in addition to the usual indicator (renamed “Net Financial Debt carrying amount”), “Adjusted Net Financial Debt” is also shown; such indicator excludes effects that are purely accounting and non-monetary in nature deriving from the fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial assets and liabilities. Net Financial Debt is one of the alternative performance measures presented in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS for purposes of a better understanding of the trend of operations and the financial condition of the TIM Group. Specifically, TIM believes that Net Financial Debt provides an accurate indicator of its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and other Financial Assets. Net Financial Debt is also used in presentations to investors and analysts. Adjusted Net Financial Debt as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is calculated as follows: ----- Mobile lines [(6)] ........................................................................................ 57,894 58,634 Notes: (*) In order to allow comparison of the economic and financial results for the first quarter of 2018 with those for the same periods of the previous year, the economic data prepared in accordance with the previous accounting standards (IAS 39, IAS 18, IAS 11 and related Interpretations) are also presented.

In case of payments to nonItalian resident Noteholders, a final withholding tax may be applied at 26 per cent.. Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may apply allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate of withholding tax. In accordance with another interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident guarantor will be treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the relevant Issuer and will thus be subject to the tax regime described in the previous paragraphs of this section.",N/A,as_expected,2019,180

For this purpose, debentures similar to bonds are securities that incorporate an unconditional obligation to pay, at maturity, an amount not lower than their nominal value. In the case of Notes issued by TIM, where the Noteholder is (i) an Italian individual engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, (ii) an Italian company or a similar Italian commercial entity, (iii) a permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign entity to which the Notes are effectively connected, (iv) an Italian commercial partnership or (v) an Italian commercial private or public institution, such withholding tax is a provisional withholding tax.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is (i) an individual holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity, (ii) a non-commercial partnership, (iii) a non-commercial private or public institution, any capital gain realised by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be subject to imposta sostitutiva, levied at the rate of 26 per cent.. Noteholders may set off losses with gains. Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains realised upon sale or redemption of the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26 per cent. imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10 February 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017. In respect of the application of imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt for one of the three regimes described below. a) “Regime della dichiarazione”. Under the tax declaration regime (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above, imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains, net of any incurred capital loss, realised by the Italian resident individual Noteholder holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity pursuant to all sales or redemptions of the Notes carried out during any given tax year. The relevant Noteholder must indicate the overall capital gains realised in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in the annual tax return and pay _imposta sostitutiva_ on such gains together with any balance income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realised in any of the four succeeding tax years. Pursuant to Law Decree No. 66 of 24 April 2014, converted with amendments into Law No. 89 of 23 June 2014 (Decree No. 66), capital losses realised from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2014 may be carried forward to be offset against capital gains of the same nature realised after 30 June 2014 for an overall amount of 76.92 per cent. of the capital losses. b) “Regime del risparmio amministrato”. As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian resident individual Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above may elect to pay the _imposta sostitutiva separately on capital gains realised on each sale or redemption of the Notes (the _risparmio _amministrato regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to (i) the Notes_ being deposited with Italian banks, SIMs or certain authorised financial intermediaries (including permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) and (ii) an express election for the _risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant Noteholder. The_ depository is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realised on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realised upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the taxpayer, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the _risparmio amministrato regime, where a sale or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, such loss may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realised, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains ----- in the annual tax return. Pursuant to Decree No. 66, capital losses realised from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2014 may be carried forward to be offset against capital gains of the same nature realised after 30 June 2014 for an overall amount of 76.92 per cent. of the capital losses. c) “Regime del risparmio gestito”. Any capital gains realised by Italian Noteholder under (i) to (iii) above who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorised intermediary and have opted for the so-called risparmio gestito regime will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realised, at year end, subject to a 26 per cent. substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorised intermediary. Under the _risparmio gestito regime, any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at year end may be carried forward against increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. Under the risparmio gestito regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains realised in the annual tax return. Pursuant to Decree No. 66, decreases in value of the managed assets registered from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2014 may be carried forward to be offset against any subsequent increase in value accrued as of 1 July 2014 for an overall amount of 76.92 per cent. of the decreases in value. Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder that is an Italian real estate investment fund or any Italian real estate SICAF to which the provisions of Decree No. 351 or Decree No. 44 as subsequently amended apply will be subject neither to _imposta sostitutiva_ nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding tax or a substitute tax at the rate of 26 per cent. will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realised by unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Any capital gains realised by an Italian Noteholder that is a Fund, a SICAF or a SICAV will not be subject to _imposta sostitutiva, but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the_ relevant tax period. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but income realised by unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares, may be subject to a withholding tax of 26 per cent.. Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to the 20 per cent. substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20 per cent. substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ Capital gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of Notes traded on regulated markets are not subject to imposta sostitutiva. Capital gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of the Notes not traded on regulated markets are not subject to imposta sostitutiva provided that the beneficial owner (i) is resident for income tax purposes in a country included in the White List; or (ii) is an international entity or body set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (iii) is a Central Bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State; or (iv) is an institutional investor which is incorporated in a country included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own country of residence.
