**EMTN PROGRAMME PROSPECTUS**

**_This document constitutes two base prospectuses: (i) the base prospectus of TIM S.p.A. and (ii) the base prospectus of Telecom Italia Finance_**
**_S.A. (together, the EMTN Programme Prospectus)._**

**TIM S.p.A.**
(incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Republic of Italy)

**TELECOM ITALIA FINANCE S.A.**
(incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg)

**€20,000,000,000**
**Euro Medium Term Note Programme**
**unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed in respect of Notes issued by**

**Telecom Italia Finance S.A. by**

**TIM S.p.A.**
(incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Republic of Italy)
Under this €20,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the **Programme), TIM S.p.A. (TIM) and Telecom Italia Finance S.A. (TI**
**Finance and, together with TIM in its capacity as an issuer, the** **Issuers and each an** **Issuer) may from time to time issue notes (the** **Notes)**
denominated in any currency agreed with the relevant Dealer (as defined below).

Payment of all amounts owing in respect of the Notes issued by TI Finance will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by TIM (in such
capacity, the Guarantor).

The maximum aggregate nominal amount of all Notes from time to time outstanding under the Programme will not exceed €20,000,000,000 (or its
equivalent in other currencies calculated as described in the Programme Agreement), subject to increase as described herein.

The Notes may be issued on a continuing basis to one or more of the Dealers specified under “Overview of the Programme” and any additional
Dealer appointed under the Programme from time to time by the Issuers (each a Dealer and, together, the Dealers), which appointment may be for a
specific issue or on an ongoing basis. References in this EMTN Programme Prospectus to the relevant Dealer shall, in the case of an issue of Notes
being (or intended to be) subscribed by more than one Dealer, be to the Lead Manager(s) acting on behalf of all Dealers agreeing to subscribe such
Notes.

**An investment in Notes issued under the Programme involves certain risks. For a discussion of these risks see "Risk Factors".**

Application has been made to the _Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the_ **CSSF) in its capacity as competent authority under the**
Luxembourg law of 10 July 2005 on prospectuses for securities, as amended (the **Prospectus Act 2005) to approve this document as two base**
prospectuses, the base prospectus of TIM and the base prospectus of TI Finance. The CSSF assumes no responsibility for the economic and financial
soundness of the transactions contemplated by this EMTN Programme Prospectus or the quality or solvency of either Issuer in accordance with
Article 7(7) of the Prospectus Act 2005. Application has also been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for Notes issued under the Programme
to be admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s regulated market and to be listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange.

References in the two base prospectuses to Notes being listed (and all related references) shall mean that such Notes have been admitted to trading on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s regulated market and have been admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The
Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s regulated market is a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive
2014/65/EU).

Notice of the aggregate nominal amount of Notes, interest (if any) payable in respect of Notes, the issue price of Notes and certain other information
which is applicable to each Tranche (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”) of Notes will be set out in a Final Terms document (the
**Final Terms) which will be filed with the CSSF. Copies of Final Terms in relation to Notes to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange will**
also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

The Programme provides that Notes may be listed or admitted to trading, as the case may be, on such other or further stock exchange(s) or markets as
may be agreed between the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) and the relevant Dealer. The Issuers may also
issue unlisted Notes.

Subject to and as set out in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes — Taxation”, TIM shall not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the
Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of 1 April 1996 (as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time) where the Notes are held by a Noteholder resident for tax purposes in a country which does not allow
for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy and otherwise in the circumstances described in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes —
_Taxation”._

TI Finance has a right of substitution as set out in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes — Meeting of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver,
_Authorisation, Determination and Substitution”. The Trustee may at any time agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders (all as_
defined in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”), to the substitution, in place of TI Finance, of TIM or any Subsidiary (as defined in “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes”) of TIM as principal debtor under the Notes and the Coupons (all as defined in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”). TIM_
shall indemnify each Noteholder and Couponholder against (A) any tax, assessment or governmental charge which is imposed on such Noteholder or
Couponholder by (or by any authority in or of) the Republic of Italy (Italy) with respect to any Note or Coupon and which would not have been so
imposed had the substitution not been made and (B) any tax, assessment or governmental charge, and any cost or expense relating to the substitution,
except that TIM shall not be liable under such indemnity to pay any additional amounts either on account of “imposta sostitutiva” or on account of
any other withholding or deduction in the event of payment of interest or other amounts paid to a non-Italian resident legal entity or a non-Italian
resident individual which is resident in a country which does not allow for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy. As long as the Notes are
admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s regulated market and/or listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in
the case of such substitution, TIM will advise the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, a new EMTN Programme base prospectus will be prepared and the
Noteholders will be notified in accordance with the provisions of “Terms and Conditions of the Notes - Notices”.


-----

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the **Securities Act) or any U.S. State**
securities laws, but the Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. The Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the
account or the benefit of, U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act unless an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act is available and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States and any other jurisdiction.

Tranches of Notes to be issued under the Programme will be rated or unrated. Whether or not a rating in relation to any Tranche of Notes will be
treated as having been issued by a credit rating agency established in the European Union (the EU) and registered under Regulation (EC) 1060/2009
on credit rating agencies (as amended) (the **CRA Regulation) will be disclosed in the relevant Final Terms. A security rating is not a**
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
Please also refer to “Credit ratings may not reflect all risks” in the “Risk Factors” section of this EMTN Programme Prospectus.

Interest amounts payable under the Floating Rate Notes will be calculated by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as specified in the relevant Final
Terms. As at the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus, the ICE Benchmark Administration (as administrator of LIBOR) is included in register
of administrators maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) under Article 36 of the Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 (the
**Benchmarks Regulation). As at the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus, the European Money Markets Institute (as administrator of**
EURIBOR) is not included in the ESMA’s register of administrators under Article 36 of the Benchmarks Regulation. As far as the Issuer is aware, the
transitional provisions in Article 51 of the Benchmarks Regulation apply, such that European Money Markets Institute (as administrator of
EURIBOR) is not currently required to obtain authorisation or registration (or, if located outside the European Union, recognition, endorsement or
equivalence).

**EMTN Programme Prospectus and none of them makes any representation or warranty or accepts**
**any responsibility as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this EMTN**
**Programme Prospectus or any responsibility for any acts or omissions of the Issuer or the Guarantor**

**No person is or has been authorised by any of the Issuers, the Guarantor or the Trustee to give any**
**information or to make any representation not contained in or consistent with this EMTN Programme**
**Prospectus or any other information supplied in connection with the Programme or the Notes and, if**
**given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised**

**should be considered as a recommendation by any of the Issuers, the Guarantor, any of the Dealers or**

**supplied in connection with the Programme or any Notes should purchase any Notes. Each investor**
**contemplating purchasing any Notes should make its own independent investigation of the financial**

**Guarantor (if applicable). Neither this EMTN Programme Prospectus nor any other information**
**supplied in connection with the Programme or the issue of any Notes constitutes an offer or invitation**
**by or on behalf of any of the Issuers, the Guarantor, any of the Dealers or the Trustee to any person to**
**subscribe or purchase any Notes.**

-----

**date indicated in the document containing the same. The Dealers and the Trustee expressly do not**
**undertake to review the financial condition or affairs of any of the Issuers or the Guarantor during the**
**life of the Programme or to advise any investor in Notes issued under the Programme of any**
**information coming to their attention. Investors should review, inter alia, the most recently published**
**documents incorporated by reference into this EMTN Programme Prospectus when deciding whether**
**or not to purchase any Notes.**

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be**
**offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made**
**available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (EEA). For these purposes, a retail**
**investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article**
**4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of**
**Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the Insurance Mediation Directive), where that customer would**
**not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no**
**key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the PRIIPs**
**Regulation) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in**
**the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them**
**available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.**

**MiFID II product governance / target market – The Final Terms in respect of any Notes will include a**
**legend entitled "MiFID II product governance" which will outline the target market assessment in**
**respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person**
**subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a distributor) should take into**
**consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible**
**for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or**
**refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.**

**A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the Product**
**Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the MiFID Product Governance Rules),**
**any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes, but otherwise neither**
**the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the**
**purpose of the MIFID Product Governance Rules.**

**RISK FACTORS**

In purchasing Notes, investors assume the risk that the Issuers and the Guarantor may become insolvent or
otherwise unable to make all payments due in respect of the Notes or under the Guarantee. There is a wide
range of factors which individually or together could result in the Issuers or the Guarantor becoming unable
to make all payments due. It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which factors are most
likely to occur, as the Issuers and the Guarantor may not be aware of all relevant factors and certain factors
which they currently deem not to be material may become material as a result of the occurrence of events
outside of the Issuers’ and the Guarantor’s control. The Issuers and the Guarantor have identified in this
EMTN Programme Prospectus, including in the information incorporated by reference herein (see
“Documents Incorporated by Reference” below), a number of factors which could materially adversely affect
their businesses and ability to make payments due.

In addition, factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with Notes
issued under the Programme are also described below.

**Factors that may affect the Issuers’ ability to fulfil their obligations under Notes issued under the**
**Programme — Factors that may affect the Guarantor’s ability to fulfil its obligations under the**
**Guarantee** **_(for the purposes of these risk factors “TIM” means TIM S.p.A. and/or its consolidated_**
**_subsidiaries as they exist as at the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus)._**

The Issuers outline below:

- TIM’s main objectives as set out in its 2018-2020 Strategic Plan (the 2018-2020 Plan or the Plan);
and

- factors that may prevent TIM from achieving its objectives. For purposes of presenting its risk
factors TIM has identified its risks based on the main risk categories, set out in the Committee of
Sponsoring Organisation of the Treadway Commission[1]:

 strategic risks;

 operational risks;

 financial risks; and

 compliance risks.

**TIM’s business will be adversely affected if TIM is unable to successfully implement its strategic**
**objectives. Factors beyond its control may prevent it from successfully implementing its strategy.**

On 6 March 2018 TIM’s Board of Directors approved the Plan. The Plan provides for the digitalisation of all
processes to dramatically enhance the digital experience for best-in-class customer engagement and to create
an effective digital journey. Customer experience is expected to be improved by offering one single and
intuitive interface that will allow for more customised, multi-channel interaction, thanks to renewed IT
architecture. The above implies a fully digital model of relationship with the client, based on the use of the
so-called “big data” and advanced analytics to sustain the customer base and capture new growth
opportunities, contributing to the consolidation of TIM’s leadership in the fixed and mobile segments.

TIM’s ability to implement and achieve its strategic objectives and priorities may be influenced by certain
factors, including factors outside of its control. Such factors include:

1 CoSO Report-ERM Integrated Framework 2004.


-----

- a deterioration of the economic environment in the principal markets in which TIM operates,
including, in particular, its core Italian market;

- the impact of regulatory decisions and changes in the regulatory environment in Italy, Brazil and
other countries in which TIM operates;

- the impact of political developments in Italy, Brazil and other countries in which TIM operates;

- TIM’s ability to successfully compete on both price and innovation capabilities with respect to new
products and services;

- TIM’s ability to develop and introduce new technologies that are attractive in its principal markets,
to manage innovation, to supply value added services and to increase the use of its fixed and mobile
networks;

- TIM’s ability to successfully implement its internet and broadband/ultrabroadband strategy;

- TIM’s ability to successfully achieve its financial targets (including debt reduction);

- the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates and the performance of the equity
markets in general;

- the outcome of litigation, disputes and investigations in which TIM is involved or may become
involved;

- TIM’s ability to build up its business in adjacent markets and in international markets (particularly in
Brazil), due to its specialist and technical resources;

- TIM’s ability to achieve the expected return on the investments and capital expenditures it has made
and continues to make in Italy, Brazil and other countries in which it operates;

- the amount and timing of any future impairment charges for TIM’s authorisations, goodwill or other
assets;

- TIM’s ability to manage any business or operating model transformation plans;

- disruptions or uncertainties resulting from the United Kingdom’s expected exit from the EU;

- any difficulties which TIM may encounter in its supply and procurement processes, including as a
result of the insolvency or financial weaknesses of its suppliers; and

- the costs TIM incurs due to unexpected events, in particular where its insurance is not sufficient to
cover such costs.

_As a result of these uncertainties there can be no assurance that the business and strategic objectives_
_identified by TIM’s management can effectively be attained in the manner and within the time-frames_
_described. Furthermore, if TIM is unable to attain its strategic priorities, its goodwill may be further_
_impaired, which could result in further significant write-offs._

The following sets out more specific factors that may prevent TIM from achieving its objectives.

**STRATEGIC RISKS**

**_Weak global economic conditions, including the continuing weakness of the Italian economy and political_**
**_conditions in Brazil, have adversely affected its business in recent years. Economic recovery in the_**
**_Eurozone has been uneven. Economic conditions in the Italian economy have shown improvement,_**


-----

**_however, uncertainty persists with respect to the economic outlook, which could have a negative impact on_**
**_TIM’s operating results and financial condition._**

TIM’s business is dependent on general economic conditions in Italy and in its other principal market,
Brazil, including with respect to interest rate levels, inflation, taxation and general business conditions. The
weak economic conditions of the last several years have had an adverse impact on its business and results of
operation.

The prolonged economic recession that Italy has experienced in recent years has negatively impacted
development prospects in its core Italian market. The Italian economic recession has ended and the economic
growth is at 1.5% for 2017 and 1.4% for 2018. Gross fixed investment, household consumption, exports and
employment have shown improvement. However, Italian gross domestic product (GDP) growth continues to
lag behind the Eurozone average. Uncertainty related to the outcome of the political elections and the
announced reductions in the ECB bond-buying programme may raise costs for government borrowing, while
the so-called “fiscal compact” obligations to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio will likely prevent any
expansionary fiscal policy measures in the years to come.

In Brazil economic growth has resumed, after declining for eight consecutive quarters. Initially driven
primarily by improvements in the agriculture sector, Brazil’s recovery now appears to be positively impacted
by growth across various sectors. GDP grew by 1% in 2017. It is also important to highlight that the market
projections show an acceleration of such growth for 2018 (2.8%), according to the Central Bank Focus
Report. The inflation, measured by the IPCA, was under strict control at 2.9%, by the end of 2017, below the
minimum target set by the Central Bank, a significant reduction when compared to 2016, when the IPCA
reached 6.3%. This has resulted in rising real incomes and lower interest rates, which are expected to further
support the recovery. Unemployment has decreased; however, consumer and business confidence still
remain sensitive to political developments. In 2018, Brazil will face one of its most unpredictable
presidential elections in the past years, in the middle of severe turbulence caused by corruption scandals and
the unfolding of “Lava Jato”.

Despite the positive trend, continuing uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumer
and business customers postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news (including
high levels of unemployment) or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative
effect on the demand for TIM’s products and services. Economic difficulties in the credit markets and other
economic conditions may reduce the demand for or the timing of purchases of TIM’s products and services.
A loss of customers or a reduction in purchases by TIM’s current customers could have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash-flow and may negatively affect its ability to
meet its targets. Other factors that could influence customer demand include access to credit, consumer
confidence and other macroeconomic factors.

**_Vivendi is TIM’s largest shareholder and exercises significant influence over TIM._**

As of the date hereof, the largest single shareholder in TIM is Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), which holds directly,
a stake of approximately 23.94% of ordinary share capital. With a holding of this size, Vivendi can exercise
significant influence over matters subject to a vote of the ordinary shareholders of TIM, such as nominations
to the Board of Directors (the **Board), matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the**
acquisition or disposition of assets, issuances of equity and the incurrence of indebtedness.

**_Competition Risks_**

**_Alternative infrastructure operators in Italy could pose a threat to TIM, particularly in the medium to_**
**_long term._**

In the fixed market, alternative network operators (AltNet), such as Open Fiber S.p.A. (Open Fiber) and
Infratel Italia S.p.A. (Infratel), have disclosed and started to implement plans to develop alternative
ultrabroadband telecommunications networks in the main Italian cities in Italy and in so-called market failure
areas. Similar alternative developments, either on a standalone basis or through partnerships with other


-----

licensed operators (OLOs), could adversely impact TIM’s businesses, assets and goodwill and, as a
consequence, its economic and financial performance. In particular, TIM faces risks with respect to
increasing competition in the National Wholesale Market, which could result in losses with respect to its
customer base and revenues and a potential loss of retail market share and revenues.

**_Strong competition in Italy or other countries where TIM operates may further reduce its core market_**
**_share for telecommunications services and may cause reductions in prices and margins thereby having a_**
**_material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition._**

Telecommunications operators have generally faced challenging market conditions in recent years,
principally as a result of the decline in voice traffic and significant pricing pressures resulting from increased
competition among operators.

Strong competition exists in all principal areas of the Italian telecommunications business in which TIM
operates.

Competition may become even more acute in the coming years, with additional international operators
accessing the Italian market.

The Italian telecommunications market is experiencing a phase of transformation with respect to
competition. Since 31 December 2016, Wind Tre S.p.A. (Wind Tre) has become operative. Wind Tre
resulted from the merger of Wind and H3G, which was authorised by regulatory bodies subject to certain
structural corrective measures, including the sale of frequencies and signature of a roaming contract, and
which cleared the way for French operator Iliad S.A. (Iliad) to enter the Italian market as the fourth mobile
infrastructured player alongside TIM, Vodafone Italia S.p.A. (Vodafone) and Wind Tre. Iliad has launched
its mobile service in the Italian market at the end of May 2018.

Moreover, convergence has enabled lateral competition from Information Technology (or IT), over-the-top
(OTT), media and devices/consumer electronic players. This competition may further increase due to
globalisation and the consolidation of the telecommunications industry in Europe, including Italy, and
elsewhere.

The emergence of alternative infrastructure operators could also pose a threat to TIM, particularly in the
medium to long term.

Competition in TIM’s principal lines of business has led, and could lead, to:

- price and margin erosion for its traditional products and services;

- loss of market share in its core markets;

- loss of existing or prospective customers; and

- greater difficulty in retaining existing customers.

In addition, competition with respect to innovative products and services in TIM’s Italian domestic fixedline, mobile telephony and broadband/ultrabroadband businesses, has led, and could lead to:

- obsolescence of existing technologies and more rapid deployment of new technologies;

- an increase in costs and payback period related to investments in new technologies that are necessary
to retain customers and market share; and

- difficulties in reducing debt and funding strategic and technological investments if TIM cannot
generate sufficient profits and cash flows.


-----

Although TIM continues to take steps to realise additional efficiencies and to rebalance its revenue mix
through the continuous introduction of innovative and value-added services, if any or all of the events
described above occur, the impact of such factors could have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Continuing rapid changes in technologies could increase competition, reduce usage of traditional services_**
**_and require TIM to make substantial additional investments._**

TIM, like other operators, faces increasing competition from non-traditional data services on new voice and
messaging over-the-internet technologies, in particular OTT applications such as Skype, FaceTime,
Messenger and WhatsApp. These applications are often free of charge, other than charges for data usage and
are accessible via smartphones, tablets and computers. These applications provide users with potentially
unlimited access to messaging and voice services over the internet, bypassing more expensive traditional
voice and messaging services, such as SMS, which have historically been a source of significant revenues for
fixed and mobile network operators like TIM. In Italy and Brazil, an increasing number of customers are
using OTT applications services instead of traditional voice and SMS communications.

Historically, TIM has generated a substantial portion of its revenues from voice and SMS services,
particularly in its mobile business in Italy, and the substitution of data services for these traditional voice and
SMS volumes has had and could continue to have a negative impact on TIM’s revenues and profitability.

If non-traditional voice and messaging data services continue to increase in popularity, as they are expected
to, and TIM is unable to address such competition, its average revenue per user (ARPU) could decline and
TIM would face lower margins across many of its products and services, resulting in a material adverse
effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_TIM may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully implement its Internet and broadband/fiber/_**
**_4.5G/5G NGNM strategy._**

The continuing development of Internet and broadband/fiber services constitutes a strategic objective for
TIM that aims to increase the use of its networks in Italy and abroad to offset the continuing decline of
traditional voice services. Its ability to successfully implement this strategy may be negatively affected if:

- broadband/fiber mobile coverage does not grow as TIM expects;

- competition grows to include players from adjacent markets or technological developments
introducing new platforms for Internet access and/or Internet distribution;

- it is unable to provide superior broadband/fiber connections and broadband/mobile services relative
to its competitors;

- it experiences network interruptions or related capacity problems with network infrastructure; and

- it is unable to obtain adequate returns from the investments related to its network development.

However, implementation of 4.5G/5G ultrabroadband mobile technologies is dependent on a number of
factors, including the following:

- _Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico (MISE) public competition for the assignment of additional_
spectrum frequency;

- availability and selection of cutting-edge technology from TIM’s network/platforms and device
vendors.

If TIM fails to achieve its objectives for the implementation of ultrabroadband mobile coverage in a timely
manner, or at all, it may lose market share to its competitors in this strategically important segment.


-----

Any of the above factors may adversely affect the successful implementation of its strategy, its business and
results of operations.

**_TIM’s business may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully implement its Information and_**
**_Communications Technology (ICT) strategy._**

TIM intends to continue focusing on Information Technology-Telecommunication (IT-TLC) convergence
by addressing the ICT market, offering network and infrastructure management, as well as application
management. In particular, as the market for cloud services continues to grow, the ICT market is expected to
become a key element of its strategy.

TIM expects increasing competition in this market as additional competitors (mainly from
telecommunications operators, through the acquisition of partnerships with IT operators) also enter this
market. If TIM fails to grow its market share or compete effectively, its revenues could be negatively
affected.

**_TIM’s business may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully implement its “next-generation_**
**_networks” strategy._**

One of its goals is to accelerate the roll-out of a new telecommunications network capable of providing
customers with ultrabroadband connections, generally referred to as a next-generation network (NGN).

However, implementation of ultrabroadband technologies is dependent on a number of factors including:

- delays in receiving the necessary permissions and authorisations for installation of NGN lines;

- resistance by road administrators to the use of innovative techniques for excavation and the laying
fiber optic cables;

- delay in the operation of SINFI (Sistema Informativo Nazionale Federato delle Infrastrutture).

In areas not provided for under TIM’s development plan or where implementation of the ultrabroadband plan
is conditioned upon the grant of public funds, in addition to those listed above, the following factors should
be considered:

- allocation of public funds at the local level;

- fulfilment of technical and economic conditions related to the EuroSUD (a European funding
telematic counter) tenders awarded to TIM; and

- the awarding of tenders for the grant of public funds, which unduly penalise TIM by setting
wholesale prices considerably lower than the regulated prices applicable to TIM’s similar services
which are set in its Reference Offer as approved by AGCom.

If TIM fails to achieve its objectives for the implementation of ultrabroadband coverage in a timely manner,
or at all, TIM may lose market share to its competitors in this strategically important segment, which may
adversely impact TIM’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_TIM is subject to risks associated with political developments in countries where it operates._**

Changes in political conditions in Italy (considering also the results of the 4 March 2018 election) and in
other countries where TIM has made significant investments (particularly in countries where the political
situation is less predictable than in Western Europe) may have an adverse effect upon its business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.


-----

**_The Italian State is in a position to exert certain powers with respect to TIM._**

In 2012, regulations relating to the special powers regarding strategic assets in the energy, transport and
communications sectors were published and became effective (Law Decree No. 21 of 15 March 2012,
adopted with modifications by Law No. 56 of 11 May 2012).

Following enactment of such regulation, art. 3 of Presidential Decree No. 85 of 25 March 2014 identified the
following as strategic assets in the communications sector:

1. dedicated networks and access to a public network for final customers in connection with

metropolitan networks, service routers and long-distance networks;

2. assets used for the provision of access for final customers to services that fall within the obligations

of universal service and broadband and ultrabroadband services;

3. dedicated elements, even if not in exclusive use, for connectivity (phone, data, video), security,

control and management concerning fixed telecommunication access networks.

Presidential Decree No. 86 of 25 March 2014 sets out the procedures for handling of special powers in the
communications sector.

As a result, the rules presently in force provide for:

- the power of the Italian Government to impose conditions and possibly oppose the purchase, under
certain conditions, by non-EU entities, of controlling stakes in companies that hold the
aforementioned types of assets. Until the end of the 15-day period from the notice of the purchase,
within which conditions may be imposed, or the power to oppose the initiative exercised, voting
rights (and any rights other than the property rights) connected to shares whose sale entails the
transfer of control, may be suspended. The same rights may be suspended in the case of any noncompliance with or breach of the conditions imposed on the purchaser, for the whole of the period in
which the non-compliance or breach persists. Any resolutions adopted with the determining vote of
said shares or holdings, as well as the resolutions or acts adopted that breach or do not comply with
the conditions imposed, will be null and void;

- veto power by the Italian Government (including through the imposition of prescriptions or
conditions) over any resolution, act or transaction that has the effect of modifying the ownership,
control or availability of such strategic assets or changing their destination, including resolutions of
merger, demerger, transfer of registered office abroad, transfer of the company or business units
which contain the strategic assets, or their assignment by way of guarantee. Resolutions or acts
adopted breaching such prescriptions are null and void. The Government may also order the
company and any other party to restore the antecedent situation at their own expense.

The exercise of such powers, or the right or ability to exercise such powers, could make a change of control
transaction with respect to TIM (whether by merger or otherwise) more difficult to achieve, if at all, or
discourage certain bidders from making an offer relating to a change of control that could otherwise be
beneficial to shareholders.

**OPERATIONAL RISKS**

TIM faces numerous risks with respect to the efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation. Operational
risks related to its business, include those resulting from inadequate internal and external processes, fraud,
employee errors, failure to document transactions properly, loss or disclosure of critical or commercial
sensitive data or personal identification information and systems failures. These events could result in direct
or indirect losses and adverse legal and regulatory proceedings, and could harm its reputation and operational
effectiveness.


-----

TIM has in place risk management procedures designed to detect, manage and monitor at a senior level the
evolution of these operational risks. However, there is no guarantee that these measures will be successful in
effectively controlling the operational risks that TIM faces and such failures could have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations and could harm its reputation.

**_System and network failures could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could harm_**
**_TIM’s reputation. In addition, its operations and reputation could be materially negatively affected by_**
**_cyber-security threats or TIM’s failure to comply with new data protection legislation. Regulation EU_**
**_2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) that is mandatory by 25 May 2018._**

TIM has executed a deep gap analysis, identified the main issues, and consequently planned and deployed a
master plan to reach full compliance with new General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679/EU (GDPR)
requirements, facilitated by the strength of the present data protection operative model yet to be adopted by
TIM.

TIM’s success largely depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its IT, network systems
and of certain hardware and datacenters that it manages for its clients. Its technical infrastructure (including
its network infrastructure for fixed-line and mobile telecommunications services) is vulnerable to damage or
interruption from technology failures, power loss, floods, windstorms, fires, terrorism, intentional
wrongdoing, human error and similar events. Unanticipated problems at TIM’s facilities, system failures,
hardware and software failures, computer viruses and hacker attacks, as well as terrorist attacks against its
infrastructure, which remains a target, could affect the quality of its services and cause service interruptions.
Any of these occurrences could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could negatively affect
TIM’s levels of customer satisfaction, reduce its customer base and harm its reputation.

In addition, TIM’s operations involve daily processing and storage of large amounts of customer data and
require uninterrupted, accurate, permanently available, real-time and safe transmission and storage of
customer and other data in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The proper functioning of,
including prevention of unauthorised access to its networks, systems, computers, applications and data, such
as customer accounting, network control, data hosting, cloud computing and other information technology
systems is critical to TIM’s operations. TIM may be held liable for the loss, release, disclosure or
inappropriate modification of the customer data stored on its equipment or carried by its networks. IT system
failure, interruption of service availability, industrial espionage, cyber-attack or data leakage, in particular
relating to customer data, could seriously limit TIM’s ability to service its clients, result in significant
compensation costs for which indemnification or insurance coverage may be only partially available, result
in a breach of laws and regulations under which it operates or leads to fines and could cause long-term
damage to its business and reputation.

**_TIM’s business depends on the upgrading of its existing networks._**

TIM must continue to maintain, improve and upgrade its existing networks in a timely and satisfactory
manner in order to retain and expand its customer base in each of its markets. A reliable and high quality
network is necessary to manage turnover by sustaining its customer base, to maintain strong customer brands
and reputation and to satisfy regulatory requirements, including minimum service requirements. The
maintenance and improvement of its existing networks depends on its ability to:

- upgrade the functionality of its networks to offer increasingly customised services to its customers;

- increase coverage in some of its markets;

- expand and maintain customer service, network management and administrative systems;

- expand the capacity of its existing fixed copper and mobile networks to cope with increased
bandwidth usage; and

- upgrade older systems and networks to adapt them to new technologies.


-----

In addition, due to rapid changes in the telecommunications industry, TIM’s network investments may prove
to be inadequate or may be superseded by new technological changes. Its network investments may also be
limited by market uptake and customer acceptance. If TIM fails to make adequate capital expenditures or
investments, or to properly and efficiently allocate such expenditures or investments, the performance of its
networks, both in real terms and relative to its competitors, could suffer, resulting in lower customer
satisfaction, diminution of brand strength and increased turnover.

Many of these tasks are not entirely under TIM’s control and may be affected by applicable regulation. If
TIM fails to maintain, improve or upgrade its networks, its services and products may be less attractive to
new customers and it may loses existing customers to competitors, which could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_TIM is continuously involved in disputes and litigation with regulators, competition authorities,_**
**_competitors and other parties and is the subject of a number of investigations by judicial authorities. The_**
**_ultimate outcome of such proceedings is generally uncertain. If any of these matters are resolved against_**
**_it, they could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations,_**
**_financial condition and cash flows in any particular period._**

TIM is subject to numerous risks relating to legal, tax, competition and regulatory proceedings in which it is
currently a party or which could develop in the future. It is also the subject of a number of investigations by
judicial authorities. Such proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable. Legal, tax,
competition and regulatory proceedings and investigations in which TIM is, or may become, involved (or
settlements thereof) may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on TIM’s results of
operations and/or financial condition and cash flows in any particular period. Furthermore, its involvement in
such proceedings and investigations may adversely affect its reputation.

If TIM, or another Group company, faces an adverse decision in any of the legal proceedings to which it is a
party, and is ordered to pay amounts greater than what it has recognised to cover potential liabilities, it may
face adverse effects with respect to it and/or its Group’s operations, financial position, income statement and
cash flows.

The final outcomes of those proceedings are generally uncertain. As of 31 March 2018, TIM had, on a
consolidated basis, recognised potential liabilities of 535 million euros. In recognising these liabilities, it
took into consideration the risks connected with each dispute and the relevant accounting standards, which
require reserves to be recognised where liabilities are probable and can be estimated reliably. The provisions
represent an estimate of the financial risk connected with the particular proceedings, in line with the relevant
accounting standards. Nonetheless, TIM may be obligated to meet liabilities linked to unsuccessful outcomes
for proceedings that were not taken into consideration when calculating those reserves and the provisions
made may not be sufficient to fully meet such obligations through use of its reserves. Such a development
could have adverse effects on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Risks associated with the use of internet by TIM’s customers could cause it to suffer losses and adversely_**
**_affect its reputation._**

Pursuant to applicable Italian regulation, TIM, as a host and provider of data transmission services, is
required to inform competent authorities without delay of any alleged illegal or illicit activity by its
customers of which it is aware. TIM must also provide the authorities with any information it has identifying
such customers. Any failure to comply with this obligation could cause it to become involved in civil
proceedings or could harm public perception of its brand and services. Any such event could result in legal
and/or regulatory proceedings, make it subject to direct or indirect monetary losses and could materially
harm its reputation.


-----

**_TIM is exposed to the risk of labour disputes, in particular as a result of its plan to restructure its labour_**
**_costs._**

TIM has undertaken a restructuring of various aspects of its workforce in an effort to improve standards of
service and expertise and achieve greater efficiency and reduce personnel costs. To that end, it entered into a
new union agreement on 7 September 2015 at Minister of Economic Development, where parties defined the
path and a set of measures to manage the staff and support the Plan deployment, and signed the agreements
related to voluntary collective dismissals of 21 September 2015 (expired in December 2016) and of 27
October 2015. On 8 November 2017, TIM signed another agreement related to voluntary dismissals.

The efforts undertaken with respect to this restructuring have continued in 2017. Such agreements provide
for a number of different measures to enable it to manage its workforce in line with its business plan and
include employment support schemes (e.g., the introduction of reduced hours and wages), known as contratti
_di solidarietà, as well voluntary relocation, early retirement measures and re-training._

With respect to the Plan, TIM is aiming to continue a transformation in order to facilitate stable growth in the
market. Therefore, it is currently in the process of executing the 2018 – 2020 Plan, presented and discussed
with Trade Unions on 13 March 2018. In this context, the guidelines related to personnel are to adopt
measures aimed at supporting TIM’s reorganisation and the transformation in the announced so-called
“DigiTIM”.

In relation to the CIGS procedure started by TIM on 17 May 2018, Unions and TIM are currently analysing
and discussing the Corporate reorganization project in the context of meetings arranged by Labor Minister,
with the desirable prospect of swiftly reaching an agreement.

Relations between TIM and its workers/trade unions are not generally adversarial and strikes or protests
involving a majority of workers are not common, however, such occurrences carry a moderate risk of
disruptions in work and/or reduced service. Generally, such occurrences would be expected negatively
impact its customers, its business and its reputation.

**FINANCIAL RISKS**

**_TIM’s leverage is such that deterioration in cash flow can change the expectations of its ability to repay_**
**_its debt and the inability to reduce its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business. Continuing_**
**_volatility in international credit markets may limit TIM’s ability to refinance its financial debt._**

As of 31 March 2018, TIM’s consolidated gross financial debt was 31,280 million euros, compared to
32,864 million euros on 31 December 2017. Its consolidated net financial debt was 26,494 million euros as
of 31 March 2018, compared to 26,091 million euros on 31 December 2017. TIM’s high leverage continues
to be a factor in its strategic decisions as it has been for a number of years and the reduction of its leverage
remains a key strategic objective. As a result, however, TIM is reliant on cost-cutting and free cash flow to
finance critical technology improvements and upgrades to its network, although it is taking steps to raise
additional capital to support critical investment.

Due to the competitive environment and the continuing weak economic conditions, there could be
deterioration in TIM’s income statement and financial measures used by rating agencies, such as Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch, to assess its ability to repay its debt and determine its credit quality.

Although rating downgrades do not generally have an immediate impact on outstanding debt, other than
outstanding debt instruments for which the interest expense is specifically impacted by such ratings,
downgrades could adversely impact its ability to refinance existing debt and could increase costs related to
refinancing existing debt and managing its derivatives portfolio.

Factors that are beyond TIM’s control such as deterioration in the telecommunications sector, unfavourable
fluctuations in interest rates and/or exchange rates, further disruptions in the capital markets, particularly
debt capital markets and continuing weakness in general economic conditions at the national level could


-----

have a significant effect on its ability to reduce its debt and refinance existing debt through further access to
the financial markets. Because debt reduction is one of TIM’s strategic objectives, failure to reduce debt
could be viewed negatively and could adversely affect its credit ratings.

The management and development of TIM’s business will require it to make significant further capital and
other investments. If it is unable to finance its capital investments as described above, TIM may need to
incur additional debt in order to finance such investment. Its future results of operations may be influenced
by its ability to enter into such transactions, which, in turn, will be determined by market conditions and
factors that are outside its control. In addition, if such transactions increase its leverage, it could adversely
affect its credit ratings.

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates and the performance of the equity markets in_**
**_general may adversely affect TIM’s results._**

In the past, TIM has made substantial international investments, significantly expanding its operations
outside of the Euro zone, particularly in Latin America.

TIM’s non-current operating assets are located as follows:

- Italy: as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectively, 48,591 million euros (87.4
percent. of total non-current operating assets) and 46,948 million euros (85.1 percent. of total noncurrent operating assets); and

- Outside of Italy: as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectively, 7,032 million euros
(12.6 percent. of total non-current operating assets) and 8,197 million euros (14.9 percent. of total
non-current operating assets). Non-current operating assets outside of Italy are primarily
denominated in Brazilian reais.

TIM generally hedges its foreign exchange exposure but does not cover conversion risk relating to its foreign
subsidiaries. According to its policies, the hedging of the foreign exchange exposure related to the financial
liabilities is mandatory. Movements in the euro exchange rates relative to other currencies (particularly the
Brazilian Real) may adversely affect its consolidated results. A rise in the value of the euro relative to other
currencies in certain countries in which TIM operates or have made investments will reduce the relative
value of the revenues or assets of its operations from those countries and, therefore, may adversely affect its
operating results or financial position.

In addition, TIM has raised, and may raise an increasing proportion, financing in currencies other than the
euro, principally U.S. dollars and British pound sterling. In accordance with its risk management policies,
TIM generally hedges the foreign currency risk exposure related to non-euro denominated liabilities, through
cross-currency and interest rate swaps.

Furthermore, as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, 29 percent of TIM’s consolidated gross debt
was subject to the accrual of interest at floating rates, net of derivative instruments hedging such risks. As of
31 December 2017, and 31 December 2016, we had derivative contracts in place for the sole management of
TIM’s interest rate risk, including interest rate swaps, for notional amounts of 5,919 million euros and 4,919
million euros, respectively. Any changes in interest rates that have not been adequately hedged by derivative
contracts may result in increased financial liabilities in connection with TIM’s floating rate debt, which may
have adverse effects on the results of its operations and cash flows.

An increase of sovereign spreads, and of the default risk they reflect, in the countries where TIM operates,
may affect the value of its assets in such countries.

TIM may also be exposed to financial risks such as those related to the performance of the equity markets in
general, and, more specifically, risks related to the performance of the share price of Group companies.


-----

On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the
EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The potential impact of Brexit will depend, in part, on the outcome of
tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations that remain ongoing. As a result of the referendum, global
markets have been adversely impacted, including an initial sharp decline in the value of the British pound
relative to the U.S. dollar and the euro. Since late 2017, the British pound has recovered some of its value
relative to the U.S. dollar and the euro, while the U.S. dollar has declined against various other currencies,
highlighting ongoing volatility in global currency exchange rates. Brexit-related uncertainty during the
negotiation period and the electoral success of anti-EU movements in other EU countries could result in
further instability in global financial markets and uncertainty with respect to national laws and regulations in
Europe. Brexit, as well as potential threats by other EU members to exit the EU, could adversely affect
TIM’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**COMPLIANCE RISKS**

**_Because TIM operates in a heavily regulated industry, regulatory decisions and changes in the regulatory_**
**_environment could adversely affect its business._**

TIM’s fixed and mobile telecommunications operations, in Italy and abroad, are subject to regulatory
requirements. As a member of the EU, Italy has adapted its regulatory legislation and rules for electronic
communications services to the framework established by the EU Parliament and Council.

Pursuant to the EU regulatory framework, the Italian regulator, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni
(AGCom), is required to identify operators with “Significant Market Power” (SMP) in the relevant markets
subject to regulation. On the basis of market analyses proceedings (Market Analyses), AGCom imposes
requirements necessary to address identified competition problems. Current requirements are mainly focused
on the regulation of TIM’s wholesale business, while the regulation of retail markets has been largely
withdrawn, with the exception of price tests on retail access offers (for telephone, broadband and
ultrabroadband services).

Within this regulatory framework, the main risks TIM faces include the lack of predictability concerning
both the timing of the regulatory proceedings and their final outcome and possible AGCom decisions that
apply retroactively and their potential impact on expected Group results and on the guidance presented to the
market (e.g., review of prices from prior years following the decisions of Administrative Courts, repricing
decisions, proceedings that impact technological decisions and return on investment).

In principle, a new round of Market Analyses should be conducted by AGCom every three years, in order to
deal with the evolution of market conditions and technology developments and set the rules for the
subsequent three-year period.

However, the regulatory review process does not always follow the expected schedule.

Regulation is a key factor in evaluating the likelihood of return on investments and therefore in deciding
where to invest. Regulatory uncertainty and regulatory changes imposed on TIM can impact its revenues and
can make it more difficult to make important investment decisions.

Moreover, a high level of disputes arising from operators challenging AGCom decisions before
Administrative Courts result in an even greater degree of uncertainty with respect to rules and economic
requirements.

The Italian Antitrust Authority, _Autorità Garante per la Concorrenza ed il Mercato (AGCM), may also_
intervene in TIM’s business, setting fines and/or imposing changes in its service provision operating
processes and in its offers.

In December 2015, TIM began the implementation of a new model that includes a number of structural
changes in the provision of its bottleneck access services (on both copper and fiber networks), aimed at
meeting the requirements and recommendations issued by AGCom, AGCM, the Supervisory Board (Organo


-----

_di Vigilanza per la Parità di Accesso) and the Supreme Administrative Court (Consiglio di Stato) (the New_
**Equivalence Model). The New Equivalence Model, will improve the current equality of access guarantees**
by means of a greater symmetry in organisation, processes, information systems and databases for the
provision of bottleneck access services in order to decrease future regulatory, competition and litigation
risks.

TIM Brasil Business Unit also is subject to extensive regulation. Its international operations, therefore, face
similar regulatory issues as it faces in Italy, including the possibility for regulators to impose obligations and
conditions on how it operates its businesses in Brazil as well as taking decisions that can have an adverse
effect on its results, including setting, and in particular, reducing the mobile termination rates it can charge.
As a result, the decisions of regulators or the implementation of new regulations in Brazil and the costs of its
compliance with any such decisions or new regulations, may limit its flexibility in responding to market
conditions, competition and changes in its cost base which could individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.

Due to the continuous evolution of the regulatory regime affecting various parts of its business in Italy and in
its international operations, TIM is unable to clearly predict the impact of any proposed or potential changes
in the regulatory environment in which it operates in Italy, Brazil and its other international markets.
Regulations in the telecommunications industry are constantly changing to adapt to new competition and
technology. Changes in laws, regulation or government policy could adversely affect TIM’s business and
competitiveness. In particular, its ability to compete effectively in its existing or new markets could be
adversely affected if regulators decide to expand the restrictions and obligations to which it is subject or
extend them to new services and markets. Finally, decisions by regulators regarding the granting,
amendment or renewal of its authorisations, or those of third parties, could adversely affect its future
operations in Italy and in other countries where TIM operates.

**_TIM operates under authorisations granted by government authorities._**

Many of TIM’s activities require authorisations from governmental authorities both in Italy and abroad.
These authorisations specify the types of services the operating company holding such authorisation may
provide. The continued existence and terms of TIM’s authorisations are subject to review by regulatory
authorities and to interpretation, modification or termination by these authorities. Although authorisation
renewal is not usually guaranteed, most authorisations do address the renewal process and terms that may be
affected by political and regulatory factors.

Many of these authorisations are revocable for public interest reasons. In addition, its current authorisations
to provide networks and services require that TIM satisfies certain obligations, including minimum specified
quality levels, service and coverage conditions. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in the
imposition of fines or even in the revocation or forfeiture of the authorisation. In addition, the need to meet
scheduled deadlines may require it to expend more resources than otherwise budgeted for a particular
network build-out.

Additional authorisations may also be required if TIM expands its services into new product areas, and such
authorisations may be related to auctions (e.g. in the assignment of spectrum right of use) or otherwise prove
expensive or require significant cash outlays, or have certain terms and conditions, such as requirements
related to coverage and pricing, with which TIM may not have previously had to comply. If TIM is unable to
obtain such authorisations within the expected timeframe, at a commercially acceptable cost, or if the
authorisations include onerous conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

In Brazil TIM also operates under an authorisations regime. As a result, it is obliged to maintain minimum
quality and service standards. Its failure to comply with the requirements imposed by Regulatory Agency for
Telecommunications—Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (ANATEL) and by the Brazilian
Government may result in the imposition of fines or other government actions, including the suspension of
the service commercialisation for a given period.

**_Actual or perceived health risks or other problems relating to mobile handsets or transmission masts_**
**_could lead to litigation or decreased mobile communications usage._**

The effects of, and any damage caused by, exposure to an electromagnetic field were and are the subject of
careful evaluations by the international scientific community, but until now there is no scientific evidence of
harmful effects on health. TIM cannot rule out that exposure to electromagnetic fields or other emissions
originating from wireless handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future.

TIM’s mobile communications business may be harmed as a result of these alleged health risks. For
example, the perception of these health risks could result in a lower number of customers, reduced usage per
customer or potential consumer liability. In addition, although Italian law already imposes strict limits in
relation to transmission equipment, these concerns may cause regulators to impose greater restrictions on the
construction of radio base station towers or other infrastructure, which may hinder the completion of network
build-outs and the commercial availability of new services and may require additional investments.

**_TIM faces the risk that its organisational policies and procedures embodied in the organisational model_**
**_prepared pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 may fail to prevent certain officers and employees from_**
**_engaging in unlawful conduct, for which it would be jointly liable._**

TIM has put in place an organisational model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, in order to create a
system of rules capable of preventing certain forms of unlawful conduct by senior management, executives
and employees generally that might result in liabilities for it. The organisational model has been adopted by
TIM and by its Italian subsidiaries. A specific version of the organisational model has been adopted by TIM
Participações pursuant to the anti-corruption Brazilian law (Lei 12.846/13).

The organisational model is continuously reviewed and must be kept up to date to reflect changes in
operations and in the regulatory environment. TIM has established a 231 steering committee to prepare and
consider proposals for changes to the model, for submission to the Board for approval.

Notwithstanding the existence of this model or any updates that TIM may make to it, there can be no
assurances that the model will function as designed, or that it will be considered adequate by any relevant
legal authority. If the model is inadequate or deemed to be so, and TIM was held liable for acts committed by
its senior management, executives and employees or are found otherwise non-compliant with the
requirements of the legislation, TIM may be ordered to pay a fine, its authorisations, licenses or concessions
may be suspended or revoked, and TIM may be prohibited from conducting business, contracting with the
Italian public administration, or advertising goods and services. Such developments would have adverse
effects on its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.


-----

**FACTORS WHICH ARE MATERIAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE MARKET**
**RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAMME.**

**_Risks related to the structure of a particular issue of Notes._**

A range of Notes may be issued under the Programme. A number of these Notes may have features which
contain particular risks for potential investors. Set out below is a description of the most common features:

**_Risks applicable to all Notes._**

_If the Issuer has the right to redeem any Notes at its option, this may limit the market value of the Notes_
_concerned and an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a manner which achieves_
_a similar effective return._

An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of Notes. During any period when the
Issuer may elect to redeem Notes, the market value of those Notes generally will not rise substantially above
the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.

The Issuer may be expected to redeem Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the
Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an
effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so
at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in the light of other
investments available at that time.

_If the Notes include a feature to convert the interest basis from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or vice versa,_
_this may affect the secondary market and the market value of the Notes concerned._

Fixed/Floating Rate Notes to which Condition 5.3 (Change of Interest Basis) applies are Notes which bear
interest at a rate that converts from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or from a floating rate to a fixed rate. Such
a feature to convert the interest basis, and any conversion of the interest basis, may affect the secondary
market in, and the market value of, such Notes as the change of interest basis may result in a lower interest
return for Noteholders. Where the Notes convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate, the spread on the
Fixed/Floating Rate Notes may be less favourable than then prevailing spreads on comparable Floating Rate
Notes tied to the same reference rate. In addition, the new floating rate at any time may be lower than the
rates on other Notes. Where the Notes convert from a floating rate to a fixed rate, the fixed rate may be lower
than then prevailing rates on those Notes and could affect the market value of an investment in the relevant
Notes.

_Notes which are issued at a substantial discount or premium may experience price volatility in response to_
_changes in market interest rates._

The market values of securities issued at a substantial discount (such as Zero Coupon Notes) or premium to
their principal amount tend to fluctuate more in relation to general changes in interest rates than do prices for
more conventional interest-bearing securities. Generally, the longer the remaining term of such securities,
the greater the price volatility as compared to more conventional interest-bearing securities with comparable
maturities.

_The regulation and reform of “benchmarks” may adversely affect the value of Notes linked to or referencing_
_such “benchmarks”_

Interest rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks”, (including LIBOR and EURIBOR) are the
subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these
reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such
benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which
cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any Notes linked to or


-----

referencing such a “benchmark”. The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the
EU on 29 June 2016 and applies from 1 January 2018. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to the provision
of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU. It
will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorised or registered (or, if non-EUbased, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognised or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain
uses by EU supervised entities of “benchmarks” of administrators that are not authorised or registered (or, if
non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognised or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on any Notes linked to or referencing LIBOR and
EURIBOR, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of LIBOR and EURIBOR are changed in order
to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things,
have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of
LIBOR and EURIBOR.

More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of
“benchmarks”, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of
a “benchmark” and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the
following effects on certain “benchmarks” LIBOR and EURIBOR: (i) discourage market participants from
continuing to administer or contribute to the “benchmark”; (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies
used in the “benchmark” or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the “benchmark”. Any of the above changes or
any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or
investigations, could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any Notes linked to or
referencing LIBOR and EURIBOR.

Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential
risks imposed by the Benchmarks Regulation reforms in making any investment decision with respect to any
Notes linked to or referencing LIBOR and EURIBOR.

_Future discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of Floating Rate Notes which reference_
_LIBOR_

On 27 July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates
LIBOR, announced that it does not intend to continue to persuade, or use its powers to compel, panel banks
to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement
indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. It is not possible
to predict whether, and to what extent, panel banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the
administrator of LIBOR going forwards. This may cause LIBOR to perform differently than it did in the past
and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

Investors should be aware that, if LIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on
Floating Rate Notes which reference LIBOR will be determined for the relevant period by the fall-back
provisions applicable to such Notes. Depending on the manner in which the LIBOR rate is to be determined
under the Terms and Conditions, this may (i) if ISDA Determination applies, be reliant upon the provision
by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate which, depending on market circumstances,
may not be available at the relevant time or (ii) if Screen Rate Determination applies, result in the effective
application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available.
Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and return on, any Floating
Rate Notes which reference LIBOR.

**_Risks related to Notes generally._**

Set out below is a description of material risks relating to the Notes generally.


-----

**_The Conditions of the Notes contain provisions which may permit their modification without the consent_**
**_of all investors and confer significant discretions on the Trustee which may be exercised without the_**
**_consent of the Noteholders and without regard to the individual interests of particular Noteholders._**

The Conditions contain provisions for convening meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their
interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders
who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the
majority.

The Conditions also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders and without regard to
the interests of particular Noteholders, agree to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of
any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of the Notes or (ii) determine without the consent of
the Noteholders that any Event of Default or potential Event of Default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the
substitution of another company as principal debtor under any Notes in place of the Issuer, in the
circumstances described in Condition 15.

**_The Notes may be subject to withholding taxes in circumstances where the Issuer is not obliged to make_**
**_gross up payments and this would result in holders receiving less interest than expected and could_**
**_significantly adversely affect their return on the Notes._**

**_The value of the Notes could be adversely affected by a change in English law or administrative practice._**

The Conditions are based on English law in effect as at the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus. No
assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English law or
administrative practice after the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus and any such change could
materially adversely impact the value of any Notes affected by it.

**_Investors who hold less than the Minimum Specified Denomination may be unable to sell their Notes and_**
**_may be adversely affected if definitive Notes are subsequently required to be issued._**

In relation to any issue of Notes which have denominations consisting of a minimum Specified
Denomination plus one or more higher integral multiples of another smaller amount, it is possible that such
Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of the minimum Specified Denomination that are not integral
multiples of such minimum Specified Denomination. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such
amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum Specified Denomination in his account with the
relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder of such holding without first purchasing a
principal amount of Notes at or in excess of the minimum Specified Denomination such that its holding
amounts to a Specified Denomination. Further, a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an
amount which is less than the minimum Specified Denomination in his account with the relevant clearing
system at the relevant time may not receive a definitive Note in respect of such holding (should definitive
Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of the minimum
Specified Denomination such that its holding amounts to a Specified Denomination.

If definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Notes which have a denomination that
is not an integral multiple of the minimum Specified Denomination may be illiquid and difficult to trade.

**_Investing in the Notes may negatively impact on the “Aiuto alla Crescita Economica” (ACE) benefit_**
**_available to certain Italian resident noteholders (or Italian permanent establishments of non-resident_**
**_noteholders)._**

Effective as of the fiscal year following the fiscal year that was current on 31 December 2015, Article 1(550)
of Law No. 232 of 11 December 2016 (Finance Act 2017) added paragraph 6-bis to Article 1 of Law Decree
No. 201 of 6 December 2011, converted into Law No. 214 of 22 December 2011. Under this new rule, the
base upon which the so-called “ACE benefit” set forth in Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of 6 December
2011 is computed is reduced by an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (i) the aggregate
book value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari) other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial


-----

statements for the relevant fiscal year and (ii) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari)
other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial statements for the fiscal year that was current on 31
December 2010. The relevant securities (titoli e valori mobiliari) are defined in Article 1(1-bis) of
Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998 (Financial Services Act). Only Italian resident persons
carrying on an entrepreneurial activity (and in particular Italian resident corporations) and Italian permanent
establishments of non-resident persons can enjoy the “ACE Benefit”. The new restrictive rule enacted by
Finance Act 2017 applies only to taxpayers that do not carry out insurance or financial activities listed in
Section K of the 2007 ATECOFIN Index (except for non-financial holding companies).

Because of this new rule, the investment in the Notes by Italian resident noteholders (other than financial and
insurance companies) might reduce the amount of the “ACE Benefit” that they may be able to enjoy.
Noteholders are thus urged to consult their own tax advisers concerning the implications that holding the
Notes may have on the “ACE Benefit” available to them.

**Risks related to the market generally.**

Set out below is a description of the material market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk.

**_An active secondary market in respect of the Notes may never be established or may be illiquid and this_**
**_would adversely affect the value at which an investor could sell his Notes._**

The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market for
the Notes does develop, it may not be very liquid. In addition, liquidity may be limited if the Issuer makes
large allocations to a limited number of investors. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes
easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a
developed secondary market. This is particularly the case for Notes that are especially sensitive to interest
rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been
structured to meet the investment requirements of limited categories of investors. These types of Notes
generally would have a more limited secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt
securities.

**_If an investor holds Notes which are not denominated in the investor’s home currency, he will be exposed_**
**_to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value of his holding. In addition, the imposition_**
**_of exchange controls in relation to any Notes could result in an investor not receiving payments on those_**
**_Notes._**

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes and the Guarantor will make any payments under the
Guarantee in the Specified Currency. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an
investor’s financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the **Investor’s**
**Currency) other than the Specified Currency. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly**
change (including changes due to devaluation of the Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investor’s
Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor’s Currency may impose or modify
exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor’s Currency relative to the Specified Currency
would decrease (1) the Investor’s Currency equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor’s Currency
equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor’s Currency equivalent market
value of the Notes.

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that
could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuers, the Guarantor to make
payments in respect of the Notes. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected,
or no interest or principal.


-----

**_The value of Fixed Rate Notes may be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates._**

Investment in Fixed Rate Notes involves the risk that if market interest rates subsequently increase above the
rate paid on the Fixed Rate Notes, this will adversely affect the value of the Fixed Rate Notes.

**_Credit ratings assigned to the Issuers, the Guarantor or any Notes may not reflect all the risks associated_**
**_with an investment in those Notes._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Issuers, the Guarantor or the
Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional
factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating
agency at any time.

In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings
for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and
registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended, subject to
transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). Such general restriction will also apply in the
case of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed
by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with
the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been
withdrawn or suspended subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). The list of
registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority
(ESMA) on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the status of
the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures
being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated ESMA list. Certain
information with respect to the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the cover of this EMTN
Programme Prospectus.

**_Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments._**

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review
or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine
whether and to what extent (i) Notes are legal investments for it, (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for
various types of borrowing and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial
institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate
treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.


-----

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME**

Under the Programme, the Issuers may from time to time issue Notes denominated in any currency, subject
as set out herein. An overview of the terms and conditions of the Programme and the Notes appears below.
The applicable terms of any Notes will be agreed between the relevant Issuer and the relevant Dealer prior to
the issue of the Notes and will be set out in the terms and conditions of the Notes (the Conditions) endorsed
on, attached to, or incorporated by reference into, the Notes, as modified by the applicable Final Terms
attached to, or endorsed on, such Notes, as more fully described under “Form of the Notes” below.

This EMTN Programme Prospectus and any supplement to this EMTN Programme Prospectus will only be
valid for admission of the Notes to trading on the regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
listing of the Notes on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange during the period of 12 months
from the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus in an aggregate principal amount which, when added to
the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of all Notes previously or simultaneously issued under the
Programme, does not exceed €20,000,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies. For the purpose of
calculating the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Programme from
time to time:

(a) the euro equivalent of Notes denominated in another Specified Currency (as specified in the
applicable Final Terms in relation to the relevant Notes, described under “Form of the Notes”) shall
be determined, at the discretion of the relevant Issuer, either as of the date on which agreement is
reached for the issue of Notes or on the preceding day on which commercial banks and foreign
exchange markets are open for business in London, in each case on the basis of the spot rate for the
sale of the euro against the purchase of such Specified Currency in the London foreign exchange
market quoted by any leading international bank selected by the Issuer on the relevant day of
calculation;

(b) the euro equivalent of Zero Coupon Notes (as specified in the applicable Final Terms in relation to
the relevant Notes, described under “Form of the Notes”) and other Notes issued at a discount or a
premium shall be calculated in the manner specified above by reference to the net proceeds received
by the relevant Issuer for the relevant issue.

**FORM OF THE NOTES**

Each Tranche of Notes will be in bearer form and will be initially issued in the form of a temporary global
note (a Temporary Global Note) or, if so specified in the applicable Final Terms, a permanent global note
(a **Permanent Global Note** and, together with a Temporary Global Note, each a **Global Note) which, in**
either case, will:

(a) if the Global Notes are intended to be issued in new global note (NGN) form, as stated in the
applicable Final Terms, be delivered on or prior to the original issue date of the Tranche to a
common safekeeper (the **Common Safekeeper) for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (Euroclear) and**
Clearstream Banking, S.A. (Clearstream, Luxembourg); and

(b) if the Global Notes are not intended to be issued in NGN Form, be delivered on or prior to the
original issue date of the Tranche to a common depositary (the Common Depositary) for, Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Where the Global Notes issued in respect of any Tranche are in NGN form, the applicable Final Terms will
also indicate whether or not such Global Notes are intended to be held in a manner which would allow
Eurosystem eligibility. Any indication that the Global Notes are to be so held does not necessarily mean that
the Notes of the relevant Tranche will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy
and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem either upon issue or at any times during their life as such
recognition depends upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility criteria. The Common Safekeeper for
NGNs will either be Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or another entity approved by Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Whilst any Note is represented by a Temporary Global Note, payments of principal, interest (if any) and any
other amount payable in respect of the Notes due prior to the Exchange Date (as defined below) will be made
(against presentation of the Temporary Global Note if the Temporary Global Note is not intended to be
issued in NGN form) only to the extent that certification (in a form to be provided) to the effect that the
beneficial owners of interests in the Temporary Global Note are not U.S. persons or persons who have
purchased for resale to any U.S. person, as required by U.S. Treasury regulations, has been received by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as applicable,
has given a like certification (based on the certifications it has received) to the Principal Paying Agent.

On and after the date (the **Exchange Date) which is 40 days after a Temporary Global Note is issued,**
interests in such Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge) upon a request as described
therein either for (i) interests in a Permanent Global Note of the same Series or (ii) for definitive Notes of the
same Series with, where applicable, interest coupons and talons attached (as indicated in the applicable Final
Terms), in each case against certification of beneficial ownership as described above unless such
certification has already been given. The holder of a Temporary Global Note will not be entitled to collect
any payment of interest, principal or other amount due on or after the Exchange Date unless, upon due
certification, exchange of the Temporary Global Note for an interest in a Permanent Global Note or for
definitive Notes is improperly withheld or refused.

Payments of principal, interest (if any) or any other amounts on a Permanent Global Note will be made
through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (against presentation or surrender (as the case may be)
of the Permanent Global Note if the Permanent Global Note is not intended to be issued in NGN form)
without any requirement for certification.

The applicable Final Terms will specify that a Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge),
in whole but not in part, for definitive Notes with, where applicable, interest coupons and talons attached
upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event. For these purposes, Exchange Event means that (i) an Event of
Default (as defined in Condition 10) has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the relevant Issuer has been notified
that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business for a continuous period of
14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently


-----

to cease business or have in fact done so and no successor clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is
available or (iii) the relevant Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not
be suffered were the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note in definitive form and a certificate to
such effect signed by a duly authorised representative of the relevant Issuer is given to the Trustee. The
relevant Issuer will promptly give notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14 if an Exchange
Event occurs. In the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such Permanent Global Note) or the
Trustee may give notice to the Principal Paying Agent requesting exchange and, in the event of the
occurrence of an Exchange Event as described in (iii) above, the relevant Issuer may also give notice to the
Principal Paying Agent requesting exchange. Any such exchange shall occur not later than 45 days after the
date of receipt of the first relevant notice by the Principal Paying Agent.

The following legend will appear on all Notes (other than Temporary Global Notes) and on all interest
coupons relating to such Notes where TEFRA D Rules are specified in the applicable Final Terms:

“ANY UNITED STATES PERSON WHO HOLDS THIS OBLIGATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO
LIMITATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES INCOME TAX LAWS, INCLUDING THE
LIMITATIONS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 165(j) AND 1287(a) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE
CODE.”

The sections referred to provide that United States holders, with certain exceptions, will not be entitled to
deduct any loss on Notes or interest coupons and will not be entitled to capital gains treatment in respect of
any gain on any sale, disposition, redemption or payment of principal in respect of Notes or interest coupons.

Notes which are represented by a Global Note will only be transferable in accordance with the rules and
procedures for the time being of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.

Pursuant to the Agency Agreement (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”), the Principal
Paying Agent shall arrange that, where a further Tranche of Notes is issued which is intended to form a
single Series with an existing Tranche of Notes on a date subsequent to the Issue Date of such further
Tranche, the Notes of such further Tranche shall be assigned a common code and ISIN which are different
from the common code and ISIN assigned to Notes of any other Tranche of the same Series until such time
as the Tranches are consolidated and form a single Series, which shall not be prior to the expiry of the
distribution compliance period (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) applicable to the Notes
of such further Tranche.

Any reference herein to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall, whenever the context so permits,
be deemed to include a reference to any additional or alternative clearing system specified in the applicable
Final Terms.

No Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the relevant Issuer or (in the
case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed,
fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.

The Issuers and the Guarantor may agree with any Dealer and the Trustee that Notes may be issued in a form
not contemplated by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, in which event a supplement to this EMTN
Programme Prospectus or a new EMTN Programme Prospectus will be made available which will describe
the effect of the agreement reached in relation to such Notes.


-----

**APPLICABLE FINAL TERMS**

_Set out below is the form of Final Terms which will be completed for each Tranche of Notes issued under the_
_Programme with a denomination of at least €100,000 (or its equivalent in another currency)._

2[PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the European Economic Area (EEA). For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, **MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as**
amended, the **Insurance Mediation Directive), where that customer would not qualify as a professional**
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.]

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the**
purposes of [the/each] manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of
the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in [Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID II)][MiFID II]; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a **distributor) should**
take into consideration the manufacturer['s/s'] target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer['s/s'] target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

_at the time of issue but, if not so permitted and agreed, such definitive Note will have endorsed thereon or_
_attached thereto such Terms and Conditions. The applicable Final Terms (or the relevant provisions thereof)_
_will be endorsed upon, or attached to, each Global Note and definitive Note. Reference should be made to_
_“Form of the Notes” for a description of the content of the Final Terms which will specify which of such_

guarantor (in such capacity, the **Guarantor) of Notes issued by TI Finance), TI Finance and Deutsche**

(b) any Global Note; and

(c) any definitive Notes issued in exchange for a Global Note.

The Notes and the Coupons (as defined below) have the benefit of an Agency Agreement (such Agency

dated 8 June 2018 and made between TIM (in its capacity both as an Issuer and as the Guarantor), TI
Finance, the Trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as issuing and principal paying agent and agent

and shall, in relation to any Notes represented by a Global Note, be construed as provided below) and the

include the holders of the Talons), in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed.

As used herein, **Tranche means Notes which are identical in all respects (including as to listing and**
admission to trading) and Series means a Tranche of Notes together with any further Tranche or Tranches of
Notes which are (a) expressed to be consolidated and form a single series and (b) have the same terms and

payment of interest thereon and the date from which interest starts to accrue.

such Noteholder must produce evidence satisfactory to the relevant Issuer and the Trustee or, as the case may
be, the relevant Agent as to its holding of such Notes and identity. The Noteholders and the Couponholders
are deemed to have notice of, and are entitled to the benefit of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed, the
Agency Agreement and the applicable Final Terms which are applicable to them. The statements in these
Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed.

Words and expressions defined in the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or used in the applicable Final
Terms shall have the same meanings where used in these Conditions unless the context otherwise requires or

the Agency Agreement and the applicable Final Terms, the applicable Final Terms will prevail.

and monetary union pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the **TFEU), as**

(the Specified Currency) and the denominations (the Specified Denomination(s)) specified in the
applicable Final Terms. Notes of one Specified Denomination may not be exchanged for Notes of
another Specified Denomination.

This Note may be a Fixed Rate Note, a Floating Rate Note, a Zero Coupon Note or a combination of
any of the foregoing, depending upon the Interest Basis shown in the applicable Final Terms.

Definitive Notes are issued with Coupons attached, unless they are Zero Coupon Notes in which
case references to Coupons and Couponholders in these Conditions are not applicable. Definitive
Notes will be executed by a duly authorised representative of TIM in the case of Notes issued by
TIM or by any two directors of TI Finance in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance.

Subject as set out below, title to the Notes and Coupons will pass by delivery. The relevant Issuer,
the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance), the Trustee and any Agent will (except as
otherwise required by law) deem and treat the bearer of any Note or Coupon as the absolute owner
thereof (whether or not overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon or
notice of any previous loss or theft thereof) for all purposes but, in the case of any Global Note,
without prejudice to the provisions set out in the next succeeding paragraph.


-----

For so long as any of the Notes is represented by a Global Note held on behalf of Euroclear Bank
SA/NV (Euroclear) and/or Clearstream Banking, S.A. (Clearstream, Luxembourg), each person
(other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being shown in the records
of Euroclear or of Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular nominal amount of such
Notes (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg as to the nominal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any person shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error or proven error) shall be
treated by the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance), the Trustee
and the Agents as the holder of such nominal amount of such Notes for all purposes other than with
respect to the payment of principal or interest on such nominal amount of such Notes, for which
purpose the bearer of the relevant Global Note shall be treated by the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor
(in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance), the Trustee and any Agent as the holder of such nominal
amount of such Notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Global Note and
the expressions **Noteholder and** **holder of Notes and related expressions shall be construed**
accordingly. In determining whether a particular person is entitled to a particular nominal amount of
Notes as aforesaid, the Trustee may rely on such evidence and/or information and/or certification as
it shall, in its absolute discretion, think fit and, if it does so rely, such evidence and/or information
and/or certification shall, in the absence of an error which is manifest or, in the opinion of the
Trustee, proven, be conclusive and binding on all concerned.

Notes which are represented by a Global Note will be transferable only in accordance with the rules
and procedures for the time being of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.

References to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall, whenever the context so permits, be
deemed to include a reference to any additional or alternative clearing system specified in Part B of
the applicable Final Terms or as may otherwise be approved by the relevant Issuer, the Agent and
the Trustee.

**2.** **STATUS OF THE NOTES AND THE GUARANTEE**

**2.1** **Status of the Notes**

The Notes and any related Coupons are unconditional, unsubordinated and (subject to the provisions
of Condition 3) unsecured obligations of the relevant Issuer and rank pari passu among themselves
and (save as aforesaid and for certain obligations required to be preferred by law) equally with all
other unsecured obligations (other than subordinated obligations, if any) of the relevant Issuer, from
time to time outstanding.

**2.2** **Status of the Guarantee**

In the case of Notes issued by TI Finance, the payment of principal and interest in respect of the
Notes and all other moneys payable by the Issuer under or pursuant to the Trust Deed has been
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Guarantor in the Trust Deed (the **Guarantee).**
The Guarantor guarantees the payment of such amount when such amount becomes due and payable,
whether at the stated maturity of the Notes, by declaration or acceleration, call for redemption or
otherwise. The obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantee are unconditional, unsubordinated
and (subject to the provisions of Condition 3) unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and (save as
aforesaid and for certain obligations required to be preferred by law) rank equally with all other
unsecured obligations (other than subordinated obligations, if any) of the Guarantor, from time to
time outstanding.

**3.** **RESTRICTIONS ON SECURITY INTERESTS**

So long as any Note remains outstanding, the relevant Issuer and (in the case of Notes issued by TI
Finance) the Guarantor shall not create or permit to subsist any Security Interest other than Permitted
Encumbrances upon the whole or any part of their present or future revenues or assets to secure any


-----

Capital Markets Indebtedness without at the same time or prior thereto taking any and all action
necessary to ensure that:

(i) all amounts payable by it under the Notes, any relative Coupons and the Trust Deed are
secured by the Security Interest equally and rateably with the Capital Markets Indebtedness
to the satisfaction of the Trustee; or

(ii) such other Security Interest or other arrangement (whether or not it includes the giving of a
Security Interest) is provided either (A) as the Trustee in its absolute discretion deems not
materially less beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders or (B) as is approved by an
Extraordinary Resolution (which is defined in the Trust Deed as a resolution duly passed by
a majority of not less than three-quarters of the votes cast thereon) of the Noteholders.

confined to that asset (and/or shares and/or shareholder loans);

(h) encumbrances arising out of the refinancing of any Capital Markets Indebtedness secured by

**4.** **MERGERS AND SIMILAR EVENTS**

So long as any Note remains outstanding, the relevant Issuer and (in the case of Notes issued by TI
Finance) the Guarantor may each consolidate or merge with another company or firm, sell or lease
all or substantially all of their respective assets to another company or buy or lease all or
substantially all of the assets of another company, provided that the relevant Issuer and (as the case
may be) the Guarantor shall not take any of these actions unless:

(i) where the relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor
merges out of existence or sells or leases all or substantially all of its assets, the other
company assumes all the then existing obligations of the relevant Issuer or (as the case may
be) the Guarantor (including, without limitation, all obligations under the Notes and the
Trust Deed), either by law or contractual arrangements;

interest or other amounts paid to a non-Italian resident legal entity or a non-Italian resident
individual which is resident in a country which does not allow for a satisfactory exchange of
information with Italy; and

(iii) the merger, sale or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant Issuer or (as
the case may be) the Guarantor will not be an Event of Default (as defined in Condition 10)
and no Event of Default or other event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or
other condition (including, without limitation, certification from the Trustee), would be an
Event of Default has occurred and is outstanding.

As long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and/or listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in the case of such
merger or consolidation, TIM will advise the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, a supplement to the
EMTN Programme base prospectus or, where so required by the relevant authority, a new EMTN
Programme base prospectus will be prepared and the Noteholders will be notified in accordance with
Condition 14.

**5.** **INTEREST**

**5.1** **Interest on Fixed Rate Notes**

Each Fixed Rate Note bears interest from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date at the
rate(s) per annum equal to the Rate(s) of Interest. Interest will be payable in arrear on the Interest
Payment Date(s) in each year up to (and including) the Maturity Date.

If the Notes are in definitive form, except as provided in the applicable Final Terms, the amount of
interest payable on each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Fixed Interest Period ending on (but
excluding) such date will amount to the Fixed Coupon Amount. Payments of interest on any Interest
Payment Date will, if so specified in the applicable Final Terms, amount to the Broken Amount so
specified.


-----

As used in these Conditions, **Fixed Interest Period means the period from (and including) an**
Interest Payment Date (or the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first)
Interest Payment Date.

Except in the case of Notes in definitive form where an applicable Fixed Coupon Amount or Broken
Amount is specified in the applicable Final Terms, interest shall be calculated in respect of any
period by applying the Rate of Interest to:

(A) in the case of Fixed Rate Notes which are represented by a Global Note, the aggregate
outstanding nominal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes represented by such Global Note; or

(B) in the case of Fixed Rate Notes in definitive form, the Calculation Amount;

and, in each case, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction, and rounding the
resultant figure to the nearest sub-unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such sub-unit
being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. Where the
Specified Denomination of a Fixed Rate Note in definitive form is a multiple of the Calculation
Amount, the amount of interest payable in respect of such Fixed Rate Note shall be the product of
the amount (determined in the manner provided above) for the Calculation Amount and the amount
by which the Calculation Amount is multiplied to reach the Specified Denomination, without any
further rounding.

**Day Count Fraction means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest in accordance**
with this Condition 5.1:

(i) if “Actual/Actual (ICMA)” is specified in the applicable Final Terms:

(A) in the case of Notes where the number of days in the relevant period from (and
including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Interest
Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the relevant payment date (the **Accrual**
**Period) is equal to or shorter than the Determination Period during which the**
Accrual Period ends, the number of days in such Accrual Period divided by the
product of (1) the number of days in such Determination Period and (2) the number
of Determination Dates (as specified in the applicable Final Terms) that would occur
in one calendar year; or

(B) in the case of Notes where the Accrual Period is longer than the Determination
Period during which the Accrual Period ends, the sum of:

(1) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the Determination
Period in which the Accrual Period begins divided by the product of (x) the
number of days in such Determination Period and (y) the number of
Determination Dates that would occur in one calendar year; and

(2) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the next Determination
Period divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such
Determination Period and (y) the number of Determination Dates that would
occur in one calendar year; and

(ii) if “30/360” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the number of days in the period from
(and including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Interest
Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the relevant payment date (such number of days
being calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 30-day months) divided by 360.

In these Conditions:


-----

**Determination Period means each period from (and including) a Determination Date to (but**
excluding) the next Determination Date (including, where either the Interest Commencement Date or
the final Interest Payment Date is not a Determination Date, the period commencing on the first
Determination Date prior to, and ending on the first Determination Date falling after, such date); and

**sub-unit means, with respect to any currency other than euro, the lowest amount of such currency**
that is available as legal tender in the country of such currency and means, with respect to euro, one
cent.

**5.2** **Interest on Floating Rate Notes**

**(a)** **Interest Payment Dates**

Each Floating Rate Note bears interest from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date and
such interest will be payable in arrear on either:

(i) the Specified Interest Payment Date(s) in each year specified in the applicable Final Terms;
or

(ii) if no Specified Interest Payment Date(s) is/are specified in the applicable Final Terms, each
date (each such date, together with each Specified Interest Payment Date, an **Interest**
**Payment Date) which falls on the number of months or other period specified as the**
Specified Period in the applicable Final Terms after the preceding Interest Payment Date or,
in the case of the first Interest Payment Date, after the Interest Commencement Date.

Such interest will be payable in respect of each Interest Period. In the Conditions, Interest Period
means the period from (and including) an Interest Payment Date (or the Interest Commencement
Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest Payment Date.

If a Business Day Convention is specified in the applicable Final Terms and (x) if there is no
numerically corresponding day in the calendar month in which an Interest Payment Date should
occur or (y) if any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day,
then, if the Business Day Convention specified is:

(A) in any case where Specified Periods are specified in accordance with Condition 5.2(a)(ii)
above, the Floating Rate Convention, such Interest Payment Date (a) in the case of (x)
above, shall be the last day that is a Business Day in the relevant month and the provisions
of (ii) below shall apply mutatis mutandis or (b) in the case of (y) above, shall be postponed
to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next calendar
month, in which event (i) such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the
immediately preceding Business Day and (ii) each subsequent Interest Payment Date shall
be the last Business Day in the month which falls in the Specified Period after the preceding
applicable Interest Payment Date occurred; or

(B) the Following Business Day Convention, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to
the next day which is a Business Day; or

(C) the Modified Following Business Day Convention, such Interest Payment Date shall be
postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next
calendar month, in which event such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the
immediately preceding Business Day; or

(D) the Preceding Business Day Convention, such Interest Payment Date shall be brought
forward to the immediately preceding Business Day.

In these Conditions, Business Day means a day which is both:


-----

(a) a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are
open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency
deposits) in any Additional Business Centre specified in the applicable Final Terms; and

(b) either (1) in relation to any sum payable in a Specified Currency other than euro, a day on
which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for
general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in
the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant Specified Currency (if other than
any Additional Business Centre and which, if the Specified Currency is Australian dollars or
New Zealand dollars, shall be Sydney and Auckland, respectively) or (2) in relation to any
sum payable in euro, a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System (the TARGET2 System) is open.

**(b)** **Rate of Interest**

The Rate of Interest payable from time to time in respect of Floating Rate Notes will be determined
in the manner specified in the applicable Final Terms.

(i) ISDA Determination for Floating Rate Notes

Where ISDA Determination is specified in the applicable Final Terms as the manner in
which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period
will be the relevant ISDA Rate plus or minus (as indicated in the applicable Final Terms) the
Margin (if any). For the purposes of this subparagraph (i), ISDA Rate for an Interest Period
means a rate equal to the Floating Rate that would be determined by the Principal Paying
Agent under an interest rate swap transaction if the Principal Paying Agent were acting as
Calculation Agent for that swap transaction under the terms of an agreement incorporating
the 2006 ISDA Definitions, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. and as amended and updated as at the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the
Notes (the ISDA Definitions) and under which:

(A) the Floating Rate Option is as specified in the applicable Final Terms;

(B) the Designated Maturity (Designated Maturity) is a period specified in the
applicable Final Terms; and

(C) the relevant Reset Date is at the day specified in the applicable Final Terms.

For the purposes of this subparagraph (i), Floating Rate, Calculation Agent, Floating Rate
**Option, Designated Maturity and Reset Date have the meanings given to those terms in the**
ISDA Definitions.

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Final Terms the Minimum Rate of Interest shall be
deemed to be zero.

(ii) Screen Rate Determination for Floating Rate Notes

Where Screen Rate Determination is specified in the applicable Final Terms as the manner
in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period
will, subject as provided below, be either:

(A) the offered quotation; or

(B) the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005
being rounded upwards) of the offered quotations,


-----

(expressed as a percentage rate per annum) for the Reference Rate (being either the London
interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the Euro-zone interbank offered rate (EURIBOR), as
specified in the applicable Final Terms) which appears or appear, as the case may be, on the
Relevant Screen Page (or such replacement page on that service which displays the
information) as at 11.00 a.m. (London time, in the case of LIBOR, or Brussels time, in the
case of EURIBOR) on the Interest Determination Date in question plus or minus (as
indicated in the applicable Final Terms) the Margin (if any), all as determined by the
Principal Paying Agent. If five or more of such offered quotations are available on the
Relevant Screen Page, the highest (or, if there is more than one such highest quotation, one
only of such quotations) and the lowest (or, if there is more than one such lowest quotation,
one only of such quotations) shall be disregarded by the Principal Paying Agent for the
purpose of determining the arithmetic mean (rounded as provided above) of such offered
quotations.

The Agency Agreement contains provisions for determining the Rate of Interest in the event
that the Relevant Screen Page is not available or if, in the case of (A) above, no such offered
quotation appears or, in the case of (B) above, fewer than three such offered quotations
appear, in each case as at the time specified in the preceding paragraph. In particular, if the
Relevant Screen Page is not available or if, in the case of sub-clause 5.2(b)(B) no offered
quotation appears or, in the case of sub-clause 5.2(b)(B), fewer than three offered quotations
appear, in each case as at the Specified Time, the Issuer shall request each of the Reference
Banks to provide the Principal Paying Agent with its offered quotation (expressed as a
percentage rate _per annum) for the Reference Rate at approximately 11.00 a.m. (London_
time, in the case of LIBOR, or Brussels time, in the case of EURIBOR) on the Interest
Determination Date in question. If two or more of the Reference Banks provide the Principal
Paying Agent with offered quotations, the Rate of Interest for the Interest Period shall be the
arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place with 0.000005 being
rounded upwards) of the offered quotations plus or minus (as appropriate) the Margin (if
any), all as determined by the Principal Paying Agent.

**(c)** **Minimum Rate of Interest and/or Maximum Rate of Interest**

If the applicable Final Terms specifies a Minimum Rate of Interest for any Interest Period, then, in
the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period determined in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (b) above is less than such Minimum Rate of Interest, the Rate of
Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Minimum Rate of Interest.

If the applicable Final Terms specifies a Maximum Rate of Interest for any Interest Period, then, in
the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period determined in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (b) above is greater than such Maximum Rate of Interest, the Rate of
Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Maximum Rate of Interest.

**(d)** **Determination of Rate of Interest and calculation of Interest Amounts**

The Principal Paying Agent will, at or as soon as practicable after each time at which the Rate of
Interest is to be determined, determine the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period.

The Principal Paying Agent will calculate the amount of interest (the Interest Amount) payable on
the Floating Rate Notes for the relevant Interest Period by applying the Rate of Interest to:

(i) in the case of Floating Rate Notes which are represented by a Global Note, the aggregate
outstanding nominal amount of the Notes represented by such Global Note; or

(ii) in the case of Floating Rate Notes in definitive form, the Calculation Amount;


-----

and, in each case, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction and rounding the
resultant figure to the nearest sub-unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such sub-unit
being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. Where the
Specified Denomination of a Floating Rate Note in definitive form is a multiple of the Calculation
Amount, the Interest Amount payable in respect of such Note shall be the product of the amount
(determined in the manner provided above) for the Calculation Amount and the amount by which the
Calculation Amount is multiplied to reach the Specified Denomination without any further rounding.

**Day Count Fraction means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest in accordance**
with this Condition 5.2:

(i) if “Actual/Actual (ISDA)” or “Actual/Actual” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the
actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365 (or, if any portion of that Interest
Period falls in a leap year, the sum of (I) the actual number of days in that portion of the
Interest Period falling in a leap year divided by 366 and (II) the actual number of days in that
portion of the Interest Period falling in a non-leap year divided by 365);

(ii) if “Actual/365 (Fixed)” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the actual number of days
in the Interest Period divided by 365;

(iii) if “Actual/365 (Sterling)” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the actual number of
days in the Interest Period divided by 365 or, in the case of an Interest Payment Date falling
in a leap year, 366;

(iv) if “Actual/360” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the actual number of days in the
Interest Period divided by 360;

(v) if “30/360”, “360/360” or “Bond Basis” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the
number of days in the Interest Period divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as
follows:


Day Count Fraction =

where:



[360 x (Y2 - Y1)]  [30 x (M2 - M1)]  (D2 - D1)

360


Y1 is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest Period falls;

Y2 is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day
of the Interest Period falls;

M1 is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest Period
falls;

M2 is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following
the last day of the Interest Period falls;

D1 is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless such
number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and

D2 is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last day included
in the Interest Period, unless such number would be 31 and D1 is greater than 29, in which
case D2 will be 30;

(vi) if “30E/360” or “Eurobond Basis” is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the number of
days in the Interest Period divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows:


-----

Day Count Fraction =

where:



[360 x (Y2 - Y1)]  [30 x (M2 - M1)]  (D2 - D1)

360


Y1 is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest Period falls;

Y2 is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day
of the Interest Period falls;

M1 is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest Period
falls;

M2 is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following
the last day of the Interest Period falls;

D1 is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless such
number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and

D2 is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last day included
in the Interest Period, unless such number would be 31, in which case D2 will be 30;

(vii) if "30E/360 (ISDA)" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the number of days in the
Interest Period divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows:


Day Count Fraction =

where:



[360 x (Y2 - Y1)]  [30 x (M2 - M1)]  (D2 - D1)

360


Y1 is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest Period falls;

Y2 is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following the last day
of the Interest Period falls;

M1 is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest Period
falls;

M2 is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following
the last day of the Interest Period falls;

D1 is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless (i) that day
is the last day of February or (ii) such number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and

D2 is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last day included
in the Interest Period, unless (i) that day is the last day of February but not the Maturity Date
or (ii) such number would be 31, in which case D2 will be 30.

**(e)** **Linear Interpolation**

Where Linear Interpolation is specified as applicable in respect of an Interest Period in the
applicable Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be calculated by the Agent
by straight line linear interpolation by reference to two rates based on the relevant Reference Rate
(where Screen Rate Determination is specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms) or the
relevant Floating Rate Option (where ISDA Determination is specified as applicable in the
applicable Final Terms), one of which shall be determined as if the Designated Maturity were the
period of time for which rates are available next shorter than the length of the relevant Interest
Period and the other of which shall be determined as if the Designated Maturity were the period of


-----

time for which rates are available next longer than the length of the relevant Interest Period provided
however that if there is no rate available for a period of time next shorter or, as the case may be, next
longer, then the Agent shall determine such rate at such time and by reference to such sources as it
determines appropriate.

Designated Maturity means, in relation to Screen Rate Determination, the period of time designated
in the Reference Rate.

**(f)** **Notification of Rate of Interest and Interest Amounts**

The Principal Paying Agent will cause the Rate of Interest and each Interest Amount for each
Interest Period and the relevant Interest Payment Date to be notified to the relevant Issuer, the
Trustee and any stock exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being
listed in accordance with the rules of such stock exchange and notice thereof to be published in
accordance with Condition 14 as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than
the fourth TARGET Business Day thereafter. Each Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date so
notified may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of
adjustment) without prior notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period.
Any such amendment will promptly be notified to each stock exchange on which the relevant
Floating Rate Notes are for the time being listed and to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 14. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression TARGET Business Day means a
day on which the TARGET2 System is open.

**(g)** **Certificates to be final**

All certificates, communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions
given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 5.2, whether
by the Principal Paying Agent or, if applicable, the Calculation Agent, shall (in the absence of an
error which is manifest) be binding on the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued
by TI Finance), the Principal Paying Agent, the other Agents and all Noteholders and Couponholders
and (in the absence as aforesaid) no liability to the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case of
Notes issued by TI Finance), the Noteholders or the Couponholders shall attach to the Principal
Paying Agent or, if applicable, the Trustee or any agent appointed by the Trustee in connection with
the exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions pursuant to such provisions.

**5.3** **Change of Interest Basis**

If Change of Interest Basis is specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms, the interest
payable in respect of the Notes will be calculated in accordance with Condition 5.1 or Condition 5.2,
each applicable only for the relevant periods specified in the applicable Final Terms.

If Change of Interest Basis is specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms, and Issuer’s
Switch Option is also specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms, the Issuer may, on one or
more occasions, as specified in the applicable Final Terms, at its option (any such option, a Switch
**Option), having given notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14 (Notices) and**
delivering such notice to the Paying Agent and the Calculation Agent on or prior to the relevant
Switch Option Expiry Date, change the Interest Basis of the Notes from Fixed Rate to Floating Rate
or Floating Rate to Fixed Rate or as otherwise specified in the applicable Final Terms with effect
from (and including) the Switch Option Effective Date specified in the applicable Final Terms to
(but excluding) the Maturity Date (or, where more than one Switch Option Effective Date is
specified in the applicable Final Terms, up to and excluding the next following Switch Option
Effective Date), provided that (A) the Switch Option may be exercised only in respect of all the
outstanding Notes, (B) upon exercise of a Switch Option, the Interest Basis change will be effective
from (and including) the relevant Switch Option Effective Date until the Maturity Date (or, where
more than one Switch Option Effective Date is specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms,
up to and excluding the next following Switch Option Effective Date to the extent the related Switch


-----

Option is exercised), and (C) where a Switch Option has not been exercised prior to the relevant
Switch Option Expiry Date, the Issuer shall no longer be entitled to exercise such Switch Option and
the Interest Basis shall not change.

**Switch Option Expiry Date and Switch Option Effective Date shall mean any date specified as**
such in the applicable Final Terms provided that any date specified in the applicable Final Terms as
a Switch Option Effective Date shall be deemed as such subject to the exercise of the relevant
Switch Option having been notified by the Issuer pursuant to this Condition and in accordance with
Condition 14 (Notices) prior to the relevant Switch Option Expiry Date.

**5.4** **Accrual of interest**

Each Note (or in the case of the redemption of part only of a Note, that part only of such Note) will
cease to bear interest (if any) from the date for its redemption unless payment of principal is
improperly withheld or refused. In such event, interest will continue to accrue as provided in the
Trust Deed.

**6.** **PAYMENTS**

**6.1** **Method of payment**

Subject as provided below:

(a) payments in a Specified Currency other than euro will be made by credit or transfer to an
account in the relevant Specified Currency maintained by the payee with a bank in the
principal financial centre of the country of such Specified Currency (which, if the Specified
Currency is Australian dollars or New Zealand dollars, shall be Sydney and Auckland,
respectively); and

(b) payments in euro will be made by credit or transfer to a euro account (or any other account
to which euro may be credited or transferred) specified by the payee.

Payments will be subject in all cases to (i) any fiscal or other laws and regulations applicable thereto
in the place of payment, but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 8 and (ii) any
withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections
1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto.

**6.2** **Presentation of definitive Notes and Coupons**

Payments of principal in respect of definitive Notes will (subject as provided below) be made in the
manner provided in Condition 6.1 above against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part
payment of any sum due, endorsement) of definitive Notes, and payments of interest in respect of
definitive Notes will (subject as provided below) be made as aforesaid only against presentation and
surrender (or, in the case of part payment of any sum due, endorsement) of Coupons, in each case at
the specified office of any Paying Agent outside the United States (which expression, as used herein,
means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia, its territories,
its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction)).

Fixed Rate Notes in definitive form (other than Long Maturity Notes (as defined below)) should be
presented for payment together with all unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto (which expression
shall for this purpose include Coupons falling to be issued on exchange of matured Talons), failing
which the amount of any missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being made in
full, the same proportion of the amount of such missing unmatured Coupon as the sum so paid bears
to the sum due) will be deducted from the sum due for payment. Each amount of principal so


-----

deducted will be paid in the manner mentioned above against surrender of the relative missing
Coupon at any time before the expiry of 10 years after the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 8)
in respect of such principal (whether or not such Coupon would otherwise have become void under
Condition 9) or, if later, five years from the date on which such Coupon would otherwise have
become due, but in no event thereafter.

Upon any Fixed Rate Note in definitive form becoming due and repayable prior to its Maturity Date,
all unmatured Talons (if any) appertaining thereto will become void and no further Coupons will be
issued in respect thereof.

Upon the date on which any Floating Rate Note or Long Maturity Note in definitive form becomes
due and repayable, unmatured Coupons and Talons (if any) relating thereto (whether or not attached)
shall become void and no payment or, as the case may be, exchange for further Coupons shall be
made in respect thereof. A Long Maturity Note is a Fixed Rate Note (other than a Fixed Rate Note
which on issue had a Talon attached) whose nominal amount on issue is less than the aggregate
interest payable thereon provided that such Note shall cease to be a Long Maturity Note on the
Interest Payment Date on which the aggregate amount of interest remaining to be paid after that date
is less than the nominal amount of such Note.

If the due date for redemption of any definitive Note is not an Interest Payment Date, interest (if any)
accrued in respect of such Note from (and including) the preceding Interest Payment Date or, as the
case may be, the Interest Commencement Date shall be payable only against surrender of the
relevant definitive Note.

**6.3** **Payments in respect of Global Notes**

Payments of principal and interest (if any) in respect of Notes represented by any Global Note will
(subject as provided below) be made in the manner specified above in relation to definitive Notes or
otherwise in the manner specified in the relevant Global Note, where applicable against presentation
or surrender, as the case may be, of such Global Note at the specified office of any Paying Agent
outside the United States. A record of each payment made, distinguishing between any payment of
principal and any payment of interest, will be made either on such Global Note by the Paying Agent
to which it was presented or in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, as
applicable.

**6.4** **General provisions applicable to payments**

The holder of a Global Note shall be the only person entitled to receive payments in respect of Notes
represented by such Global Note and the relevant Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor (in the
case of Notes issued by TI Finance) will be discharged by payment to, or to the order of, the holder
of such Global Note in respect of each amount so paid. Each of the persons shown in the records of
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the beneficial holder of a particular nominal amount of
Notes represented by such Global Note must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg,
as the case may be, for his share of each payment so made by the relevant Issuer or, as the case may
be, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) to, or to the order of, the holder of such
Global Note.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Condition, if any amount of principal and/or
interest in respect of Notes is payable in U.S. dollars, such U.S. dollar payments of principal and/or
interest in respect of such Notes will be made at the specified office of a Paying Agent in the United
States if:

(a) the relevant Issuer has appointed Paying Agents with specified offices outside the United
States with the reasonable expectation that such Paying Agents would be able to make
payment in U.S. dollars at such specified offices outside the United States of the full amount
of principal and interest on the Notes in the manner provided above when due;


-----

(b) payment of the full amount of such principal and interest at all such specified offices outside
the United States is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar
restrictions on the full payment or receipt of principal and interest in U.S. dollars; and

(c) such payment is then permitted under United States law without involving, in the opinion of
the relevant Issuer and the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance), adverse
tax consequences to the relevant Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor (in the case of
Notes issued by TI Finance).

**6.5** **Payment Day**

If the date for payment of any amount in respect of any Note or Coupon is not a Payment Day, the
holder thereof shall not be entitled to payment until the next following Payment Day in the relevant
place and shall not be entitled to further interest or other payment in respect of such delay. For these
purposes, Payment Day means any day which (subject to Condition 9) is:

(a) a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are
open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency
deposits) in:

(i) in the case of definitive Notes only, the relevant place of presentation;

(ii) any Additional Financial Centre specified in the applicable Final Terms; and

(b) either (1) in relation to any sum payable in a Specified Currency other than euro, a day on
which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for
general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in
the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant Specified Currency (which, if the
Specified Currency is Australian dollars or New Zealand dollars, shall be Sydney and
Auckland, respectively) or (2) in relation to any sum payable in euro, a day on which the
TARGET2 System is open.

**6.6** **Interpretation of principal and interest**

Any reference in these Conditions to principal in respect of the Notes shall be deemed to include, as
applicable:

(a) any additional amounts which may be payable with respect to principal under Condition 8 or
under any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto, or in substitution therefor,
pursuant to the Trust Deed;

(b) the Final Redemption Amount of the Notes;

(c) the Early Redemption Amount of the Notes;

(d) the Optional Redemption Amount(s) (if any) of the Notes;

(e) in relation to Zero Coupon Notes, the Amortised Face Amount (as defined in Condition 7.7);
and

(f) any premium and any other amounts (other than interest) which may be payable by the
relevant Issuer under or in respect of the Notes.

Any reference in these Conditions to interest in respect of the Notes shall be deemed to include, as
applicable, any additional amounts which may be payable with respect to interest under Condition 8


-----

or under any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto, or in substitution therefor, pursuant
to the Trust Deed.

**7.** **REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE**

**7.1** **Redemption at maturity**

Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as specified below, each Note will be
redeemed at least at par by the relevant Issuer at its Final Redemption Amount specified in the
applicable Final Terms in the relevant Specified Currency on the Maturity Date specified in the
applicable Final Terms.

**7.2** **Redemption for tax reasons**

Subject to Condition 7.7, the Notes may be redeemed at the option of the relevant Issuer in whole,
but not in part, at any time (if this Note is not a Floating Rate Note) or on any Interest Payment Date
(if this Note is a Floating Rate Note), on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the
Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent and, in accordance with Condition 14, the Noteholders
(which notice shall be irrevocable), if the relevant Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately before the
giving of such notice that on the occasion of the next payment due under the Notes, the relevant
Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts as provided or referred to in Condition
8 or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor would be unable for reasons outside
its control to procure payment by the Issuer and in making payment itself would be required to pay
such additional amounts, in each case either:

(a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of a Relevant
Jurisdiction (as defined in Condition 8) or any change in the application or official
interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on
or after the date on which agreement is reached to issue the first Tranche of the Notes and
such obligation cannot be avoided by the relevant Issuer or, as the case may be, the
Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) taking reasonable measures available
to it; or

(b) where a Person into which the relevant Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor is
merged or to whom it has conveyed, transferred or leased all or substantially all of its assets
is required to pay additional amounts, unless the sole purpose of such a merger would be to
permit the relevant Issuer to redeem the Notes,

provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest
date on which the relevant Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued
by TI Finance) would be obliged to pay such additional amounts were a payment in respect of the
Notes then due.

Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Condition, the relevant Issuer
shall deliver to the Trustee to make available at its specified office to the Noteholders (i) a certificate
signed by a duly authorised representative of the relevant Issuer or, as the case may be, a duly
authorised representative of the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) stating that the
relevant Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing
that the conditions precedent to the right of the relevant Issuer so to redeem have occurred, and (ii)
an opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that the relevant Issuer
or, as the case may be, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) has or will become
obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result of such change or amendment and the Trustee
shall be entitled to accept such certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set out above, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders and the
Couponholders.


-----

Notes redeemed pursuant to this Condition 7.2 will be redeemed at their Early Redemption Amount
referred to in Condition 7.7 below together (if appropriate) with interest accrued to (but excluding)
the date of redemption.

**7.3** **Redemption at the option of the Issuer (Issuer Call)**

If Issuer Call is specified as being applicable in the applicable Final Terms, the relevant Issuer may,
having given (unless otherwise specified in the Final Terms) not less than 15 nor more than 30 days’
notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14 (which notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the date fixed for redemption), redeem all or some only of the Notes then outstanding
on any Optional Redemption Date and at the Optional Redemption Amount(s) specified in, or
determined in the manner specified in, the applicable Final Terms together, if appropriate, with
interest accrued to (but excluding) the relevant Optional Redemption Date. Any such redemption
must be of a nominal amount not less than the Minimum Redemption Amount and not more than the
Maximum Redemption Amount, in each case as may be specified in the applicable Final Terms.

The Optional Redemption Amount will either be the specified percentage of the nominal amount of
the Notes stated in the applicable Final Terms or, if Make-Whole Amount is specified in the
applicable Final Terms, will be an amount calculated by the Principal Paying Agent equal to the
higher of:

(a) 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Note to be redeemed; or

(b) as determined by the Reference Dealers (as defined below), the sum of the then current
values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any
interest accrued on the Notes to, but excluding, the Optional Redemption Date) discounted
to the Optional Redemption Date on an annual basis (based on the actual number of days
elapsed divided by 365 or (in the case of a leap year) by 366) at the Reference Dealer Rate
(as defined below) plus the Redemption Margin, plus, in each case, any interest accrued on
the Notes to, but excluding, the Optional Redemption Date.

As used in this Condition 7.3:

**Redemption Margin shall be as set out in the applicable Final Terms;**

**Reference Bond shall be as set out in the applicable Final Terms;**

**Reference Dealers shall be as set out in the applicable Final Terms; and**

**Reference Dealer Rate means with respect to the Reference Dealers and the Optional Redemption**
Date, the average of the five quotations of the mid-market annual yield to maturity of the Reference
Bond or, if the Reference Bond is no longer outstanding, a similar security in the reasonable
judgement of the Reference Dealers at 11.00 a.m. London time on the third business day in London
preceding the Optional Redemption Date quoted in writing to the Issuer by the Reference Dealers.

In the case of a partial redemption of Notes, the Notes to be redeemed (Redeemed Notes) will (i) in
the case of Redeemed Notes represented by definitive Notes, be selected individually by lot, not
more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption and (ii) in the case of Redeemed Notes
represented by a Global Note, be selected in accordance with the rules of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, Luxembourg (to be reflected in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion). In the case of Redeemed
Notes represented by definitive Notes, a list of the serial numbers of such Redeemed Notes will be
published in accordance with Condition 14 not less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption. So long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the regulated market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and/or listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange,


-----

such exchange will be informed once in each year of all Redeemed Notes and the aggregate principal
amount of Notes outstanding.

**7.4** **Redemption at the option of the Issuer (Issuer Maturity Par Call):**

If Issuer Maturity Par Call is specified as being applicable in the applicable Final Terms, the relevant
Issuer may, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice (or such other period of
notice as is specified in the applicable Final Terms) in accordance with Condition 14, the
Noteholders (which notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption),
redeem the Notes then outstanding in whole, but not in part, at any time during the period
commencing on (and including) the day that is 90 days prior to the Maturity Date to (but excluding)
the Maturity Date, at the Final Redemption Amount specified in the applicable Final Terms, together
(if appropriate) with interest accrued but unpaid to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption.

**7.5** **Redemption at the option of the Issuer (Clean-Up Call)**

If Clean-Up Call is specified as being applicable in the applicable Final Terms, in the event that 20
per cent. or less of the initial aggregate principal amount of a particular Series of Notes (including
any assimilated Notes issued pursuant to Condition 17) remains outstanding (other than as a result of
the Issuer exercising an Issuer Call pursuant to Condition 7.3 at an Optional Redemption Amount
that is higher than the Clean-Up Call Redemption Amount), the Issuer may, at its option but subject
to having given not more than sixty (60) nor less than fifteen (15) days’ notice to the Noteholders
(which notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption) in accordance
with Condition 14, redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes in that Series at their
Clean-Up Call Redemption Amount specified in the applicable Final Terms together with any
interest accrued to the date set for redemption.

**7.6** **Redemption at the option of the Noteholders (Investor Put)**

If Investor Put is specified in the applicable Final Terms, upon the holder of any Note giving to the
relevant Issuer not less than 15 nor more than 30 days’ notice in accordance with Condition 14, the
relevant Issuer will, upon the expiry of such notice, redeem, subject to, and in accordance with, the
terms specified in the applicable Final Terms, such Note on the Optional Redemption Date and at the
Optional Redemption Amount together, if appropriate, with interest accrued to (but excluding) the
Optional Redemption Date.

To exercise the right to require redemption of this Note the holder of this Note must, if this Note is
in definitive form and held outside Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, deliver, at the specified
office of any Paying Agent at any time during normal business hours of such Paying Agent falling
within the notice period, a duly completed and signed notice of exercise (which notice shall be
irrevocable) in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from any specified office of any
Paying Agent (a Put Notice) and in which the holder must specify a bank account to which payment
is to be made under this Condition and the Put Notice must be accompanied by this Note or evidence
satisfactory to the Paying Agent concerned that this Note will, following delivery of the Put Notice,
be held to its order or under its control. If this Note is represented by a Global Note or is in definitive
form and held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, to exercise the right to require
redemption of this Note the holder of this Note must, within the notice period, give notice to the
Principal Paying Agent of such exercise in accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg (which may include notice being given on his instruction by Euroclear,
Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary or common safekeeper, as the case may be for
them to the Principal Paying Agent by electronic means) in a form acceptable to Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg from time to time and, if this Note is represented by a Global Note the
terms of which require presentation for recording changes to its nominal amount, at the same time
present or procure the presentation of the relevant Global Note to the Agent for notation accordingly.
The Luxembourg Stock Exchange will be advised by the Agent of any such Note which has been
redeemed.


-----

**7.7** **Early Redemption Amounts**

For the purpose of Condition 7.2 above and Condition 10:

(a) each Note (other than a Zero Coupon Note) will be redeemed at its Early Redemption
Amount; and

(b) each Zero Coupon Note will be redeemed at an amount (the **Amortised Face Amount)**
calculated in accordance with the following formula:

Early Redemption Amount = RP × (1 + AY)[y]

where:

**RP means the Reference Price;**

**AY** means the Accrual Yield (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) expressed as a
decimal; and

**y** is the Day Count Fraction specified in the applicable Final Terms which will be
either (i) 30/360 (in which case the numerator will be equal to the number of days
(calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of 12 30-day months) from
(and including) the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes to (but excluding)
the date fixed for redemption or, as the case may be, the date upon which such Note
becomes due and repayable and the denominator will be 360) or (ii) Actual/360 (in
which case the numerator will be equal to the actual number of days from (and
including) the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes to (but excluding) the date
fixed for redemption or (as the case may be) the date upon which such Note
becomes due and repayable and the denominator will be 360) or (iii) Actual/365 (in
which case the numerator will be equal to the actual number of days from (and
including) the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes to (but excluding) the date
fixed for redemption or (as the case may be) the date upon which such Note
becomes due and repayable and the denominator will be 365).

**7.8** **Purchases**

The relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance), any Subsidiary of the
relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) any Subsidiary of the Guarantor may at
any time purchase Notes (provided that, in the case of definitive Notes, all unmatured Coupons and
Talons appertaining thereto are purchased therewith) at any price in the open market or otherwise.
Such Notes may be held, reissued, resold or, at the option of the relevant Issuer or (in the case of
Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor, surrendered to any Paying Agent for cancellation.

**7.9** **Cancellation**

All Notes which are redeemed will forthwith be cancelled (together with all unmatured Coupons and
Talons attached thereto or surrendered therewith at the time of redemption). All Notes so cancelled
and any Notes purchased and cancelled pursuant to Condition 7.8 above (together with all
unmatured Coupons and Talons cancelled therewith) shall be forwarded to the Principal Paying
Agent and cannot be reissued or resold.

**7.10** **Late payment on Zero Coupon Notes**

If the amount payable in respect of any Zero Coupon Note upon redemption of such Zero Coupon
Note pursuant to Condition 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 or 7.5 above or upon its becoming due and repayable as
provided in Condition 10 is improperly withheld or refused, the amount due and repayable in respect


-----

of such Zero Coupon Note shall be the amount calculated as provided in Condition 7.7(b) as though
the references therein to the date fixed for the redemption or the date upon which such Zero Coupon
Note becomes due and payable were replaced by references to the date which is the earlier of:

(a) the date on which all amounts due in respect of such Zero Coupon Note have been paid; and

(b) five days after the date on which the full amount of the moneys payable in respect of such
Zero Coupon Note has been received by the Principal Paying Agent or the Trustee and
notice to that effect has been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14.

**8.** **TAXATION**

All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes and Coupons by or on behalf of the
relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor will be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes or duties assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature (Taxes) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Relevant
Jurisdiction unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. In such event, the relevant
Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) will pay such
additional amounts as shall be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the
Notes or Coupons after such withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts of
principal and interest which would otherwise have been receivable in respect of the Notes or
Coupons, as the case may be, in the absence of such withholding or deduction, except that no such
additional amounts shall be payable:

(a) in respect of any Note or Coupon presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who is
liable for such Taxes in respect of such Note or Coupon by reason of his having some
connection with a Relevant Jurisdiction other than the mere holding of such Note or
Coupon; or

(b) in respect of any Note or Coupon presented for payment more than 30 days after the
Relevant Date (as defined below) except to the extent that the holder thereof would have
been entitled to an additional amount on presenting the same for payment on such thirtieth
day assuming that day to have been a Payment Day (as defined in Condition 6.5); or

(c) in respect of payments made by TIM with respect to any Note or Coupon for or on account
of _imposta sostitutiva pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of 1 April 1996_
(Decree No. 239) as amended and/or supplemented or superseded as at the date on which
agreement is reached to issue the first Tranche of the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, any withholding or deduction for or on account of _imposta_
_sostitutiva imposed following any amendment or supplement to or replacement of Decree_
No. 239 after the date on which agreement is reached to issue the first Tranche of the Notes
shall not be an exception to the payment by TIM of the relevant additional amounts payable
with respect to such Note or Coupon, to the extent that the amount of such withholding or
deduction exceeds the amount of _imposta sostitutiva payable by TIM with respect to such_
Note or Coupon pursuant to Decree No. 239 as amended and/or supplemented or superseded
at the date on which agreement is reached to issue the first Tranche of the Notes.

Furthermore, no additional amount shall be payable by TIM with respect to any Note or
Coupon for or on account of _imposta sostitutiva if the holder becomes subject to_ _imposta_
_sostitutiva after the date on which agreement is reached to issue the first Tranche of the_
Notes by reason of an amendment or supplement to or replacement of the list of countries
which provide for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, according to Article 6
of Decree No. 239, as amended and/or supplemented or superseded as at the date on which
agreement is reached to issue the first Tranche of the Notes; or


-----

(d) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment by a Luxembourg paying
agent to an individual resident in Luxembourg pursuant to the Law of 23 December 2005, as
amended; or

(e) in respect of any Note or Coupon presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder if such
withholding or deduction may be avoided by such holder producing a declaration or other
evidence of non-residence in the Relevant Jurisdiction to the relevant taxing authority or
making any other claim or filing, unless such holder is not entitled to produce such
declaration or other evidence or to make such other claim or filing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms and Conditions, any amounts to be paid
on the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding
imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code, or
otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations
thereunder or any official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement
between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof
(or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing such an
intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding or deduction, a **FATCA**
**Withholding). Neither the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay additional**
amounts on account of any FATCA Withholding.

As used herein:

(i) **Relevant Jurisdiction means (A) irrespective of the identity of the Issuer, Italy**
and/or such other taxing jurisdiction to which TIM becomes subject, or any political
subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax or (B) if the
Issuer is TI Finance, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and/or such other taxing
jurisdiction to which TI Finance becomes subject, or any political subdivision or any
authority thereof or therein having power to tax; and

(ii) the Relevant Date means the date on which such payment first becomes due, except
that, if the full amount of the moneys payable has not been duly received by the
Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent on or prior to such due date, it means the date
on which, the full amount of such moneys having been so received, notice to that
effect is duly given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 14.

**9.** **PRESCRIPTION**

The Notes and Coupons will become void unless claims in respect of principal and/or interest are
made within a period of 10 years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest)
after the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 8) therefor.

There shall not be included in any Coupon sheet issued on exchange of a Talon any Coupon the
claim for payment in respect of which would be void pursuant to this Condition or Condition 6.2 or
any Talon which would be void pursuant to Condition 6.2.

**10.** **EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND ENFORCEMENT**

**10.1** **Events of Default**

The Trustee at its discretion may, and if so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-quarter
in nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding or if so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution
shall (subject in each case to being indemnified to its satisfaction) (but only if, except in relation to
paragraph 10.1(a) below, the Trustee shall have certified in writing to the relevant Issuer and (in the
case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor that such event is, in its opinion, materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders), give notice in writing to the relevant Issuer that the


-----

Notes are, and the Notes shall thereupon immediately become, due and repayable at their Early
Redemption Amount together with accrued interest as provided in the Trust Deed if any of the
following events (each an Event of Default) shall have occurred and be continuing:

(a) _Non-payment: default is made in the payment of any principal or interest due in respect of_
the Notes or any of them and the default continues for a period of 10 days in the case of
principal and 30 days in the case of interest; or

(b) _Breach of other obligations: the relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI_
Finance) the Guarantor fails to perform or observe any of its other obligations under these
Conditions or the Trust Deed and the failure continues for the period of 60 days next
following the service by the Trustee on the relevant Issuer or (as the case may be) the
Guarantor of notice requiring the same to be remedied; or

(c) Cross-default of Issuer or Guarantor:

(i) any Capital Markets Indebtedness of the relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes
issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor in excess of €100,000,000 (or the equivalent
thereof in other currencies) has to be repaid prematurely due to a default under its
terms; or

(ii) the relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor fails
to fulfil any payment obligation exceeding €100,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof
in other currencies) under any Capital Markets Indebtedness of the relevant Issuer or
(in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor, or under any guarantee
provided for any such Capital Markets Indebtedness in excess of €100,000,000 (or
the equivalent thereof in other currencies) of others, and such failure continues for a
period of 30 days; or

(iii) any security or guarantee relating to Capital Markets Indebtedness in excess of
€100,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in other currencies) provided by the relevant
Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor is enforced by
the lenders and such enforcement is not contested in good faith by the relevant
Issuer or (as the case may be) the Guarantor or the relevant Issuer or (in the case of
Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor publicly announces their inability to meet
their financial obligations; or

(d) Insolvency:

(i) a court opens insolvency or equivalent proceedings against the relevant Issuer or (in
the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor which are not resolved within
six months, unless such proceedings are frivolous or vexatious and contested in
good faith and appropriately and do not result in court orders or the relevant Issuer
or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor applies for such
insolvency or equivalent proceedings; or

(ii) the relevant Issuer or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor
approves a resolution pursuant to which it goes into liquidation or (in the case of
Notes issued by TI Finance) it goes into liquidation or initiates or consents to
proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law (including, without
limitation, controlled management (gestion contrôlée), suspension of payments
(sursis de paiement), a moratorium or a composition) unless this is done in
connection with a merger, or other form of combination with another company and
such company assumes all obligations contracted by TI Finance or TIM, in
connection with the Notes and the Trust Deed; or


-----

(e) _Guarantee not in force: in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance, the Guarantee ceases to_
be valid or legally binding for any reason.

**10.2** **Enforcement**

The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings against the
relevant Issuer and/or (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor as it may think fit to
enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons, but it shall not be bound to
take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed, the Notes or the
Coupons unless (a) it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution or so requested in
writing by the holders of at least one-quarter in nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding and
(b) it shall have been indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction.

No Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the relevant Issuer or (in
the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor unless the Trustee, having become bound so
to proceed fails so to do within a reasonable period, and the failure shall be continuing.

**11.** **REPLACEMENT OF NOTES, COUPONS AND TALONS**

Should any Note, Coupon or Talon be lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, it may be
replaced at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent upon payment by the claimant of such
costs and expenses as may be incurred in connection therewith and on such terms as to evidence and
indemnity as the relevant Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Notes, Coupons or
Talons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

**12.** **AGENTS**

The initial Agents are set out above. If any additional Paying Agents are appointed in connection
with any Series, the names of such Paying Agents will be specified in Part B of the applicable Final
Terms.

The relevant Issuer and the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) are entitled, with
the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of any Agent and/or
appoint additional or other Agents and/or approve any change in the specified office through which
any Agent acts, provided that:

(a) there will at all times be a Principal Paying Agent; and

(b) so long as the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or admitted to listing by any other
relevant authority, there will at all times be a Paying Agent with a specified office in such
places as the rules of the relevant stock exchange require (which, if the relevant stock
exchange is the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, shall be Luxembourg); and

In addition, the relevant Issuer and the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) shall
forthwith appoint a Paying Agent having a specified office in New York City in the circumstances
described in Condition 6.4. Notice of any variation, termination, appointment or change in Paying
Agents will be given to the Noteholders promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 14.

In acting under the Agency Agreement, the Agents act solely as agents of the relevant Issuer and (in
the case of Notes issued by TI Finance) the Guarantor and, in certain circumstances specified
therein, of the Trustee and do not assume any obligation to, or relationship of agency or trust with,
any Noteholder or Couponholder. The Agency Agreement contains provisions permitting any entity
into which any Agent is merged or converted or with which it is consolidated or to which it transfers
all or substantially all of its assets to become the successor agent.


-----

**13.** **EXCHANGE OF TALONS**

On and after the Interest Payment Date on which the final Coupon comprised in any Coupon sheet
matures, the Talon (if any) forming part of such Coupon sheet may be surrendered at the specified
office of any Paying Agent in exchange for a further Coupon sheet including (if such further Coupon
sheet does not include Coupons to (and including) the final date for the payment of interest due in
respect of the Note to which it appertains) a further Talon, subject to the provisions of Condition 9.

**14.** **NOTICES**

All notices regarding the Notes will be deemed to be validly given (a) if published in a leading
English language daily newspaper of general circulation in London (it is expected that such
publication will be made in the Financial Times in London) and (b) if and for so long as the Notes
are admitted to trading on the regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and/or listed on
the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange if published on the website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange: _[www.bourse.lu or in another manner of publication in accordance with the](http://www.bourse.lu/)_
Luxembourg laws and regulations implementing Directive 2004/109/EC and, if so required, in
accordance with the rules of such exchange. The relevant Issuer shall also ensure that notices are
duly published in a manner which complies with any applicable laws and regulations and with the
rules of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are for the time being
listed or by which they have been admitted to listing including publication on the website of the
relevant stock exchange or relevant authority if required by those rules. Any such notice will be
deemed to have been given on the date of the first publication. If publication as provided above is
not practicable, a notice will be given in such other manner, and will be deemed to have been given
on such date, as the Trustee shall approve.

Until such time as any definitive Notes are issued, there may, so long as any Global Notes
representing the Notes are held in their entirety on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg, be substituted for such publication in such newspaper(s) or such websites the delivery
of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg for communication by them to
the holders of the Notes and, in addition, for so long as any Notes are listed on a stock exchange or
are admitted to trading by another relevant authority and the rules of that stock exchange or relevant
authority so require, such notice will be published on the website of the relevant stock exchange or
relevant authority and/or in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the place or places required
by those rules. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the holders of the Notes on
such day as is specified in the applicable Final Terms after the day on which the said notice was
given to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Notices to be given by any Noteholder shall be in writing and given by lodging the same, together
(in the case of any Note in definitive form) with the relative Note or Notes, with the Principal Paying
Agent. Whilst any of the Notes are represented by a Global Note, such notice may be given by any
holder of a Note to the Principal Paying Agent through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg,
as the case may be, in such manner as the Principal Paying Agent, and Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg, as the case may be, may approve for this purpose.

non-Italian resident legal entity or a non-Italian resident individual which is resident in a country
which does not allow for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy and (d) certain other
conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with. As long as the Notes are admitted to

**15.2** **Meetings in respect of Notes issued by TIM**

In respect of Notes issued by TIM, the Trust Deed contains provisions consistent with the laws,
legislation, rules and regulations of the Republic of Italy (including without limitation Legislative
Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998, as amended) for convening meetings of the Noteholders to
consider any matter affecting their interests, including any modifications of the Conditions or of any
provisions of the Trust Deed. The above provisions are subject to compliance with mandatory laws,

**15.3** **Waiver, authorisation, determination and exercise by the Trustee of discretions etc.**

The Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to any
modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the
provisions of the Notes or the Trust Deed, or determine, without any such consent as aforesaid, that
any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) shall not be treated
as such, where, in any such case, it is not, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the
interests of the Noteholders so to do or may agree, without any such consent as aforesaid, to any
modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct an error which is manifest
or, in the opinion of the Trustee, proven. Any such modification, waiver, authorisation or
determination shall be binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and, unless the Trustee
otherwise agrees, any such modification shall be notified to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 14 as soon as practicable thereafter.

In connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers, authorities and discretions
(including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or
substitution), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class (but
shall not have regard to any interests arising from circumstances particular to individual Noteholders
or Couponholders whatever their number) and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have
regard to the consequences of any such exercise for individual Noteholders or Couponholders
(whatever their number) resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or
otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory or any political
subdivision thereof and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder or
Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or any other


-----

person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequences of any such exercise upon
individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 8
and/or any undertaking or covenant given in addition to, or in substitution for, Condition 8 pursuant
to the Trust Deed.

**16.** **INDEMNIFICATION OF THE TRUSTEE AND TRUSTEE CONTRACTING WITH THE**
**ISSUER AND/OR THE GUARANTOR**

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified to its
satisfaction.

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, _inter alia, (a) to_
enter into business transactions with the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued
by TI Finance) and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries and to act as trustee for the holders of any
other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor (in the case
of Notes issued by TI Finance) and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and
enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform its duties under or in relation to any such
transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or
consequences for, the Noteholders or Couponholders and (c) to retain and not be liable to account
for any profit made or any other amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**17.** **FURTHER ISSUES**

The relevant Issuer shall be at liberty from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or the
Couponholders to create and issue further notes having terms and conditions the same as the Notes
or the same in all respects save for the amount and date of the first payment of interest thereon and
the date from which interest starts to accrue and so that the same shall be consolidated and form a
single Series with the outstanding Notes.

**18.** **CONTRACTS (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES) ACT 1999**

No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, but this does not affect any right or remedy of any person which
exists or is available apart from that Act.

**19.** **GOVERNING LAW AND SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION**

**19.1** **Governing law**

The Trust Deed, the Securities and the Coupons and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or
in connection with the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Notes and the Coupons are governed
by, and shall be construed in accordance with, English law, save, in respect of Notes issued by TIM,
for Condition 15 and the provisions of the Trust Deed concerning the meeting of Noteholders and
the appointment of the _rappresentante comune in respect of the Notes which are subject to_
compliance with Italian law. The provisions of Articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg law on
commercial companies of 10 August 1915, as amended, are excluded.

**19.2** **Submission to jurisdiction**

(a) Subject to Condition 19.2(c) below, the English courts have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
dispute arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes and/or the Coupons including
any dispute as to their existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination or the
consequences of their nullity and any dispute relating to any non-contractual obligations which may
arise out of or in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes and/or the Coupons (a **Dispute) and**


-----

accordingly each of the relevant Issuer and the Guarantor (in the case of Notes issued by TI
Finance), to any Dispute submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

(b) For the purposes of this Condition 19.2, each of the relevant Issuer and the Guarantor (in the case of
Notes issued by TI Finance) waives any objection to the English courts on the grounds that they are
an inconvenient or inappropriate forum to settle any Dispute.

(c) To the extent allowed by law, the Trustee, the Noteholders and the Couponholders may, in respect of
any Dispute or Disputes, take (i) proceedings in any other court with jurisdiction; and (ii) concurrent
proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

appoints TI Sparkle UK Limited at 6 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3DJ as its agent for service
of process in any proceedings before the English courts in relation to any Dispute, and agrees that, in
the event of TI Sparkle UK Limited being unable or unwilling for any reason so to act, it will
immediately appoint another person approved by the Trustee as its agent for service of process in
England in respect of any Dispute. The Issuer agrees that failure by a process agent to notify it of
any process will not invalidate service. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds from each issue of Notes will be applied by the relevant Issuer for its general corporate
purposes.

The legal name of the company is Telecom Italia S.p.A., named also “TIM S.p.A.”.

At the annual shareholders’ meeting that took place on 25 May 2016, shareholders approved an amendment

**Recent developments**

**Renewal of Directors**

On 22 March 2018, TIM’s Board of Directors met to consider, among other matters, the request of
shareholders Elliott International LP, Elliott Associates LP and The Liverpool Limited Partnership to
supplement the agenda for the Shareholders’ Meeting that was called for 24 April 2018.


-----

During the meeting, the Board acknowledged the resignation of the Executive Deputy Chairman (and
Chairman of the Strategy Committee) Giuseppe Recchi, effective immediately. With respect to the powers
over the Security department and those activities and assets of TIM that are of importance from a defence
and national security perspective, previously assigned to the Deputy Chairman Recchi, the Board of
Directors appointed Franco Bernabè as the Director with those responsibilities. Mr. Bernabè (already a
member of the Strategy Committee) was also appointed as Deputy Chairman, with the prerogatives set forth
in the law and TIM By-laws.

During the Board meeting, each of the following members resigned, effective 24 April 2018, prior to the
Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of TIM held on that date:

- Arnaud de Puyfontaine–Executive Chairman (member of the Strategy Committee by right),

- Camilla Antonini–Director (member of the Control and Risk Committee, independent),

- Frédéric Crépin–Director (member of the Strategy Committee and the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee),

- Félicité Herzog–Director (member of the Control and Risk Committee, independent),

- Marella Moretti–Director (member of the Control and Risk Committee, independent), and

- Hervé Philippe–Director (member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee).

TIM subsequently received a notice of resignation from Director Anna Jones (Chair of the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee, independent).

Article 9.10 of the TIM Bylaws provides that if at “any time a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors should cease to hold office, for any cause or reason, the remaining Directors shall also be
understood to have resigned and cease to hold office from the moment the Board of Directors is reconstituted
by appointment by the shareholders’ meeting”. Acknowledging that from 24 April 2018 these conditions
were met, the Board of Directors decided by a majority to call for a meeting of the Ordinary Shareholders to
be held on 4 May 2018.

The Board of Directors did not supplement the agenda for the Shareholders’ Meeting of 24 April 2018 and
on that date the Directors in question resigned and ceased to hold office.

On 27 March 2018, the Board of Statutory Auditors examined the request received from the shareholders
Elliott International LP, Elliott Associates LP and The Liverpool Limited Partnership to supplement the
agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 24 April 2018 and decided to supplement the agenda in
accordance with the terms requested.

On 4 April 2018, a supplemented agenda for the Shareholders’ Meeting called for 24 April 2018 was
published with the following two additional items:

- revocation of the directors (in the measure necessary, according to the timing of the resignations
offered and accepted during the board meeting of 22 March 2018, pursuant to Article 2385,
subsection one, of the Italian Civil Code); and

- appointment of six Directors, in the persons of Fulvio Conti, Massimo Ferrari, Paola Giannotti De
Ponti, Luigi Gubitosi, Dante Roscini and Rocco Sabelli, to replace Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine,
Hervé Philippe, Frédéric Crépin, Giuseppe Recchi, Félicité Herzog and Anna Jones, who have
ceased to hold office.

The Board of Directors of TIM met on 9 April 2018 to assess the Board of Statutory Auditors’ decision to
supplement the agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 24 April 2018 thereby granting the request


-----

made by the shareholders Elliott International LP, Elliott Associates LP and The Liverpool Limited
Partnership on 23 March 2018.

The Board of Directors decided by majority vote (and with the contrary vote from Directors Borsani,
Calvosa, Cornelli, Frigerio and Vivarelli) (i) to formally dissociate from the Board of Statutory Auditors’
decision, which it considered erroneous and particularly serious, (ii) to confirm that the request to
supplement the Agenda of the Shareholders’ Meeting of 24 April 2018 submitted by the Elliott funds was
superseded, in view of the resignations of eight Directors (all of which shall come into effect before the start
of the Shareholders’ meeting), (iii) to confirm the validity of the call notice for the TIM Shareholders’
meeting on 4 May 2018 in order to proceed with the full renewal of the Board of Directors, (iv) to take every
legal action to protect the rights and interests of all shareholders and of the Company, to set out in full the
reasons for its decisions by publishing the relevant documents (opinions and accompanying preparatory note
on the discussion, along with the documentation that will be made available by the Board of Statutory
Auditors) on its website, (v) to allow all TIM shareholders to have full knowledge of the Board of Directors’
positions so that they would have make informed decisions, and (iv) to send all the documents mentioned to
CONSOB for consideration of those matters which are within its remit.

In rejecting the arguments brought by the Board of Directors to support its deliberation, on 9 April 2018 the
Board of Statutory Auditors reiterated the legitimacy of its own determinations.

Furthermore, in execution of the decision taken by the Board of Directors on 9 April 2018, TIM appealed
before the Milan Court of Justice the decision of the Board of Statutory Auditors to supplement the agenda
of the Shareholders’ Meeting of 24 April 2018 in accordance with the request of the Elliott funds.

TIM requested from the Milan Court of Justice the application of urgency provisions by 24 April 2018 when
the Shareholders’ Meeting was scheduled.

On 24 April 2018 the Ordinary Shareholder’s Meeting of TIM was held under the chairmanship of Franco
Bernabè, recording the presence of 65.94% of TIM’s ordinary share capital and (i) confirmed the
appointment of Director Amos Genish, (ii) approved the 2017 financial statements, approved TIM’s
remuneration policy, (iii) approved the incentive plan based on financial instruments called “Long term
incentive plan 2018-2020”, (iv) did not appoint an external auditor for the period 2019-2020, and (v)
appointed a new Board of Statutory Auditors to be in office until a Shareholders’ Meeting is called to
approve the financial statements at 31 December 2020.

On 4 May 2018 the ordinary shareholders’ meeting of TIM was held under the chairmanship of Franco
Bernabè. The shareholders’ meeting recorded the presence of 67.15% of TIM’s ordinary share capital. The
meeting appointed the New Board of Directors. As at the date of the meeting, Elliot International LP, Elliot
Associates and The Liverpool Limited Partnership received more votes and, in accordance with by-laws, the
following 10 Directors were appointed:

- Fulvio Conti

- Alfredo Altavilla

- Massimo Ferrari

- Paola Giannotti De Ponti

- Luigi Gubitosi

- Paola Bonomo

- Maria Elena Cappello

- Lucia Morselli


-----

- Dante Roscini

- Rocco Sabelli.

The following 5 Directors were appointed by Vivendi:

- Amos Genish

- Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine

- Marella Moretti

- Michele Valensise

- Giuseppina Capaldo.

The newly elected Board of Directors met on 7 May 2018 and appointed Fulvio Conti as Chairman and
Amos Genish as Chief Executive Officer of TIM.

On 17 May 2018, TIM’s Board of Directors defined the governance structure, completing the process begun
on 7 May 2018, forming a new internal committee focusing on the investigation and monitoring of
interactions with related parties, and consequently the specific corporate procedure has been amended.
Directors Morselli (Chairman), Capaldo, Cappello and Roscini are members of this Committee. The
members of the other Committees are as follows:

- Strategy Committee – Directors Conti, Genish, Gubitosi, de Puyfontaine, Ferrari, Sabelli;

- Control and Risk Committee – Directors Giannotti (Chairman), Gubitosi, Ferrari, Moretti;

- Nomination and Remuneration Committee – Directors Altavilla (Chairman), Bonomo, Sabelli,
Valensise.

The Board of Directors chose not to appoint a Lead Independent Director, being the Chairman of the Board
classified as independent director. The Board of Directors has deemed that Vivendi is no longer a party
exercising direction and coordination over TIM and therefore terminated the previous direction and
coordination activity. The CEO has taken interim responsibility of the Procurement Unit & Real Estate
department.

**TIM trusts in constructive discussion on CIGS**

On 17 May 2018, TIM submitted a project for an Extraordinary Redundancy Fund (CIGS) for Company
reorganisation to the Ministry of Labour and trade unions. Since January 2018, TIM has been in discussion
with trade union organisations to identify measures to support the so-called “DigiTIM” strategic plan and in
particular to define a personnel plan in line with the announced purposes and targets. Despite numerous
attempts, no suitable joint solution has been possible. The need to safeguard the industrial objectives,
together with the economic and organisational sustainability requirements of the employment levels, makes
TIM submission inevitable. Unions and TIM are currently analysing and discussing the project with the
desirable prospect of swiftly reaching an agreement.

**AGCom notified by TIM of commencement of project to voluntarily separate the fixed access network**

On 27 March 2018, TIM notified AGCom, pursuant to Article 50 _ter of the Electronic Communications_
Code (ECC), of the voluntarily separation of its access network through the creation of a separate legal
entity (NetCo). The new company, which is 100% controlled by TIM, will have its assets (access network
infrastructure, from the exchange to customers’ homes, as well as buildings, electronic equipment and IT
systems) and the personnel necessary to provide wholesale services independently. The model is intended to


-----

guarantee full equality of treatment, thanks to a single access point; a “one-stop shop” for regulated and
unregulated wholesale services for all operators, including TIM. The project, approved by the Board of
Directors on 6 March 2018, will follow the procedures set forth in the Electronic Communications Code and
the timing defined by the Authority.

The creation of the NetCo will leave the Group scope unchanged and will occur in compliance with the
provisions of the Golden Power regulations.

On 6 June 2018, AGCom found admissible TIM’s voluntary legal separation project of its access network
and therefore, pursuant to Article 50 ter of the ECC, AGCom will start a coordinated analysis of the
different markets related to the access network to assess the effect of the intended transaction on existing
regulatory obligations. The results of the market analysis will be subject to a public consultation.

**Strategy**

**_Strategic Priorities and Objectives for the Plan_**

On 6 March 2018, TIM’s Board of Directors approved the Plan. The Plan provides for the digitalisation of
all processes to dramatically enhance the digital experience for best-in-class customer engagement and to
create an effective digital journey. Customer experience is expected to be improved by offering one single
and intuitive interface that will allow for more customised, multi-channel interaction, thanks to renewed IT
architecture. The above implies a fully digital model of relationship with the client, based on the use of Big
Data and advanced analytics to sustain the customer base and capture new growth opportunities, contributing
to the consolidation of TIM’s leadership in the Fixed and Mobile segments.

The objective over the Plan’s timespan is to significantly increase digital engagement with customers.

The customer offer, based on TIM’s network leadership (fiber, 4.5G and 5G early adoption in 2020), focuses
on greater convergence.

The Plan, focusing on digital innovation as a key element for a leadership positioning in the Gigabit Society,
is aimed at:

- creating best-in-class customer engagement through a digital and agile customer journey redesign;

- supporting leadership positioning by sustaining premium customer base and capturing new growth
opportunities in and outside the core business;

- accelerating cash flow generation to strengthen capital structure and increase shareholder return; and

- implementing a new agile organisation and performance-based and data-driven culture.

The main strategic priorities in the domestic (Italian) market are:

Consumer:

- sustain a premium customer base through convergence (data and exclusive content);

- extract more value from the customer base through the acceleration of fiber migration and new
avenues of growth; and

- transform customer engagement through Digital journeys and new simplified portfolios.

Business:

- sustain traditional revenue base through convergence, fiber and VOIP migration; and

- accelerate evolution towards an “ICT Company” to capture new growth opportunities (e.g., cloud,
ICT on SMEs).

Wholesale:

- sustain traditional revenues through fiber migration;

- step-change growth of non-regulated sales by radically improving customer engagement; and


-----

- optimise coverage to improve competitive positioning.

An important contribution to the Plan is also expected from the subsidiaries TIM Brasil, Inwit and Telecom
Italia Sparkle, for which strategic priorities include:

- **TIM Brasil: for the Brazilian market, the 2018 – 2020 Plan aims to confirm Tim Brasil’s leadership**
in Ultra-Broadband Networks and digitalise Tim Brasil customers’ experience to become the best
telecommunication provider in Brazil and consistently continue to improve the financial results in
terms of profitability and cash generation. In particular, a further boost is expected to be given to the
4G network with the deployment of the 700MHz coverage that, by the end of the Plan, is expected to
reach more than 4,200 cities. Additionally, in order to achieve the Plan’s objectives regarding the
digitalisation of the customer’s experience, Tim Brasil is planning to almost double the so-called
“KPI”’s regarding digital interactions, electronic billing and electronic payment, in order to deliver a
customised and flexible experience while opening opportunities for savings with respect to operating
expenses.

- **Inwit: strengthen leadership in the Italian tower market, leverage new mobile opportunities and lead**
network densification phase.

- **Telecom Italia Sparkle: sustain traditional business, expand commercial footprint on new**
geographies and accelerate data/VAS services.

The “DigiTIM” strategy combines careful financial discipline based on cost control and optimisation of
investments to increase cash generation and create value. The use of data analytics is expected to allow TIM
to improve investment efficiency by prioritising value-driven capital expenditure and by leveraging the
current UBB infrastructure; and increase efficiencies with respect to operating expenses.

The “DigiTIM” strategy is expected to drive end-to-end transformation across all business units, both
structurally and culturally. To support the transformation process, company organisation at TIM will be
delayered and will move from a silo-based approach to an agile one based on flexibility and speed with a
focus on results.

To ensure the fulfilment of the Plan, the newly created Transformation Office will oversee the execution of
the programme.

Moreover, on 6 March 2018, TIM’s Board of Directors granted TIM CEO Amos Genish the power to start a
formal procedure to notify AGCom of TIM’s request for a voluntary separation of its fixed access network.

As a result, on 27 March 2018, TIM notified AGCom, pursuant to Article 50 of the Electronic
Communications Code, of the voluntarily separation of its access network through the creation of a separate
legal entity (NetCo). For further details please also see the paragraph “Recent developments” under
“Description of TIM”.

There can be no assurance that these objectives will actually be achieved.

**Competition in the domestic market**

**_The market_**

During 2017, the Italian telecommunications market has returned to moderate growth after years of steady
decline, however, the competitive pressures continue to be very significant.

In addition to the core competition by other telecommunications players, which remains the primary
competitive force in the market, telecommunications operators also face competition from emerging, nontraditional players, in particular Over the Top companies (OTTs) and device producers, that operate in the
digital world and use a different set of assets and competitive strategies.


-----

Broadband and ultrabroadband development has been confirmed as the main driver of market evolution and
provides further growth opportunities for telecommunications operators with respect to the bundling of
telecommunications services with Media & Entertainment, IT and digital services.

As such, over time the business models of traditional players are changing to meet the challenges brought on
by new entrants and to exploit new opportunities. For example:

- Media & Entertainment: with the web becoming increasingly more important as a complementary
distribution platform, OTTs, telecommunications operators and consumer electronics companies are
playing an increasingly significant role;

- Information Technology: the decline of revenues from traditional streams is driving various players
towards cloud computing, with the goal of protecting the core business. Traditional
telecommunications operators are strengthening in this sector, including through reliance on
partnerships;

- Consumer Electronics: producers can develop services that can be used through the Internet,
building on handset ownership and management of user experience, breaking the relationship
between customers and telecommunication operators.

With respect to the current positioning of the telecommunications operators in converging markets, the
following is taking place with varying levels of progress:

- development of new services in the Media & Entertainment market (TV, music, gaming) and of new
digital services (smart home, digital advertising, mobile payments-digital identity);

- development of innovative IT services, particularly in cloud services.

**_Competition in Fixed-Line Telecommunications_**

The fixed-line telecommunications market continues to experience a decline in access and voice revenues,
on the one hand, and a growth of broadband and ultrabroadband revenues on the other. In recent years,
operators have concentrated mainly on enhancing penetration of broadband and ultrabroadband and
attempting to protect voice services by introducing bundled voice, broadband and services deals in a highly
competitive environment that is characterised by pricing pressures.

The evolution of competitive offering strategies has also been influenced by a convergence on an approach
based on the control of infrastructure, above all Local Loop Unbundling (LLU), but also fiber networks
development. The main fixed operators are also offering mobile services, either with an “infrastructured”
model or adopting a Mobile Virtual Operator (MVO) model.

With respect to infrastructure, Open Fiber (a company under the control of Enel S.p.A.) and Infratel (a
company owned by the _Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico) have disclosed and started to implement_
development plans for their fiber optic telecommunications networks alternatives to the TIM’s one,
concerning respectively the main Italian cities and so-called “market failure” areas.

Open Fiber has disclosed a 3.9 billion euro investment plan for the development of Fiber to the Home
(FTTH) in 271 Italian cities by 2022, reaching approximately 9.6 million households. The service is
currently available in some areas of such main cities, such as Milano, Torino and Bologna, previously
reached by Metroweb Italia S.p.A. (Metroweb), as well as Bari, Cagliari, Catania, Napoli, Padova, Perugia,
Venezia, Genova, Palermo and other cities.

Some of TIM’s competitors in the retail communications market have signed a deal to use the Open Fiber
network, wherever available, with respect to new ultrabroadband customers.


-----

With respect to “market failure” areas, so-called “white areas” of C and D clusters of the plan “Banda Ultra
_Larga” by the Italian Government, Infratel launched two tenders in 2016 and 2017 relating to the_
development of a network for ultrabroadband services for 9.3 million real estate units in more than 6,000
cities in 16 regions. In the first tender, Open Fiber won all five lots in the six regions involved (Lombardia,
Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Toscana, Abruzzo and Molise), encompassing approximately 3,000 cities and 4.6
million real estate units. In the second tender, Open Fiber won all six lots in the 10 regions involved
(Piemonte, Valle D’Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Provincia Autonoma di Trento, Marche, Umbria,
Lazio, Campania, Basilicata e Sicilia), encompassing approximately 3,700 cities and 4.7 million real estate
units. Moreover, Infratel has launched on 19 April 2018 a third tender for the remaining areas in Calabria,
Puglia and Sardegna.

Therefore, the development of the Open Fiber plan and of the coverage deriving from Infratel tenders has
brought about an important evolution with respect to competition on infrastructure, subject to the
overlapping reach of available ultrabroadband infrastructures.

1. Areas with a presence of two FTTH networks overlapping with Fiber to the Cabinet (FTTC) networks.

2. Areas with a presence of only one FTTH network overlapping with FTTC networks.

3. Areas with a presence of FTTH networks overlapping with ADSL networks.

4. Areas with a presence of FTTC networks overlapping with ADSL networks.

Competition in the Italian fixed telecommunications market is characterised by the presence of a number of
operators in addition to TIM, such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb, Vodafone and Tiscali, that have different
business models, focused on different segments of the market. In 2017, after years of contraction due to the
migration of customers from fixed-line to mobile telephony services and to alternative communications
solutions (Voice Over IP, messaging applications and social network chat) in Italy, there has been a slight
increase of fixed accesses, which as at 31 December 2017 were estimated at approximately 20.6 million
(including infrastructured OLOs and Fixed Wireless Accesses). Competition in the access market has led to a
gradual reduction in TIM’s market share.

As of 31 December 2017, it is estimated that the fixed broadband/ultrabroadband customers in Italy reached
a penetration rate on fixed accesses of approximately 80%. The spread of broadband/ultrabroadband
continues to be driven not only by the penetration of personal computers and other enabled devices (e.g.
Smart TVs), but also by the growing demand for speed and access to new IP based services that are reaching
a very wide diffusion (Media & Entertainment, IT, digital services).

**_Competition in Mobile Telecommunications_**

In the mobile market, the second and third so-called “Human SIMs” (i.e. multiple SIMs per user) continued
to decrease while the Non-Human SIMs continued to grow due to the increase of Machine To Machine
(M2M) SIMs (i.e. data transmission SIMs for connected objects). In 2017, the mobile market experienced a
slight growth in the spending on services, however, there were signs of weakness in the second half of the
year. The contraction of revenue from traditional services, such as voice and messaging has continued, while
mobile broadband has grown at a sustained rate.

The growth in the mobile broadband customer base has continued due to the development of LTE, with a
high penetration rate on mobile lines, especially as a result of the increasing spread of smartphones.
Alongside innovative services that have already gained traction and are under full-scale development, as in
the case of Mobile Apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of mobile
broadband, with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as the internet of things and mobile
payments.

In 2017, competition in the Italian mobile telecommunications market has been characterised by the
effectiveness of the merger between Wind Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. (Wind) and H3G S.p.A. (H3G) which


-----

resulted in them becoming the largest player in the market in terms of SIMs. Moreover, TIM has launched
Kena Mobile, a new virtual operator. The French operator Iliad has launched its mobile service in the Italian
market at the end of May 2018, becoming the fourth infrastructured operator in addition to TIM, Vodafone
and Wind Tre. In addition to these operators, the field also includes mobile virtual operators (MVO), of
which PosteMobile is the most important player. These operators continue to grow, to the detriment of
infrastructured operators.

**_Competition in the Brazilian Market_**

At the end of 2017, the Brazilian mobile market reached 236.5 million lines, 7.6 million lines (or 3.1%)
lower than at the end of 2016, and a penetration rate of approximately 113.0% of the population (118.0% in
2016). Consequently, the Brazil Business Unit churn rate in 2017 was 53.2% (52.4% in 2016).


-----

**REGULATION**

**1.** **THE EU REGULATORY FRAMEWORK**

TIM’s operations within the EU are subject to the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications
networks and services, which includes directives, regulations, recommendations and communications. As a
Member State of the EU, Italy is required to transpose directives issued by the EU into national legislation.
The regulations adopted by the European Commission (EC) are applicable and binding on each Member
State without the need of further national implementation. Recommendations and communications, on the
other hand, are not legally binding although they have to be taken into account by each Member State.

National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are independent bodies tasked with regulating and supervising the
telecommunications sector and compliance with the EU framework in each Member State. In Italy, this body
is “Autorità Garante per le Comunicazioni” (AGCom).

The EU Regulatory Framework is based on five Directives (“Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”,
“Authorisation”, “Universal Service and Users’ Rights” “Privacy and Data Protection”) that regulate all
forms of fixed and wireless telecommunications and data transmission. In Italy, the Directives have been
transposed into the “Codice delle comunicazioni elettroniche” (Electronic Communications Code – ECC).

A Recommendation issued by the EC on “relevant product and service markets susceptible of ex ante
regulation” (Commission’s Recommendation on relevant markets) completes this set of legal instruments
with the definition of a list of relevant markets “whose characteristics may be such as to justify the
imposition of regulatory obligations”. The Recommendation currently in effect (No. 2014/710/UE) was
published on 9 October 2014, following updates in 2003 and 2007. The number of relevant markets subject
to ex ante regulation has been reduced over time from 18 to 4, following the growth of the competition in the
whole sector (see “Market Analyses”).

In 2010, the EC adopted a Communication, the “Digital Agenda for Europe” (the DAE), setting forth longterm EU strategies for broadband. The DAE sets non-binding targets on broadband coverage and take-up to
be achieved by 2020:

- broadband coverage at 30 Mbit/s or more for 100% of EU citizens; and

- 50% of EU households having subscriptions above 100Mbps.

In September 2016, through the Gigabit Society Communication, the EC set the following (not binding)
additional targets for the year 2025:

- connectivity of 1 Gbps (upload and download) for all socio-economic entities (i.e. schools,
businesses, public administration, etc.);

- connectivity of 100 Mbps download for all European households and businesses; and

- uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and major terrestrial transport routes (as an interim
target, 5G should be commercially available in at least one major city in each EU Member State by
2020).

On 14 September 2016, the EC issued a legislative proposal for a Directive establishing the European
Electronic Communication Code (Recast) (the **EECC), which reviews and combines in one document the**
“Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”, “Authorisation” and “Universal Service and Users’ Rights”
Directives. The EECC will have to be approved according to the standard co-decision legislative procedure
by the European Parliament and the Council of EU and then transposed into national law. Institutions have
already started trilogue negotiations with the aim of reaching a political agreement on the text by June 2018.
The transposition of the EECC into the law of each Member State should occur by 2020.


-----

A new approach to access regulation is the central feature of the proposed EECC. The key elements of the
approach proposed by the EC to access regulation are:

- regulatory relief in the presence of co-investment and Very High Capacity (VHC) networks;

- lighter regulation for wholesale-only vertically separated undertaking with significant market power;

- no price control in the presence of a demonstrable retail price constraint and effective and nondiscriminatory access;

- possibility for NRAs to extend symmetric access obligations beyond the first distribution point; and

- a significantly more granular geographic approach to the analysis of broadband infrastructure
deployment, with the potential for differing remedies.

In addition, the European Parliament has proposed to introduce an obligation to align intra-EU call prices to
the domestic call prices which is still under discussion.

The EC has proposed to include in the scope of the communication EECC certain categories of over-the-top
(OTT), thereby addressing the level playing field issue between Telcos and OTTs, albeit only partially, as
the majority of the obligations are envisaged only for “number-based” interpersonal communication services
(ICS) and services based on the conveyance of signal, typically provided by Telcos. Trilogue negotiations
are leading to the extension of some end-user rules to “number independent ICS”.

With respect to spectrum, in order to stimulate investment, the EC has proposed a minimum duration of new
spectrum licences of 25 years. EU Institutions have reached an agreement on the minimum licence duration
providing for a minimum licence duration of at least 15 years with an adequate extension (on the basis of
efficiency criteria set in advance of granting rights) to ensure regulatory predictability for at least 20 years.

With respect to the Universal Service Obligation (USO), the EC has proposed to include in the scope of the
USO the provision of affordable functional internet access and voice communications services at least at a
fixed location. Member States have the flexibility to also include the availability obligation at a fixed
location in the USO, if access to functional internet and voice communications services is not ensured at the
national level by market or public bodies. The provision of directories, directory enquiry services and public
payphones (legacy services) is removed from the EU universal service obligation, although Member States
have the flexibility to retain them. The net cost of universal service would be financed with public funds,
rather than by Electronic Communication Service (ECS) providers. The European Parliament and the
Council of European Union would like to maintain flexibility for Member States to finance the net cost with
public funds or through a sharing mechanism between operators.


**_International Roaming_**

Intra-EU roaming services are regulated by the roaming Regulation No 531/2012 (the **Roaming III**
**Regulation). The Roaming III Regulation established retail and wholesale caps for voice, SMS and data**
services. The following values have applied since 1 July 2014:

**at retail level:**
Voice out (eurocents/min) ...................................................................................................... 19
Voice in (eurocents/min) ........................................................................................................ 5
SMS (eurocents/sms) .............................................................................................................. 6
DATA (eurocents/MB) ........................................................................................................... 20
**at wholesale level:**
Voice (eurocents/min) ............................................................................................................ 5
SMS (eurocents/sms) .............................................................................................................. 2
DATA (eurocents/MB) ........................................................................................................... 5


-----

The Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 (the Telecom Single Market Regulation or TSM Regulation), approved in
November 2015, provides for the abolishing of any roaming service surcharge on top of domestic service
prices subject to “fair use” limits to avoid abuses, starting from 15 June 2017 (Roam Like at Home-RLAH
regime).

For intra-EU traffic exceeding the fair use limits, operators are allowed to levy a surcharge on top of
domestic tariffs. Such a surcharge is capped at the wholesale caps. The Regulation (EU) 2017/920 reviews
the wholesale caps established in the Roaming III Regulation. The new caps are reported in the table below.

Voice ............................................................................................. 3,2 eurocents/min.
SMS ............................................................................................... 1 eurocent/min.

7,7 euro/GB from 15/06/17
6,0 euro/GB from 01/01/18
4,5 euro/GB from 01/01/19

Data ...............................................................................................

3,5 euro/GB from 01/01/20
3,0 euro/GB from 01/01/21
2,5 euro/GB from 01/01/22


**_New rules introduced by the TSM Regulation on Net Neutrality_**

The TSM Regulation introduces new rules on Net Neutrality, which have applied since April 2016. In
particular, the TSM Regulation:

- establishes the right of end-user access to distribute information and content, use and provide
applications and services and use terminal equipment of their choice and forbids internet service
providers from blocking or slowing down specific content, applications or services, except in a very
limited set of circumstances;

- allows reasonable traffic management aimed at improving the quality of the network based on
objectively different technical quality of service requirements for specific categories of traffic.
However, such traffic management must be transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate and it
must not be based on commercial considerations;

- allows operators to offer services, other than internet access services, that are optimised for specific
content, applications or services only if the network capacity is sufficient to provide them in addition
to any internet access services provided and the offering of such services is not to the detriment of
the availability or general quality of internet access services for end-users; and

- allows commercial practices such as “zero rating”[3], subject to monitoring by the National Regulatory
Authority.

The TSM Regulation also places additional transparency obligations on providers of internet access services
in addition to those already included in the Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework.

**2.** **THE ITALIAN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK**


**_The Legal Framework_**

The main legal frameworks the electronic communications sector in Italy are as follows:

3 Zero-rating (also called toll-free data or sponsored data) is the practice of mobile network operators (MNO), mobile virtual network
operators (MVNO), and Internet Service Providers (ISP) not to charge end customers for data used by specific applications or internet
services through their network, in limited or metered data plans. It allows customers to use provider-selected content sources or data
services like an app store, without worrying about bill shocks, which could otherwise occur if the same data was normally charged
according to their data plans and volume caps. This has especially become an option to market 4G networks, but has also been used in the
past for SMS or other content services.

|Voice .............................................................................................|3,2 eurocents/min.|
|---|---|
|SMS ...............................................................................................|1 eurocent/min.|
|Data ...............................................................................................|7,7 euro/GB from 15/06/17 6,0 euro/GB from 01/01/18 4,5 euro/GB from 01/01/19 3,5 euro/GB from 01/01/20 3,0 euro/GB from 01/01/21 2,5 euro/GB from 01/01/22|


**_The Italian regulatory framework_**

In July 2008, TIM proposed to AGCom various undertakings (the **Undertakings) with respect to the**
provision of wholesale services for the access to its network aimed at integrating and strengthening the nondiscrimination obligations (imposed by AGCom since 2002) amongst TIM’s own retail divisions and the
Alternative Network Operators (AltNets).

To this end, at the beginning of 2008, TIM created the new Open Access department, a separate operating
unit focusing its activities on the implementation of the Undertakings.


-----

The implementation of the Undertakings, their complexity and their impact on the stakeholders’ IT systems
and procedures, also required the establishment of a new governance model. Specifically, the following
bodies were established: an independent supervisory body (the **Supervisory Board); the AGCom**
Undertakings’ Monitoring Group, in charge of the undertaking implementation monitoring (Gruppo per il
Monitoraggio degli Impegni GMI), the Italian Office of Telecommunications Adjudicator (OTA Italia), in
charge to prevent and settle any possible disputes amongst AltNets; and the Next Generation Network
Committee, in charge of submitting possible solutions for any technical, organisational and economic issues
which would raise due to the transition to the Next Generation Network.

On 5 November 2015, TIM’s Board approved a plan to introduce a New Equivalence Model (NEM), aimed
at further strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery (provision) and assurance
(maintenance) processes of TIM’s wholesale access services.

The NEM aims to put TIM’s sales divisions on equal footing with AltNets, in order to achieve a more
effective internal and external equality of treatment and greater transparency in the management of the line
activation requests.

Specifically, the NEM, through the reorganisation of both assurance and delivery processes, aims to improve
end-to-end performance and to remove any possible internal-external process asymmetries between TIM
Retail and AltNets (such as differences in internal and external reasons for “refusal” of delivery orders,
provision times, customer data bases and order workflows) that could produce potential discrimination.

The most important change resulting from the New Equivalence Model is that TIM Retail purchases
wholesale access services through the same interface used by the AltNets. TIM Retail and AltNets will use
the same processes, IT systems, and information databases. A full equality of treatment of the delivery
activities is therefore ensured. In particular, the same regulated wholesale access services are provided to all
Operators (TIM Retail and AltNets), at the same level of quality, prices, and with the same times.

As an initial step in the process of implementing the NEM, Open Access and TIM’s National Wholesale
department have been merged into a single department.

The plan of New Equivalence Model was communicated to AGCom within the proceeding of fixed
wholesale access services market analysis (Decision 623/15/CONS—see below) and, after a public
consultation between June and July 2016, it was approved by the Italian NRA (Decision 652/16/CONS of
December 2016).

The implementation of the NEM was completed on in May 2017. TIM retail has begun using the new
delivery systems. The migration process of the alternative operators to the new delivery systems remains
ongoing.

In April 2018, with Decision 133/18/CONS, AGCom ordered TIM to quickly solve some issues detected in
the new delivery systems.

**3.** **MARKET ANALYSES**

The EU regulatory framework (Art. 16 of the Framework Directive) obliges National Regulatory Authorities
to carry out market analyses before imposing obligations on individual operators having a Significant Market
Power (SMP) according to the specific EU guidelines.

According to art. 14.2 of the Directive “an undertaking is deemed to have SMP when, either individually or
_jointly_ _with others, it enjoys a position equivalent to dominance, which is a position of economic strength_
_providing the company itself with the power to behave, to an appreciable extent, independently of_
_competitors, customers and ultimately consumers”. Market shares are normally used as a proxy for market_
power: while undertakings with market shares of no more than 25% are not likely to enjoy a (single)
dominant position, single dominance concerns normally arise in the case of undertakings with market shares


-----

of over 40%. Market shares in excess of 50% are in themselves, except in exceptional circumstances,
evidence of the existence of a dominant position.

The basis of the market analyses is the Recommendation on “relevant markets susceptible of ex ante
regulation” which identifies the “relevant markets”. The first version of the Recommendation was adopted in
2003 and contained a list of 18 relevant markets. In 2007 the EC adopted the second version and reduced the
number of markets to 7 (both retail and wholesale markets): retail access at a fixed location (market 1) and,
at wholesale level, call origination at a fixed location (market 2); call termination at a fixed location (market
3); wholesale (physical) network infrastructure access (including shared or fully unbundled access) at a fixed
location (market 4); wholesale broadband access (market 5); wholesale terminating segments of leased lines
(market 6) and voice call termination on mobile networks (market 7).

In October 2014, the EC adopted the third version which is currently in force and identifies only five
wholesale markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation: call termination at fixed location (market 1), call
termination on mobile networks (market 2), local access at fixed location (market 3a), central access at fixed
location for mass-market products (market 3b), high-quality access at fixed location (market 4).

The market analyses carried out by the NRAs are subject to the assessment of the EC which, to a certain
extent, can challenge the NRAs’ findings, having a “veto power” on the definition of the market and on the
identification of SMP operators. Vice-versa, the EC has no veto power on the imposition of the remedies but
can raise serious doubts following which the BEREC is requested to give an opinion. The EC, the BEREC
and the NRA must then cooperate to find a solution within three months. Neither the EC nor BEREC are
able to make a binding intervention. The NRA can decide not to amend or withdraw its Decision on the
remedies but it must provide a “reasoned justification”.

Following a first round (2006-2007) and a second round (2007-2010) of market analyses, a third round was
started by AGCom in 2012. The third round of market analysis ended in October 2016 with the AGCom
Decision on fixed voice interconnection market.

With respect to retail markets, despite the fact that they are not included in the current list of the EU relevant
markets (Recommendation of 2014), the final AGCom Decision of the market analysis on wholesale access
markets, retained some obligations, such as the notification of retail charges prior to the commercial launch
and the obligation to carry a replicability test of the retail offers (taking into account the most efficient
network architecture that could be used by AltNets to compete in a specific context).

A description of the Italian wholesale market analyses is summarised below together with the main recent
developments regarding the electronic communications markets.

**4.** **WHOLESALE MARKETS**


**_Wholesale fixed access markets_**

In December 2015 (Decision No. 623/15/CONS), AGCom defined the rules for the access to TIM’s copper
and fiber fixed networks for the years 2015-17.

The main regulatory measures are the following:

- confirmation of the national scope of remedies imposed on TIM, despite the increasing development
of the infrastructure competition in some of the geographic areas;

- substantial upholding of Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) prices together with a reduction of Sub
Loop Unbundling (SLU) and Virtual Unbundling Local Access (VULA prices);

- disaggregation of ancillary service provision for provision and maintenance (i.e. delivery and
assurance) for LLU and SLU lines;


-----

- introduction of new equivalence measures, according to the NEM;

- stricter constraints on the quality of wholesale services (SLAs and penalties);

- commitment to define switch-off rules in case of decommissioning of TIM local exchanges of the
copper access network:

`o` 5 years for the switch-off of local exchanges where LLU is available;

`o` 3 years for local exchanges where LLU is not available, or for local exchanges where LLU
is available as long as TIM provides competitors with a service that is technically equivalent
to copper LLU for at least 2 years after the switch-off.

The following table shows the 2017 wholesale economic prices:

**Service** **2017**

LLU (euro/month/line) ................................................................................................... 8.61
SLU (euro/month/line).................................................................................................... 5.3
SA (euro/month/line) ...................................................................................................... 0.73
WLR POTS (euro/month/line)........................................................................................ 11.06
WLR ISDN (euro/month/line) ....................................................................................... 13.67
Bitstream shared (euro/month/line) ............................................................................... 4.29
Bitstream naked (euro/month/line) ................................................................................ 12.46
VULA FTTC shared (30 Mbps) (euro/month/line) ....................................................... 7.88
VULA FTTC shared (50 Mbps) (euro/month/line) ....................................................... 9.63
VULA FTTC naked (30 Mbps) (euro/month/line) ........................................................ 13.27
VULA FTTC naked (50 Mbps) (euro/month/line) ........................................................ 15.02
VULA FTTH (100 Mbits/10 Mbits) (euro/month/line) ............................................... 22.12
VULA FTTH (40 Mbits/40 Mbits) (euro/month/line) ................................................. 30.65
VULA FTTH (100 Mbits/100 Mbits) (euro/month/line) ............................................. 77.77

**NGA[4] wholesale physical access Monthly fees (euro)** **2017**
Miniduct access—new infrastructures—(IRU 15 years
_euro/miniduct/meter)............................................................................._ 9.11
Miniduct access—existing infrastructures—(IRU 15 years
_euro/miniduct/meter)............................................................................._ 6.21
Entries to buildings (IRU 15 years euro/miniduct) ................................... 377.19
Dark fiber—primary section (IRU 15 years/fiber) ............................... 3,119.20
Dark fiber—secondary section (IRU 15 years/fiber) ................................ 1,690.13
End to End service (euro/month/line) ................................................... 54.39
Fiber terminating segment (euro/month/line) ...................................... 5.60

The access service fees are cost-oriented according to BU-LRIC+/CCA (Bottom-Up—Long Run
Incremental Cost Plus/Current Cost Accounting) methodology and Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC) has been reduced from 9.36% to 8.77%. Moreover, New Generation Access (NGA) Risk premium
has been set equal to 3.2% for FTTH and 1.2% for FTTC.

Within the framework of the rules to access the fixed copper and fiber networks for the years 2015-17,
AGCom also defined new measures to strengthen the equality of treatment guarantees in the provision of
regulated wholesale access services at a fixed location. AGCom asked TIM to present a proposal to improve
the efficiency of its own equivalence model in the provision of wholesale services to competitors and to its
own commercial divisions. Consequently, in February 2016, the New Equivalence Model, in accordance
with the TIM Board Decision taken on 5 November 2015, was communicated to AGCom. With Decision
652/16/CONS (December 2016), AGCom approved both TIM’s New Equivalence Model and some

4 New Generation Access.


-----

“voluntary” undertakings adopted by TIM to favour the suspension of two sanctioning proceedings started
by AGCom as a result of alleged inefficiencies in the wholesale access services provision processes which
caused excessive delivery delays.

Additionally, with Decision 623/15/CONS, AGCom asked TIM to present a proposal to introduce a
disaggregation model for the delivery and assurance activities of the local loop and sub-loop unbundling
lines. TIM’s proposal (sent to AGCom in February 2016 and submitted to public consultation by AGCom in
April 2016) is based on the extension of the “System Unico” (i.e., the recourse to external companies by the
competing operators) to the above-referenced delivery and assurance activities. In August 2017, with
Decision 321/17/CONS, AGCom defined the technical and organisational conditions of the disaggregation
model. According to the approved model, alternative operators can autonomously choose whether TIM or
external companies have to carry out the above- mentioned ancillary activities for LLU and SLU services.
Moreover, the alternative operator can make direct arrangements with the external companies regarding a
series of activities, such as the contact policy, the economic conditions for the management of the
appointments, etc.

On 20 February 2017, AGCom began the fourth round of market analysis (Decision 43/17/ CONS) to review
the obligations and economic conditions of the access wholesale services. The market analysis must take into
consideration TIM’s voluntary legal separation project in relation to its access network, which was notified
to AGCom on 27 March 2018 (see the section “Recent Developments” for more details).


**_Terminating segment of leased lines_**

In July 2015, the Italian NRA approved the decision on terminating a segment of leased lines services,
essentially confirming the rules laid down at the end of the previous round of market analysis. In particular,
regarding Synchronous Digital Hierarchy / Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH / PDH) leased lines with
capacities less than or equal to 155 Mbit/s and Ethernet over SDH leased lines, TIM is subject to a network
price cap (for Access rentals CPI-6%, for Internet Protocol—“IP”—transport—8.6%) for 2015, 2016 and
2017. Regarding SDH / PDH leased lines with capacities greater than 155 Mbit/s and Ethernet over optical
fiber leased lines, as well as ancillary services, prices are to be oriented to the costs resulting from the
regulatory cost accounting.

On 13 February 2017, AGCom began the fourth cycle of market analysis (Decision 44/17/CONS) and on 16
January 2018, AGCom published the public consultation (Decision 507/17/CONS).

AGCom proposes to:

- confirm the use of the network cap for the definition of the prices of wholesale services of terminal
segments of leased lines in SDH / PDH technology and in Ethernet over SDH technology for the
years 2018-2020;

- confirm the invariance of the prices of interconnection links for the years 2018—2020, placing them
on equal footing to the prices approved for 2013 and confirmed for the years 2014-2017;

- confirm the BU-LRIC model for the evaluation of the prices of ancillary services and of the optical
fiber Ethernet circuits, including the backhauling link (fixed annually in the approval process of the
relevant reference offer); and

- remove the imposition of access obligations for new activations for the following technologies: i)
analogue terminating circuits; ii) PDH digital terminating circuits with speeds ranging from 1.2 kbps
to 19.2 kbps; iii) Ethernet terminating circuits over SDH (all speeds); and iv) Ethernet over SDH
interconnection flows (all speeds).

The market analysis must take into consideration TIM’s voluntary legal separation project in relation to its
access network, which was notified to AGCom on 27 March 2018 (see the section “Recent Developments”
for further details).


-----


**_Wholesale fixed interconnection markets_**

In October 2016, AGCom issued the final decision of the third round of analysis of fixed voice
interconnection market, specifically fixed call termination, origination and transit services (Decision No.
425/16/CONS).

AGCom decided to:

- confirm SMP designation for TIM in the origination market, although this market has been removed
from the EC Recommendation;

- set stable fixed call termination rates of 0.043 eurocents/min for TIM and alternative network
operators valid until the end of 2018, and 0.041 eurocents/min from 1 January 2019;

- exclude from the scope of price regulation the termination rates of calls originated outside the
European Economic Area (EEA), including the EU member States and Iceland, Liechtenstein and
Norway;

- remove the existing obligations imposed on TIM in the wholesale market for district-level transit;
and

- remove the obligation imposed on TIM to notify its retail call services that rely on the regulated
interconnection services 30 days before the commercialisation.


**_Wholesale mobile markets_**

In September 2015, AGCom issued a new Decision for termination on mobile networks. Compared to
AGCom’s previous market analysis, the full Mobile Virtual Network Operators (full MVNOs), i.e., BT
Italia, Lycamobile, Noverca and Poste Mobile, have SMP in addition to the mobile network operators
(MNO) and termination rates of calls originated outside EEA are explicitly excluded from the scope of price
regulation.

In addition, the WACC has been set at 10.25%, while the termination rate cap has been set at 0.98
eurocents/min for the period 2014-2017 (for full MVNOs from 30 September 2015).

On 14 February 2017, AGCom began the fifth round of analysis of the mobile market (Decision
45/17/CONS) and on 22 December 2017, AGCom published the relevant public consultation (Decision
481/17/CONS).

AGCom proposes to:

- notify twelve operators who provide or are about to provide voice call termination services on their
mobile network as having SMP;

- confirm the use of the cost model pursuant to Decision 60/11/CONS for the definition of termination
prices for the period 2018-2021, also establishing symmetrical tariffs for all notified operators;

- impose a price control obligation for the supply of interconnection kits;

- remove the cost accounting obligation imposed on TIM, Vodafone and WindTre; and

- confirm the price control obligation is limited to calls originating in the European Economic Area.


-----

**5.** **ACCOUNTING SEPARATION AND COST ACCOUNTING**

SMP operators are required to have a transparent accounting of their costs and to provide AGCom, on a
yearly basis, with a description and a report on their cost accounting system, to enable AGCom to assess
their compliance with the requirements of the electronic telecommunications regulatory framework.

Moreover, SMP fixed and mobile operators must maintain an accounting system that separates the activities
in each of the relevant wholesale and retail markets defined by AGCom according to the periodic market
analyses.

The “rules” on regulatory accounting in Italy are set in accordance with EC Recommendations, particularly
with Recommendation on “Cost Accounting and Accounting Separation”, issued in September 2005.

Changes in the regulation on cost accounting and accounting separation follow rules set out in the market
analyses.

Through Decision 623/15/CONS on fixed access market analyses for the period 2015–2017, AGCom set the
WACC for fixed networks at 8.77% (nominal pre-tax).

Through Decision 497/15/CONS on mobile termination for the period 2015–2017, AGCom set the WACC
for the mobile network at 10.25% (nominal pre-tax).

The regulatory accounting report for the year 2014 was produced in 2015 and delivered to AGCom in
January 2016.

The regulatory accounting report for the year 2015 was produced in 2016 and delivered to AGCom in
September 2016

The regulatory accounting report for the year 2016 was produced in 2017 and delivered to AGCom in
August 2017.

**6.** **RETAIL MARKETS**


**_Retail Offers_**

Despite the removal of retail fixed markets from the current list of the EU relevant markets (Commission’s
Recommendation on relevant markets of 2014), through its decision on the market analysis on wholesale
fixed access markets (Decision 623/15/CONS), AGCom confirmed that TIM is subject to the following
obligations regarding its publicly available stand-alone and bundled retail offers on fixed network: a 30-day
notification prior to the commercial launch and an assessment by AGCom of the offer “replicability” (i.e.
margin squeeze test and availability of adequate wholesale inputs); if the offer does not meet the replicability
requirement, TIM must revise the offer conditions.

The replicability of TIM’s retail offers for private tenders and public procurement bids (including either
narrowband or UBB fixed access, both stand-alone and in bundling with other services) is verified only after
the contract signature, on the basis of either AltNets complaints or AGCom autonomous initiative.
Therefore, these retail offers have to be communicated to AGCom within 30 days after the contract
signature.

In December 2016, (Decision 584/16/CONS), AGCom updated the “replicability” tests (margin squeeze
tests) methodology.

In the new guidelines, applicable from 1 April 2017, AGCom introduces the possibility to verify TIM’s
“local” retail offers, evaluating the wholesale costs as a mix of the TIM’s wholesale services actually used in
the specific area where the offer is provided.


-----

With respect to retail offers, AGCom must apply two different replicability assessment models respectively
for copper and fiber (ultrabroadband). For the fiber offers, AGCom also applies an ex-post test. If the fiber
offer does not pass such ex-post test, AGcom may open a sanctioning proceeding for infringement of the
non-discrimination obligation.


**_28-day billing cycle_**

Since 2015, operators have changed billing cycles from 30 to 28 days for mobile voice services. Since 2016,
the main operators extended this change to fixed voice services. TIM introduced 28-day billing for fixed
services in April 2017, informing the customers about the 8.6% price increase due to the new billing
schedule.

On 24 March 2017, with Decision No. 121/17/CONS, AGCom introduced a prohibition for all operators on
creating billing cycles of fewer than 30 days for the fixed line and converging services (fixed and mobile in
bundling) with an adjustment deadline by 23 June 2017. On the basis of the above Decision, in September
2017, AGCom initiated a sanctioning procedure against TIM, which concluded with a sanction of 1.16
million euros together with the obligation to return the higher amounts arising from the 28-days billing cycle
(Decision 499/17/CONS). TIM challenged this provision before TAR with a request to suspend the decision.
On 21 February 2018, the Lazio TAR suspended the enforcement of the Decision with respect to its
requirement that operators return the additional amounts invoiced since 23 June 2017 under the 28-day
billing regime. A Decision on the merits has been postponed to the next hearing, which is scheduled to be
held on 14 November 2018.

In December 2017, Law No. 172/17, which institutes the obligation of a monthly billing for all electronic
communication services with an adjustment deadline by 5 April 2018, was approved. In compliance with the
law, TIM is applying the monthly invoicing from 5 March 2018 for mobile offers and from 1 April 2018 for
fixed offers.

On 19 February 2018, AGCM started the proceeding I820 to identify possible anticompetitive agreements
between the main mobile and fixed operators to coordinate the marketing strategy in the implementation of
the obligations established by Law 172/2017. On 21 March 2018, as a precautionary measure, AGCM
ordered TIM and other operators to terminate the above-mentioned alleged anticompetitive agreement
related to the repricing of their commercial offers. On 11 April 2018 AGCM confirmed the precautionary
measure for all the operators involved. On 8 March 2018, with Decision 112/18/CONS, AGCom ordered
TIM to postpone the date of invoices issued at the moment of the restoration of the monthly invoicing for a
number of days equal to those alleged to have been illegitimately invoiced since 23 June 2017 and at the
same time withdrew the obligation to return the higher amounts arising from the 28-day billing cycle
established in the Decision 499/17/CONS. Analogous decisions have been issued against the other operators.
Following the operators’ appeals before TAR, on 9 April 2018 AGCom with Presidential Decree No.
9/18/PRES cancelled the provision of Decision 112/18/CONS which established that the postponement of
the date of invoices must occur at the moment of the restoration of the monthly invoicing and it summoned
TIM and the other operators in order to define the date after which the operators must postpone the date of
the invoices to reimburse the customers. This date has not yet been defined for TIM. On 7 May 2018, TIM
challenged AGCom Presidential Decree No. 9/18/PRES and Decision No. 187/18/CONS, which ratified
such decree.

**7.** **QUALITY OF SERVICES**


**_The measures to test the quality of the data services on fixed networks_**

AGCom Decision 244/08/CSP and its modifications, namely Decision 151/12/CONS introduced the
following obligations on quality measures:

- Internet Service Provider (ISP) measurements: the measures of the access quality of the most
common retail offers are made by an independent body, in the geographical areas of the main towns,
for each ISP; and


-----

- End-user measurements: allows a user to measure his own fixed broadband line performances with
dedicated software called “Ne.Me.Sys”. Each customer can formally certify the quality of his own
fixed-line broadband access using this software and can compare the results with the advertised
performances. These results could be used by customers to terminate the contract with the ISP
without penalties or to claim Quality of Service (QoS) parameters levels to be restored. If the results
are lower than those advertised, the user may submit a complaint to the provider which is obliged to
improve the quality within 30 days. The user may terminate the contract without penalties if a
second measure confirms the parameters.

Both measurement methods employ the same Network Measurement System, based on a software agent
running on a standard Personal Computer.


**_The measures to test the quality of the data service on mobile networks_**

AGCom Decision 154/12/CONS and its modifications, namely Decision 580/15/CONS, introduced an
obligation to carry out statistical measures by mobile network operators (TIM, Vodafone and Wind/Tre).

The measures are based on campaigns of field measurements (drive test) carried out by a third party (the Ugo
Bordoni Foundation).

The surveys concern 40 Italian cities (usually the two most populous cities in each region) and roads and
highways that connect the cities affected by the measures.

The measurement methods used include “nomadic measures” (with a stationary vehicle) in urban areas,
anywhere in the city and “dynamic measurements” (with a moving vehicle), carried out during movements
inside or between cities.

**8.** **THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE**

The Universal Service (US) is a minimum set of services of a certain quality, which must be made available
to all customers, regardless of their geographical location in Italy and must be offered at a reasonable price,
taking into account specific national conditions. To date, TIM is the only operator obliged by the Code of
Electronic Communications (art. 58) to provide the Universal Service under the Universal Service Obligation
(USO) throughout Italy. Currently the services included in the USO are the provision of access at a fixed
location and of telephone service, the directory inquiry service and the directories, the availability of public
payphones, and the provision of specific measures for disabled users.

A Fund (The Universal Service Fund), established by the Ministry of Communications, is used to finance the
net cost for the provision of Universal Service sustained by the designated operator (TIM) by means of
contributions paid by the other operators. All the main companies active in the sector, including TIM, must
contribute to this fund.

AGCom is responsible for verifying the net cost of the USO provision and to assess whether this amount
represents an unfair burden for the operator. The designated operator can receive compensation only if the
burden is determined to be unfair.

AGCom assessed the net cost and authorised the funding mechanism until the year 2005 and did not
recognise any contribution for the years 2006 and 2007.

The net cost for the provision of USO for the years 2004-2007 have been calculated on the basis of a
methodology established by AGCom in 2008 (decision 01/08/CIR) with retroactive effect, which led to a
significant decrease of the amount to be financed.

Following Judgment No. 4616/2015, released on 2 October 2015, with which the Council of State overruled
AGCom’s Decision 1/08/CIR on the application of the new methodological criteria for the calculation of the
Universal Service (USO) net cost related to the years 2004-2007, AGCom initiated proceedings for the


-----

review of the calculation with Decision 145/17/CONS for the years 2006-2007 and Decision 207/17/CONS
for the years 2004-2005. The proceedings remain ongoing.

Furthermore, with Decision 133/17/CIR, AGCom submitted to public consultation the universal service net
cost results for the years 2008-2009 with which it proposes to set the net cost value for the year 2009 to 6.7
million euros. A final decision is expected in June 2018.

With respect to past litigation, the Council of State, with a decision published on 7 July 2015, rejected the
appeal filed by TIM against the decision of the TAR on AGCom’s decisions of 2010 by which AGCom had
reviewed the proceedings for the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003. As a result, the Council of State annulled
AGCom’s Decision of 2010 establishing a possible new renewal of the proceedings for the calculation of the
contributions of the years 1999-2000 and 2001-2003.

Following the State Council decision, Vodafone requested TIM to refund the amounts paid for 1999-2000,
2002-2003 and subsequent periods. The proceeding is still pending.

With decision 456/16/CONS (October 2016), AGCom, dismissing TIM’s proposal to increase the “Voce”
offer prices (April 2016), introduced a strict procedure for future variations of the retail prices regulated
under the USO, providing, for example, a time period of at least one year between two subsequent tariff
changes and the possibility to change the prices only with reference to: (i) increase in wholesale costs; (ii)
inflation recovery; and (iii) socio-economic conditions. TIM appealed the decision before TAR Lazio which
rejected the appeal on 21 February 2018. In May 2018 TIM challenged the judgment before the Supreme
Admistrative Court (Consiglio di Stato).

Finally, with decision 46/17/CONS, starting in June 2017, AGCom introduced new measures on
concessional economic conditions to access fixed and mobile services to the benefit of specific categories of
disable customers. The provisions of the measure, applying to deaf, blind and partially sighted people,
extends the previous concessions, both in terms of concessional services (for example, flat voice and data
offers) and of the relevant disabled categories (for example, partially sighted people).


**_Public Telephony_**

In 2010, AGCom established that the criteria regarding the distribution of public payphones in Italy was no
longer consistent with the current social needs and removed any “quantitative” obligations for TIM (i.e. the
obligation to install a specified number of payphones). As a consequence, TIM is authorised to remove the
unprofitable coin-boxes after a consultation with the city councils and the interested citizens. At the end of
2017, the total number of public payphones was about 46,100.

**9.** **CONTRIBUTION FEES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF AGCOM**

TIM and the other operators are required to pay contribution fees to fund the running costs of AGCom.
These fees are calculated on the basis of each operator’s revenues and they have given rise to a series of
litigation proceedings and appeals among TIM, AGCom and other operators.

With respect to the 2016 and 2017 contribution fees, AGCom confirmed, notwithstanding the judgment of
the Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio and the following judgment of the Council of State, both issued in
2015, the methodology used in the previous years rather than applying the principle that administrative
charges imposed on the undertakings should only finance costs related to activities exclusively related to _ex_
_ante regulation and that there should be balance between these administrative costs imposed on undertakings_
and the total cost related to these activities.

On 6 February 2017, AGCom issued Decision 463/16/CONS on the payment of AGCom contribution for the
year 2017 (calculated on the 2015 financial statement data). The guidelines for the calculation of
contribution fees are unchanged from the guidelines for the calculation of the 2016 fee.


-----

In particular, on 31 March 2017, TIM paid 19.3 million euros calculated on a revenue basis, under reserve,
applying the 2017 AGCom rate of 1.4 per thousand (Decisions 463/16/CONS and 62/17/CONS).

On 15 January 2018, AGCom issued Decision 426/17/CONS on the payment of the AGCom contribution for
the year 2018 (calculated on the 2016 financial statement data). The guidelines for the calculation of the
contribution fee are unchanged from the guidelines for the calculation of the 2017 fee. For the year 2018,
AGCom decreased the rate from 1.4 per thousand to 1.35 per thousand. On the basis of this new rate, TIM
paid, under reserve, about 18.454 million euros.

**10.** **BROADBAND AND DIGITAL DIVIDE**


**_Government’s plans for UBB networks_**

In June 2016, the EU Commission authorised the Italian Government UBB State Aid Plan for a total amount
of 4 billion euros aimed at covering almost 25% of the population living in about 7,200 municipalities
belonging to the so-called UBB “white areas” (areas in which there is no NGA network available and there is
no interest of private operators to deploy it in the near future) of Italy (the **Tender). Approximately 2.9**
billion euros of this amount have been allocated. The 7,200 municipalities are grouped into two clusters, C
and D. In Cluster C, 70% of connections have to reach at least 100 Mbit/s for download and 50 Mbit/s for
upload, while the remaining 30% have to reach at least 30 Mbit/s for downloads and 15 Mbit/s for uploads.
In Cluster D, 100% of connections have to reach at least 30 Mbit/s for downloads and 15 Mbit/s for uploads.

On 3 June 2016, Infratel published a first call for tender (the **First Tender) of 1.4 billion euros for**
deploying, and managing under concession a UBB “passive” infrastructure (ducts and dark fiber) in the
white areas of 6 regions (Abruzzo, Molise, Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Toscana and Veneto) and, on 17
October 2016 the qualified operators (TIM, Open Fiber S.p.A. (OF), E.Via S.p.A. and Estra S.p.A.)
submitted their technical-economical offers.

On 8 August 2016, Infratel Italia called for a second tender on the ultrabroadband “white areas” identified in
10 other Italian regions (Piemonte, Valle d’Aosta, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Marche, Umbria, Lazio,
Campania, Basilicata and Sicilia) and in the Trento Autonomous Province, for a total value of public
financing equal to approximately 1.25 billion euros (the Second Tender). Despite TIM was pre-qualified for
this second tender also, it decided to not submit any bids in line with what it communicated to the Ministry
of Economic Development and Infratel Italia. In fact, TIM updated its investment plan at the end of 2016,
planning to roll out ultrabroadband network coverage selectively to some white areas of the Regions
included in the Infratel tender process.

On 7 March 2017, Infratel Italia awarded the company Open Fiber with all five lots of the First Tender after
technical and economic sustainability analyses (in the light of the Public Procurement Code—Decree by Law
50/2016) carried out on the OF offers made public on 24 January 2017. The publicly subsidised
infrastructure is to remain public property and to be allocated under a 20-year concession to the operator
awarded the tender lots.

On 28 July 2017, Infratel Italia awarded all the lots of the Second Tender to Open Fiber.

On 2 October 2017, Infratel began a public consultation about investment plans by private operators in the
ultrabroadband white areas of the regions of Calabria, Puglia and Sardegna, with the aim to publish, by the
first half of 2018, a third call for tender for the coverage of the residual ultrabroadband white areas not
covered by private operators plans.

In August 2017, the “Comitato interministeriale per la programmazione economica” approved the so-called
“Phase II of the UBB Plan” with an approximately 3.4 billion euro budget, of which:

- approximately 2.1 billion euros are designated for infrastructural investments in “grey areas” (areas
in which there is one NGA network available); and


-----

- approximately 1.3 billion euros are aimed to incentivise UBB demand through the concession of
vouchers to families and businesses.

On 4 April 2018, Infratel launched a consultation on the public investment plan in “grey areas”. According
to the document under consultation, the aim of the public intervention in grey areas is to support investment
projects in networks able to provide 1 Gbps symmetrical (download and upload) speed, thus achieving a
“step change” with respect to the existing networks. The consultation is a step required by the European
State aid rules ahead of the formal notification of the Plan to the European Commission. Aid measures can
only be implemented after approval by the Commission.

On 19 April 2018, Infratel called for a third tender for a total amount of 103 million euros in order to cover
the residual ultrabroadband “white areas” not covered by private operators plans, identified in Calabria,
Puglia and Sardegna after a public consultation in October 2017. On 30 May 2018 TIM sent to Infratel the
request to participate in the tender.

**11.** **PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION**

TIM must comply with Italy’s Personal Data Protection Code, which has been in force since 1 January 2004.

The Privacy Code is divided into three parts: (1) general data protection principles; (2) additional measures
applicable to organisations in certain areas, including telecommunications’ services; and (3) sanctions and
remedies.

The Privacy Code applies to all data processing within Italy and also affects organisations not based in Italy
but using equipment located in Italy, such as computer-based systems.

As of 25 May 2018, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) are fully
applicable and replaced the provisions of the Italian Privacy Code, to the extent such provisions were
incompatible with the GDPR. The GDPR applies to both companies established in the EU and to companies
that are not established in the EU but offer their services in the EU or monitor the behaviour of individuals in
the EU.

According to the Code, personal data shall be processed lawfully and fairly, retained accurately and up to
date and must not be excessive or stored for a longer period than needed. Therefore, information systems
shall be configured in order to minimise the use of personal data.

The “data subject” (any natural person that is the subject of the personal data) and the “subscriber” (any
natural or legal person who or which is party to a contract with the provider of publicly available electronic
communications services, or is the recipient of such services by means of pre-paid cards) shall receive
preliminary information on the purposes and modalities of data processing.

Prior consent of the “data subject” is needed to process personal data, except in specific cases (i.e.
obligations imposed by law or by a contract with the data subject). Furthermore, the data subject has the right
to access his/her personal data and to obtain information on the purposes and methods of the processing.

The GDPR:

- set up a one-stop shop whereby companies will only have to deal with a single national Data
Protection Authority (DPA) in cross-border data protection cases;

- establishes a new European Data Protection Board (EDPB) consisting of the heads of national DPAs
(replacing the current Article 29 Working Party) and with the power to adopt binding decisions; and

- contains fines up to a maximum of €20,000,000 or 4% of the total worldwide turnover of a company
(whichever is higher).


-----

The GDPR strengthens the protection of the individual’s right to personal data protection and requires
significant adjustments in certain aspects, introducing (among others):

- a new territorial scope, applying both to companies established in the EU and to companies that are
not established in the EU but offer their services in the EU or monitor the behaviour of individuals in
the EU;

- the principles of data protection by design and by default to address data protection issues from the
start;

- each controller and, where applicable, the controller’s representative, shall maintain a record of
processing activities under its responsibility including among the other things, the name and contact
details of the controller and the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing, a description
of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;

- stronger individual rights: the Regulation introduces new transparency requirements aimed at
strengthening rights of information, access and erasure;

- the new right to data portability, allowing citizens to ask a company or an organisation to receive
back personal data they provided to that company on the basis of consent or contract;

- stronger protection against data breaches;

- the accountability principle: more flexibility for controllers and processors processing personal data
due to unambiguous provisions on responsibility. For this purpose, a new tool is introduced in order
to help to assess the risk before one starts with the processing: the data protection impact assessment
(“PIA”) as well as increased penalties (up to 4% of the total worldwide turnover of the company) for
infringements of the regulation obligations; and

- the designation of a DPO.

TIM has put in place a specific project in order to carry out all the activities needed to ensure its compliance
with the new rules introduced by the GDPR.


**_Italy’s Privacy Provisions Related to Specific Processing Operations in the Electronic_**

**_Communications Sector_**

Italian Communication Service Providers (CSPs) must comply with strict specific obligations that apply
only to the electronic communication sector, which are provided by a specific section of the Privacy Code
that transposes the relevant EU Directives and with GDPR. As mentioned, GDPR entered into force on 25
May 2018. As such, Privacy Code provisions will apply as long as they are compatible with GDPR. Whilst
GDPR is immediately applicable, the Italian Government will pass a Legislative Decree specifying which
articles of the Italian Privacy Code will be repealed by the GDPR modifying some of the Privacy Code
provisions that need to be amended in accordance with the GDPR requirements and stating transitional
measures between the two sets of law, however as at the date of this EMTN Programme Base Prospectus, the
timeframe for such new legislation has yet to be determined.

With respect to data retention, CSPs are allowed to retain traffic data for a six-month period in order to deal
with disputes over billing and subscriber services. CSPs are also required to retain telephone and electronic
communications traffic data for the purpose of detecting and preventing crimes. The data retention terms for
crime prevention and prosecution provided by the Italian Data Protection Code are: 24 months for telephony
traffic (fixed and mobile); 12 months for electronic communications traffic; and 30 days for unsuccessful
call attempts. Article 24 of Law 20 November 2017, No. 167 provides that, by derogation of the Privacy
Code, the term of retention of such traffic data for crime prevention and prosecution related to art. 51.3quarter and art. 407.2, sub para a) of the Italian Penal Code is equal to seventy two months (from the date in
which each call is made/electronic communication traffic data is generated).


-----

Traffic data must be kept and controlled in compliance with general provisions issued by the Italian Data
Protection Authority (“Garante per la protezione dei dati personali”), which requires CSPs to adopt strict
security measures.

Moreover, customer profiling in the electronic communications sector is regulated by the Italian Data
Protection Authority. CSPs must obtain the consent of the data subject for profiling based on individual and
detailed personal data, while prior approval of the Italian Data Protection Authority is needed to process
aggregated personal data without the data subject’s consent.

Concerning direct marketing activities, the general rule is the “opt-in system”. Nevertheless, the Privacy
Code also allows the processing of personal data obtained from directories of subscribers, in order to carry
out operator-assisted telephone calls for commercial purposes. Such processing is possible in respect of any
entities (i.e. subscriber) that have not exercised their right to object by having the respective telephone
numbers entered in a public “opt-out register”, which came into force on 1 February 2011.

Finally, CSPs must adopt technical and organisational measures that are adequate in the light of the existing
risk, in order to safeguard the security of their services and to take measures when breaches of personal data
occur. Such measures must protect personal data against the risk of their accidental or unlawful destruction
or loss and of unauthorised access to the data or of processing operations that are either unlawful or
inconsistent with the purposes for which the data have been collected.

Article 33 of the GDPR states that, in case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay
and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach
to the Italian Data Protection Authority, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons. Moreover, pursuant to Article 34 of the GDPR, when the data breach
is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall
communicate the data breach to the data subject without undue delay.

Another relevant provision with regards to cookies. Article 122 of the Privacy Code which should not be
affected by the entry into force of GDPR (as the GDPR does not directly regulate cookies), sets out that
storing information, or accessing information already stored in the terminal equipment of subscriber/user (i.e.
by cookies or similar tools such as web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or others), shall only be permitted on
condition that the subscriber/user has given his prior consent after being informed by simplified
arrangements. Subscriber/users’ prior consent is not necessary to install the “technical cookies”, which are
those used exclusively with a view to “carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic
communications network, or insofar as this is strictly necessary to the provider of an information society
service that has been explicitly requested by the contracting party or user to provide the said service”.

On 8 May 2014, the Data Protection Authority adopted a general provision relating to “Simplified
Arrangements to Provide Information and Obtain Consent Regarding Cookies”, requiring that concerned
entities be compliant with the simplified arrangements, pursuant to the Article 122 of the Privacy Code, by 2
June 2015.

TIM implemented the requested measures to comply with the provision mentioned above.


**_Review of directive EU 2002/58 (ePrivacy Directive)_**

The European Commission put forward its Proposal for a Regulation on ePrivacy, which will replace the
current Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy in electronic communications and will complement the GDPR,
confirming the principle of confidentiality of communications (which is not specifically included in the
GDPR) and addressing specifically the processing of traffic and location data (metadata) generated by
providers of e-communications networks and services.

The text proposes that the principle of confidentiality be extended to new services provided by OTTs, such
as e-mail and messaging services. However, the proposed text fails to sufficiently align with the GDPR, as it
basically maintains the current rules on how e-communication services providers will be able to process


-----

traffic and location data (metadata). With very few exceptions related to the service provision, billing
purposes and security, providers will have to request consent from the end-user for processing their data.
Otherwise, metadata must be erased or made anonymous as soon as the communication has taken place if
none of the lawful grounds mentioned apply.

The proposed rules do not recognise “legitimate interest” as legal grounds or the possibility of “compatible
further processing” when the processing is not based on consent. As set by the new GDPR, such additional
processing should be allowed when compatible with the purpose for which data was initially collected and
appropriate safeguards like pseudonymisation have been taken.

National Data Protection Authorities will be responsible for the enforcement of the ePrivacy Regulation that
replicates the scheme of fines of the GDPR.

The Parliament approved amendments to the Commission proposal in October 2017, while discussions in
Council are still ongoing. Therefore, the initial goal of a swift adoption necessary to guarantee the
simultaneous application of ePrivacy regulation and GDPR in May 2018 has not been reached. The
regulation is expected to be adopted by the end of 2018.

**12.** **ANTITRUST ISSUES**


**_Antitrust in Italy_**

**Legislation on competition**

TIM is subject to Italian competition law, and namely the Law of 10 October 1990 No. 287 (the “Provisions
aiming at protecting competition and the market”) which set up the AGCM, or “Antitrust Authority”.

The Antitrust Authority is responsible for:

i applying Law No. 287 10 October 1990 and supervising: (a) restrictive agreements; (b) abuses of a
dominant position; and (c) concentrations of enterprises;

ii applying, whenever the necessary conditions are met, the relevant EU provisions (i.e., Articles 101
and 102 of the TFEU);

iii applying the Consumer Code concerning unfair commercial practices; and,

iv monitoring conflicts of interest in the case of individuals holding government positions.

In addition, the Antitrust Authority may:

v adopt interim measures; and

vi enforce commitments binding upon the proposing parties in order to dispel identified anticompetitive
concerns closing the investigation without any finding of a violation.

**Proceedings**

- **Proceeding “A428C”: on 17 July 2015, TIM received the filing from a proceeding concerning a**
possible infringement of the order contained in the A428 Decision from May 2013 with reference to
the abuse of dominant position related to the supply of wholesale services to AltNets. On 13 January
2017, the Antitrust Authority (AGCM) notified TIM of its decision, acknowledging that TIM had
fully complied with resolution A428 and that the conditions for imposing sanctions for noncompliance did not apply. AGCM also acknowledged that TIM’s conduct following the 2013
resolution has been focused on improving performance in connection with the provision of
wholesale access services that concerned the services subject to investigation and new


-----

ultrabroadband access services. AGCM also acknowledged the positive impact of the
implementation of the TIM’s New Equivalence Model (NEM), which remains ongoing. AGCM’s
decision requires TIM to: i) carry on with the implementation of NEM, which is to be completed by
30 April 2017 and ii) inform the AGCM on the levels of performance of the wholesale access
services provisioning systems and on the completion of the related project of internal re-organisation
by May 2017. At the end of May 2017, TIM filed the information required, providing evidence of
NEM implementation and data about the performance level of wholesale access services. On 9
August 2017, AGCM confirmed its positive assessment based upon the above mentioned
information.

- **Proceeding “A500B”: on 16 November 2016, AGCM notified TIM the opening of an investigation**
for alleged abusive behaviours in the market of Bulk SMS services. TIM would have hampered
competition by abusing its dominant position in the market of SMS termination on its own network.
The proceeding was initiated by a notification of the operator Ubiquity, active in the segment of the
SMS alert services for the banking and financial sectors, in competition with TIM and other mobile
operators, Vodafone included. In the complaint Ubiquity claims that TIM is applying wholesale
prices that make unprofitable the provision of the retail services for the non-vertically integrated
competitors such as Ubiquity. AGCM set 30 November 2017 as the deadline to close the procedure.
An analogous charge has been addressed to Vodafone, against which AGCM started a separate
enquiry, assuming an alleged analogous abuse of dominant position. On 12 April 2017 AGCM
decided to extend the investigation to Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of
TIM. On 28 July 2017, AGCM issued its preliminary findings (the so-called Statement of
Objections) confirming the existence of an abuse of a dominant position by TIM. On 13 December
2017, AGCM issued its final decision, imposing a fine of approximately 3.7 million euros on TIM
for having abused its dominant position in the market. On 26 February 2018, TIM appealed the
decision before the TAR Lazio. Although the appeal is still pending, on 28 March 2018, TIM paid
under reserve the above-mentioned fine.

- **Proceeding "I799": on 1 February 2017, following complaints by Wind, Vodafone and Enel,**
AGCM opened a proceeding against TIM and Fastweb to assess potential anti-competitive
agreements stemming from the creation of the joint venture Flash Fiber, aimed at deploying, in a
cooperative manner, a FTTH network in 29 cities. In order to reach a conclusion of the proceedings
without a finding of infringement, TIM decided to provide a proposal of commitments with some
amendments to the undersigned agreement. On 9 April 2018, AGCM notified TIM and Fastweb the
approval of the proposed commitments and closed the proceeding without the imposition of any fine.

- **Proceeding "A514": on 28 June 2017, AGCM opened case A514 against TIM, aimed at assessing**
likely breaches of Article 102 of TFEU, based on claims raised by Infratel, Enel, Open Fiber,
Vodafone and Wind Tre in May and June 2017. The investigation aimed at assessing whether TIM
abused its dominant position both in the wholesale access and retail services markets with respect to
the fixed broadband and ultra-broadband network.

Specifically, AGCM asserts that TIM may have acted to:

    - slow down and hinder the execution of Infratel tenders with the aim of either delaying or
making the entry to the wholesale market of another operator less profitable; and

    - adopt pre-emptive strategies to lock in customers in the retail ultra-broadband markets, by
means of commercial policies aimed at reducing the attractiveness of end-users for
competitors, thus lowering competition.

On 17 January 2018, TIM submitted to AGCM a proposal of commitments it intends to make in
order to close the proceedings with a finding of no infringement.

On 14 February 2018, AGCM extended the scope of the investigation, assuming that TIM may have
applied, in the provision of BB and UBB wholesale access services, economic conditions to hinder


-----

infrastructure competition and limit competition for customers who purchase wholesale services. As
a consequence, TIM is entitled to submit a new version of the undertakings by 5 July 2018.

The end of the proceedings is expected by 31 October 2018.

- **Proceeding "I820": on 7 February 2018, AGCM announced the start of an investigation of TIM,**
Vodafone, Fastweb, Wind-Tre and the association of operators ASSTEL to ascertain whether those
companies, together with the association, coordinated their commercial strategy, thereby breaching
art. 101 TFUE.

The above-mentioned coordination is alleged to have resulted in the adoption of almost identical
practices of implementing the obligation introduced by article 19 _quinquiesdecies of the Law by_
Decree 148/2017 (converted into Law 172/2017), which requires electronic communications
operators to implement a billing cycle of one month (or month multiples) for fixed and mobile
services.

On 21 March 2018, as a precautionary measure, AGCM ordered TIM and the other operators to
terminate the above-referenced alleged anticompetitive agreement relating to the repricing of their
commercial offers. The precautionary measure was confirmed by AGCM on 11 April 2018 for all
the operators involved.

The deadline to close the proceeding is set for 31 March 2019.


**_Antitrust issues at the European level_**

**Legislation on competition**

TIM is subject to the European competition law. European competition policy was developed from rules set
out in the TFEU and covers anticompetitive practices and abuse of dominance, mergers and state aid:

- anticompetitive practices: agreements between two or more independent market operators which
restrict competition are prohibited by Article 101 of the TFEU. This provision covers both horizontal
agreements (between actual or potential competitors operating at the same level of the supply chain)
and vertical agreements (between firms operating at different levels, i.e. agreement between a
manufacturer and its distributor). Only limited exceptions are foreseen in the general prohibition.
The most obvious example of illegal conduct infringing Article 101 is the creation of a cartel
between competitors (which may involve price-fixing and/or market sharing);

- abuse of dominance: Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits firms holding a dominant position on a
determined market to abuse that position, for example by charging unfair prices, by limiting
production, or by refusing to innovate to the prejudice of consumers;

- mergers: the EC is responsible for reviewing mergers if the annual turnover of the combined
businesses exceeds specified thresholds in terms of global and European sales. In such cases, the EC
must be notified of the transaction. Transactions falling below these thresholds may be reviewed by
the national competition authorities in the EU Member States; and

- state aids: public aid distorting competition and trade within the EU are prohibited (Art. 107 of the
TFEU). State aid is defined as an advantage in any form whatsoever conferred on a selective basis to
undertakings by national public authorities. Therefore, subsidies granted to individuals or general
measures open to all enterprises do not constitute State aid. Furthermore, the EC Treaty provides that
in some circumstances, government interventions are necessary for a well-functioning and equitable
economy, stating some exceptions and sector specific rules. The “Guidelines for the application of
State aid rules in relation to rapid development of broadband networks” establish that public funding
of broadband projects is not considered state aid if one of three exemptions are used:


-----

    - the public authority invests under the same conditions that would be applied to a private
investor (Market Economy Investor Principle—MEIP);

    - the public contribution is limited to the compensation of the provision of a service of general
economic interest (Services of General Economic Interest principle—SGEI);

    - it meets certain conditions (promoting the economic development of underdeveloped areas,
promoting the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy
a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, facilitating the development of
certain activities or areas, promoting culture and heritage conservation).

The EC is empowered by the TFEU to apply these prohibition rules and holds a number of investigative
powers to that end (e.g. inspection at business and non-business premises, written requests for information,
etc.). It may also impose fines on undertakings which infringe the EU antitrust rules. The main rules on
procedures on the implementation of the competition rules set forth in Art. 101 and 102 of the TFEU are set
out in Council Regulation (EC) 1/2003.

Since 1 May 2004 all National Competition Authorities have also been empowered to fully apply EU
Antitrust rules (i.e. Art. 101 and 102 of the TFEU) in order to ensure that competition is not distorted or
restricted. National courts may also apply these provisions in order to protect the individual rights conferred
on citizens by the Treaty. State aids rules, on the contrary, can only be applied by the EC.

As part of the overall enforcement of EU competition law, the EC has also developed and implemented a
policy on the application of EU competition law to actions for damages before national courts. It also
cooperates with national courts in order to ensure the coherent application of the EU competition rules within
the Member States.

**TELECOMMUNICATION REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN BRAZIL**

TIM Group’s operations in Brazil are subject to the 1997 General Law on Telecommunications (Lei Geral de
_Telecomunicações —_ **LGT) and to a comprehensive regulatory framework for the provision of**
telecommunications services adopted by ANATEL.

ANATEL is responsible for the regulation and implementation of national policies in matter of
telecommunications. It is a quasi-independent body (the relationship with the Ministry of Communication is
institutional, but not hierarchical) enjoying financial and operational autonomy and a wide range of functions
and powers, to ensure competition and to avoid concentration of services. The board members have a fixed
term, are selected and appointed by the President under approval by the Senate.

ANATEL has the power to impose restrictions, limitations or conditions on concessions, permits or
authorisations. ANATEL has the authority to propose and issue legally binding regulations on
telecommunications service providers. The rules issued by ANATEL are subject to periodic updates. Any
proposed regulation or action by ANATEL is subject to a period of public consultation, which may include
public hearings, and can be challenged in Brazilian courts.

ANATEL privatised the former public monopolistic operator and progressively opened the market to
competition, in addition to promoting universal access to basic telecommunications services.

With regard to the operational activity of TIM Brasil, ANATEL developed regulations for mobile
communication services (SMP—Personal Mobile Services), fixed communications services (Serviço
_Telefonico Fixo Comutado or STFC) and data transmission and multimedia services (SCM)._

In 2010 virtual mobile operators were allowed to enter the market upon commercial agreements with the
established operators.


-----

In 2016 and 2017, ANATEL issued certain regulations that are particularly relevant to TIM Brasil’s
operations, including: Resolution No. 663/2016, which modified rules of the MVNO Regulation; Resolution
No. 667/2016, which approved the General Regulation of Accessibility in Telecommunications Services of
Collective Interest; Resolution No. 668/2016, which modified the STFC Regulation; and Resolution No.
671/2016, which approved the Regulation on the Use of the Radiofrequency Spectrum and modified the
Regulation on the Collection of Public Price for the Right of Use of Radiofrequencies and the Regulation on
the Imposition of Administrative Sanctions; Resolution No 683/2017, which disciplines the obligation to
share support infrastructure for the provision of telecommunications service, including towers poles, towers,
masts, cabinets, ducts, conduits, surface structures and suspended structures.

During the year 2018, some relevant topics will be submitted to Public Consultation: (i) General Plan of
Competition; (ii) Spectrum Use Management, including Resolution on Spectrum usage limits; (iii) General
Interconnection Regulation; (iv) General Consumer Regulation; and (v) General Quality Regulation. These
new Regulations are expected to be published before the end of 2018.


**_Authorisations_**

ANATEL carried out the privatisation of the former public monopoly operator and gradually opened the
sector to competition, in addition to fostering universal access to basic telecom services. According to the
General Telecommunications Law and to the regulations issued by ANATEL, licences to provide
telecommunications services are granted either under the public regime, by means of a Concession or a
Permission, or under the private regime, by means of an Authorisation. Only certain fixed-line service
providers are currently operating under the public regime (Telefónica, Embratel and Oi, commonly referred
to as “Concessionaires”). All the other telecommunications services providers in Brazil are currently
operating under the private regime, including all the mobile and data service providers.

Since the launch of GSM mobile services in 2002, four main players operate in the mobile market (Claro,
Vivo, Oi and TIM) and compete nationwide. Third generation mobile services were introduced in 2008
while fourth generation mobile services started in 2012.

The authorisations for fixed and mobile services give the TIM Group (which operates under the brand name
TIM Brasil) coverage of the entire country of Brazil allowing it to provide fixed, mobile, long distance and
multimedia services.

According to Brazilian law, Internet access is considered a value-added service, and providers of Internet
services are not considered to be telecommunications operators.

The rules require that all telecommunications services’ operators allow network access to any interested
party to provide value-added services, without discrimination, unless technically impossible. The voice
service providers can also provide value-added service through their own networks.


**_Interconnection rules_**

Telecommunication operators must publish a public interconnection offer highlighting both economic and
technical conditions and are subject to the “General Interconnection Regulatory Framework” enforced by
ANATEL in 2005. In May 2012, ANATEL approved a new regulation which, from January 2014, requires
the application of the “bill and keep” system for local fixed termination rates, i.e., operators will take rights
of tariffs generated on their networks, and no interconnection remuneration will be owed for local calls
between two different networks.

Until 2016, the interconnection charges for fixed network (TU-RL: Tarifa de Uso da Rede Local) amount to
a percentage of retail prices for the incumbent operators. Alternative operators (including TIM) can apply
asymmetrical interconnection rates exceeding up to 20% the one applied by the incumbents. As from 2016,
the fixed interconnection rates have been following a cost oriented approach.


-----

The values of mobile termination rate (called “Value to Use the Mobile network”—VU-M) are freely
negotiated by operators. ANATEL has, however, arbitration power in case of disagreement and it can
determine a reference value according to criterion set up by regulation. From January 2013, the reference
values set by ANATEL comply with a “glide path” which led to cost orientated values starting from 2016
until 2019. On 24 February 2017, considering the glide path provided in Act No. 6,211/2014, mobile
termination call values (VU-M) were again reduced, depending on the _Plano Geral de Autorizações do_
_Serviço Móvel Pessoal (PGA-SMP) Region, to approximately 0.05 (five cents)_ _reais and, on 24 February_
2018, reduced to 0.03 (three cents) reais.

ANATEL is currently reviewing the interconnection regulation and, as a result of such process, current
practices regarding interconnection agreements may likely have to be revised.

Interconnection agreements are subject to prior approval by ANATEL.

**_General Competition Plan_**

In November 2012, ANATEL published the General Plan for Competition Targets (the PGMC), introducing
tools for market analysis and identification of operators with market power and imposition of ex-ante
obligations.

The decision opens the networks of the operators with SMP to unbundling and wholesale broadband access.
It also improves transparency measures through the creation of a Supervisory Board to ensure the respect of
the wholesale service quality levels.

Fixed networks in fiber optics are benefiting from a regulatory “holiday” of nine years, which has to be
confirmed after a public consultation to be launched in 2016 when the relevant markets, SMP operators and
the remedies applied will be revised.

In each market, ANATEL imposed a set of asymmetrical obligations to operators having SMP.

In the fixed access market an access obligation on copper networks (e.g., Leased Lines, bitstream and full
unbundling) for the vertically integrated, fixed operators having SMP (Oi, Telefónica and Telmex) was
introduced.

TIM Brasil has been identified as having SMP in the wholesale markets of mobile termination, national
roaming and access to Towers. The measures applied to a SMP operator in those markets include:

- a glide path on mobile termination rates based on a price cap system;

- an obligation to offer the service of national roaming to operators not having SMP: regional licensed
CTBC (Companhia de Telecomunicações do Brasil Central, a telecommunication company of
central Brazil that belongs to the Brazilian group Algar) and Sercomtel (a telecommunication
company that offers fixed and mobile telephony, as well as internet services, in Parana State of
Brazil) and national licensed Nextel (Brazilian subsidiary of NII Holdings, Inc. providing mobile
communications services in Brazil); and

- an obligation to present a Reference Offer of Towers, with regulated price and conditions.

The second analysis and definition of SMP operators was held in 2015 confirming the previous decision of
2012 and the remedies imposed on TIM Brasil remained unchanged.

The review of the markets susceptible to be regulated and the remedies applicable to SMP operators is
ongoing.

Public consultation was held in 2017, but the Regulation is still to be released.


-----

**Cost models’ implementation**

In 2005, ANATEL issued a ruling for “Accounting Separation and Cost Accounting”. This ruling introduced
the obligation to present the Accounting Separation and Allocation Document (Documento de Separação e
_Alocação de Contas —DSAC) for license holders and groups holding SMP in the fixed and/or mobile_
network interconnection and wholesale leased lines markets (Exploração Industrial De Linha Dedicada —
**EILD). Operators, including TIM, are providing ANATEL with the requested information since 2006 for**
fixed services and since 2008 for mobile services. In July 2014, ANATEL published the final decision
regarding the costing models to set the wholesale reference values for the fixed and mobile access and
interconnection services, as well as the reference values for the Leased Lines (Industrial Exploitation of the
Dedicated Line – EILD).

As from 2016, Fixed Termination Rates (FTRs or TU-RL) and Mobile Termination Rates (MTRs) are cost
oriented to achieve the efficient cost level based on BU-LRIC model in 2019. For EILD, the efficient cost
level will be reached in 2020.

ANATEL flagged that all products (not only call termination rates and Leased Lines) will be cost oriented
from the revision of the PGMC. In October 2016, all operators were required to answer a data request from
ANATEL, which intended to raise the necessary data to update the cost model for all the products in the
PGMC, such as national roaming and passive infrastructure.

**Mobile interconnection rate glide path**

In November 2012, TIM Brasil, along with other national mobile operators Vivo, Claro and Oi, were
identified by ANATEL as having Significant Market Power (SMP) in the wholesale mobile termination
market.

The remedies applied to SMP mobile operators included a glide path on mobile termination rate (VU-M),
based on a price cap system.

In July 2014, ANATEL published a final decision regarding the cost model and the reference values of the
mobile termination rates that will apply over the period from 2016 to 2019 for SMP operators. For 2016,
MTRS were set with a Top Down methodology, and 2017-2018 MTRs will be based on linear progressive
reductions until convergence to the BU-LRIC model is reached in 2019. The 2019 MTR (based on a full
LRIC cost model) will be 0.017 reais/min. The value for 2018 is 0.03 reais/min.

Between operators with SMP a “full billing” scheme is applied (i.e. each operator charges the total amount
of the traffic terminated on its network). Conversely, between SMP and non-SMP operators, an asymmetric
scheme applies (so-called “partial bill& keep”): each operator only pays the portion of the terminated traffic
on the other network that exceeds a threshold percentage determined by the regulator with respect of the total
traffic exchanged at the interconnection. Until February 2015, this threshold was set at 80% (i.e. a non-SMP
operator pays only if the terminated traffic on the SMP operator network is more than 80% of the total traffic
exchanged at the interconnection).

According to the previous rules, by February 2015, the “partial bill & keep” threshold between SMP and
non-SMP operators would have decreased to 60% and from February 2016 the “full billing” scheme would
have been adopted. To harmonise the evolution of the values of mobile interconnection with the introduction
of cost-oriented values, in February 2015 the regulatory authority (ANATEL) postponed to 2019 the
introduction of the “full billing” scheme in the interconnection between operators with market power and
without market power, with a progressive decrease of the mentioned threshold over the next years.

**Lower fixed to mobile call prices for incumbent operators**

Under the Brazilian regulation, MTR reductions must translate into reductions in retail fixed to mobile call
prices. Accordingly, ANATEL established new fixed to mobile retail call rates for fixed telephony
concessionaries reflecting the lower mobile termination rates applicable starting on 25 February 2016.


-----

**Allocation of the 700 MHz band**

The auction for the allocation of the 700MHz band (698-806 MHz), the provision of the fourth generation
mobile services and high speed internet was held in September 2014.

TIM Brasil, Claro and Vivo were granted three of the four auctioned national blocks of 10 + 10 MHz. TIM
Brasil offered 1,947 million _reais. The auction also ordered the winning bidders to constitute an entity_
responsible for the spectrum clean-up process. A total amount of 3.6 billion _reais is designated for the_
completion of the process and TIM shall pay 1,199 million reais.

The frequencies will be available in all Brazilian cities that could face interference in simultaneous TV and
Long Term Evolution (LTE) operations within 9 months of the complete “switch-off” of analogue television
channels.

The initial forecast contemplated 5,570 cities with a switch-off in 2018, however, Ministry Ordinance nº
3493/2016, established that:

- approximately 1,500 cities can have an immediate LTE activation since the frequencies are already
free;

- approximately 2,700 cities only need analogue channel relocation (switch-off not necessary now);
and

- approximately 1,400 cities would have a switch-off by 2018.

Bid winners were required to cover the costs for the implementation of the measures to overcome any
spectrum interference and the expenses resulting from the reallocation of digital tv channels.

In December 2014, TIM acquired the 718-728 MHz and 773-783 MHz sub-bands with national coverage;
these authorisations are valid until 2029. These sub-bands are only partially available for mobile operation
because they remain in use by broadcasters and ANATEL’s approval required for their usage is still pending.
The mobile operations on those sub-bands may only begin after the reallocation of broadcasting channels
and the following approval by ANATEL and interference mitigation.

Since 2016, the spectrum of 3,742 municipalities have already made available for mobile operation,
including the capitals of the North, Northeast and Center-West. These municipalities represent 58% of the
Brazilian population (119.4 million). The spectrum of all the other capitals are expected to be available
before September 2018. Currently about 1,000 cities are in operation.

**Spectrum auction in the 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, and 2500 MHz bands**

On 19 April 2016, ANATEL’s auction Committee assigned the multi-band local spectrum (135 MHz in the
1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, and 2500 MHz bands, including 60 MHz of unpaired Time Division Duplex
spectrum) auctioned in December 2015 for mobile and fixed-wireless broadband services.

TIM was awarded Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) spectrum in the 2500 MHz band enabling the
provision of 4G/LTE services in the metropolitan areas of Recife and Curitiba. Authorisation Terms were
signed in July 2016 for 15 years and can be renewed for an additional 15-year term.

TIM and other incumbent mobile operators (Vivo, Claro, and Oi) were not eligible to bid for any spectrum in
the 1800 MHz band because of existing spectrum caps.

**“Marco Civil de Internet”**

The “Marco Civil Internet”, which went into effect in June 2014, constitutes a kind of “Constitution” on the
use of the Internet in Brazil.


-----

Key topics covered in the new regulations include net neutrality, collection, use and storage of personal data,
confidentiality of communications, freedom of expression and the treatment of illegal, immoral or offensive
contents.

The Marco Civil has been elaborated upon by the issuance of a government decree of implementation and
enforcement. The ministry’s decree (issued on 11 May 2016) addresses three main aspects:

- clarification of the scope and implementation of the net neutrality rules;

- implementation of the rights and obligations for the protection of personal data; and

- governance of the Marco Civil, including authorities in charge of its enforcement.

The decree went into effect on 10 June 2016.

In August 2017, CADE’s General Superintendence (GS) closed with no fine following the investigation
carried out against Brazilian mobile telecommunications providers for alleged anticompetitive practices
associated with “zero rating” and sponsored data offers. In their opinion to CADE, both the Ministry of
Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications “MCTIC)”and ANATEL concluded that there was no
evidence of anticompetitive practices by the defendants. In its final decision, the GS stated that business
models on the Internet should not be prohibited ex-ante, but rather it should be monitored for potential
anticompetitive effects.

**Review of the current regulatory model for the provision of telecom services**

The Brazilian government aims to review the 1997 General Telecommunication Law and to transform the
old fixed telephony Concessions into Authorisations, modifying the relevant and related obligations.

On 11 April 2016, following a public consultation that closed on 15 January 2016, the Ministry of
Communications issued guidelines for ANATEL on how to carry out this transformation and move to a more
market-oriented licensing approach.

The Ministry recommended that public authorities should promote access to broadband service at affordable
costs and levels, putting broadband at the centre of public policies.

ANATEL is directed to:

- propose concrete rules and criteria to enable the phasing-out of concessions;

- highlight the consistency of the new licensing rules with the existing infrastructure coverage
obligations;

- ensure service provision (including broadband) in less attractive economic areas;

- give incentives to concessionaires to migrate to the new licensing framework;

- lessen the universal service obligations for fixed telephony;

- schedule the phasing-out of the retail price control over retail fixed telephony services;

- withdraw recurring licensing fees;

- schedule the phasing-out of the asset reversion scheme (foreseeing that the network assets used to
provide services under a concession must be returned to the state upon the expiry of the concession);
and


-----

- establish suitable mechanisms to ensure regulation compliance control.

As a result of the on-going debate regarding the licensing regime, ANATEL was tasked with reviewing
concession contracts by December 2016. However, after the publication of Resolution 673, approved on 30
December 2016, the deadline for reviewing these contracts was postponed to 30 June 2017, notwithstanding
revised concession contracts have been not signed yet.

Additionally, a Bill of Law (PLC—Projeto de Lei da Câmara—79/2016) is under review, which amends
Law 9.472/1997 (LGT), allowing ANATEL to change the licensing model of telecommunications service.
The concession agreement shall be replaced by an authorisation form following ANATEL’s approval.
ANATEL is responsible for attesting the criteria of “effective competition” and “proof of fulfilment of
universal service targets in the provision of Serviço Telefônico Fixo Comutado or Fixed Switched Telephony
Service (STFC).

This Bill also changes radiofrequency rules, establishing subsequent and unlimited renewals of up to 20
years and creates Spectrum Secondary Market, allowing Radiofrequency trading among players.

The Bill has been approved by the Lower House and the Senate but has not been approved at the presidential
level. On 22 December 2016, a number of senators from opposition parties filed a petition for writ of
injunction (“Mandado de Segurança”). Legislative discussion returned in February 2017 and the Bill of Law
now awaits Senate approval.

The bill awaits final approval in the Senate. Even if the Senate approves the bill without changes in
connection with the proposal approved by the House of Representatives, Presidential approval will be
required.

Additionally, a new Presidential Decree is expected in 2018 with the goal of updating and consolidating, in a
single instrument, the public policies for the telecommunications in Brazil. The proposal places broadband at
the centre of public policy of Brazilian telecommunications. This decree, submitted for public consultation in
October 2017, revokes and replaces three other decrees currently in force, bringing together in a single
instrument the regulatory guidelines for the expansion of broadband services and digital inclusion in the
country. The Decree will repeal Decree No. 4,733/2003, which provides for public telecommunications
policies; Decree No. 7,175/2010, which established the National Broadband Plan (PNBL); and Decree No.
8.776/2016, which created the Brazil Intelligent Program, a new stage of expansion of the PNBL with
actions to universalise access to the Internet and increase the average speed of fixed broadband in the
country. The decree will also establish public and private investment priorities for the expansion of
telecommunications infrastructure through fiber optics, radio and satellite.

**LITIGATION**

The most significant arbitration cases and legal or fiscal disputes in which the TIM Group is involved as of
the date of this EMTN Programme Prospectus are presented below.

As at 31 March 2018, the TIM Group has accrued provisions totalling 535 million euros for those disputes
described below where the risk of losing the case has been considered probable.

**a)** **SIGNIFICANT DISPUTES AND PENDING LEGAL ACTIONS**

**_International tax and regulatory disputes_**

As at 31 March 2018, the Brazil Business Unit is involved in tax and regulatory disputes, the outcome of
which is estimated as a possible loss amounting to approximately 15.3 billion reais (14.5 billion reais as of
31 December 2017). The main types of disputes involved are listed below, classified on the basis of the
taxation level to which they relate.

**Federal Tax**

On 22 March 2011 TIM Celular was served notice of a tax assessment issued by the Federal Tax Authorities
of Brazil for a total sum of 1,265 million reais as of the date of the notification, including fines and interest,
as a result of the completion of a tax investigation of financial years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 for the
companies TIM Nordeste Telecomunicações S.A. and TIM Nordeste S.A (previously called Maxitel),
companies which have been progressively incorporated into TIM Celular with the aim of rationalising the
corporate structure in Brazil.

The assessment notice includes various adjustments; the main claims may be summarised as follows:

- non-recognition of the fiscal effects of the merger of TIM Nordeste Telecomunicações S.A. and
Maxitel S.A.;

- non-recognition of the tax-deductibility of the write-down of goodwill relating to the purchase of
Tele Nordeste Celular Participações S.A. (TNC);

- non-recognition of certain tax offsets;

- denial of the SUDENE territorial tax benefit due to alleged irregularities in the management and
reporting of the benefit.

The adjustments included in the assessment notice were challenged by TIM Celular, in administrative
proceedings, through the presentation of its first objections on 20 April 2011. On 20 April 2012, TIM Celular
received notification of the decision of the administrative court of first instance which confirmed the findings
set out in the assessment notice; TIM Celular promptly filed an appeal against this decision on 21 May 2012.

The company, as confirmed by the relevant legal opinions, believes it is unlikely that TIM Celular could
suffer any negative consequences in relation to these matters.

At the federal level, disputes involving the following are also noted:

- challenges regarding offsetting against previous tax losses;

- further challenges regarding the tax deductibility of the amortisation of goodwill;

- imposition of income tax on certain types of exchange rate differences;


-----

- imposition of withholding taxes on certain types of payments to foreign entities (for example,
payments for international roaming);

- further challenges regarding offsets made between taxes payable and group company credit
positions.

The overall risk involved in connection with these cases that is considered possible amounts to 3.8 billion
_reais (3.7 billion reais as of 31 December 2017)._

**State Taxes**

In connection with state taxes, there are numerous disputes regarding ICMS[5], in particular:

- challenges concerning the reduction of the tax base on the basis of discounts granted to customers, as
well as challenges regarding the use of tax credits declared by group companies, with respect to the
return of loaned telephone devices, and following the detection of contract fraud to the detriment of
the companies;

- imposition of certain types of fees on ICMS, accrued in favour of group companies and classified by
them as fees for services other than telecommunications;

- challenges over the use of the "PRO-DF" tax benefit originally granted by some States, and
subsequently declared unconstitutional (the challenge refers to the actual credit due to ICMS,
declared by TIM Cellular on the basis of the aforementioned tax benefits);

- challenges relating to the use of credits for ICMS, claimed by group companies as a result of the
acquisition of tangible assets, and in relation to the supply of electricity to the companies, as well as
the application of the provisions in relation to acting as a withholding agent; and

- sanctions imposed on group companies for irregularities in tax return compliance.

In February 2018 the State of Sao Paulo notified TIM Celular of two assessments with the subject of ICMS
for a total amount of 679 million _reais (as of the date of the notification, including fines and interest), the_
first (344 million _reais) disputing the credits for ICMS on the subject of «tax substitution» related to the_
interstate purchase and distribution of devices, and the other (335 million _reais) disputing the credits for_
ICMS deriving from the "special credit" recognised by TIM Celular to pre-paid customers in anticipation of
the subsequent paid top-up.

For both claims TIM Celular’s evaluation does not frame the event of losing as likely. Only as a result of the
second assessment did TIM Celular consider it appropriate to make the payment of a minority amount (32
million reais), due to a lack of documentary evidence.

Overall, the potential risk considered possible for these cases amounts to 8.1 billion reais (7.4 billion reais as
of 31 December 2017).

**FUST and FUNTTEL**

The main complaints concerning the contributions to ANATEL, and in particular in terms of FUST and
FUNTTEL, concern the subjection of revenues from interconnection to these withdrawals.

Altogether the potential risk for such cases amounts to 2.7 billion reais, and is unchanged compared to 31
December 2017.

5 ICMS—imposto sobre circulação de mercadorias e services de tranporte intermunicipal, interestadual e de comunicação—is a type of
value added tax and is levied on supplies of goods, interstate and inter-municipal transportation services, communication services and
imports of goods. ICMS is regulated by state legislation issued by each state within the limits defined by the Constitution. The finance
departments of states (Secretarias da Fazenda) are in charge of the administration and collection of ICMS.

**_Administrative offence charge pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2011 for the so-called TIM Security_**
**_Affair._**

In December 2008 TIM received notification of the application for its committal for trial for the
administrative offence specified in Articles 21 and 25, subsections 2 and 4, of legislative decree no.
231/2001 in relation to the affairs that involved several former employees of the Security function and
former collaborators of TIM charged with among other things offences involving corruption of public
officials, with the objective of acquiring information from confidential files. In May 2010 TIM ceased being
a defendant in the criminal trial, after the Judge for the Preliminary Hearing approved the motion for
settlement of the proceedings (plea bargaining) presented by TIM. In the hearing before Section One of the
Milan Court of Assizes, TIM acted in the dual role of civil party and civilly liable party. In actual fact, it was
deemed liable as a civil party by all the defendants for all charges, and on the other it was also cited as the
party with civil liability pursuant to Article 2049 of the Italian Civil Code for the actions of the defendants in
relation to 32 civil parties. Telecom Italia Latam and Telecom Italia Audit and Compliance Services (now
incorporated into TIM) also participated in the hearing as civil parties, having made appearances since the
Preliminary Hearing and brought charges against the defendants for hacking.

After the lengthy evidentiary hearings, 22 civil parties filed claims for compensation, including against TIM
as civilly liable party, for over 60 million euros, with one party requesting over 42 million euros. TIM itself,
as civil party, also summarised its conclusions against the defendants, requesting that they be found liable for
all the damages suffered as a result of the facts of the case. In February 2013, Section 1 of the Milan Court of
Assizes issued the first instance judgment, sentencing the defendants to terms of imprisonment of between 7
years and 6 months and one year. The Court also recognised that there had been non-pecuniary damage to
some of the civil parties as a consequence of the alleged facts, and sentenced the defendants, jointly and
severally with the civilly liable party TIM, to compensate said damages, totalling 270,000 euros (in part
jointly and severally with Pirelli & C. S.p.A.) plus legal fees; at the same time the Court also sentenced the
defendants to pay compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages incurred by TIM, granting it a
provisional sum of 10 million euros. The judgment also recognised the existence of non-pecuniary damage to
the companies Telecom Italia Latam and Telecom Italia Audit & Compliance Services, sentencing the
defendants to pay compensation for damages on an equitable basis of 20,000 euros for each company. In
November 2013 the grounds for the judgment in the first instance were published (which, for its part, TIM
decided not to contest). At the end of the appeal, which was brought by the convicted defendants, the
judgment in the first instance was partly reversed. The appeal judge took note of the fact that the time limit
had expired on the majority of the charges and made an order not to proceed against the defendants who had
been convicted in the lower court, with the exception of two, who were found guilty of the offence of
revealing information which was subject to a prohibition on disclosure. As for the civil judgments, the Court
revoked those made by the judge of first instance and ruled in favour of three ministries, AGCM and the
Revenues Agency. The Court also decided to revoke the provisional sum of 10 million euros awarded to
TIM as civil party at the end of the proceedings in the court of first instance, making a generic ruling that the
defendants should pay compensatory civil damages. Finally, the judge also rejected all the demands for
compensation advanced on appeal by certain civil parties for a total of about 60 million euros, in respect of
which TIM has the role of party liable for damages. At the end of the appeal, therefore, the appeals court
upheld the prior ruling, confirming that TIM, as the party liable for damages, had already paid the parties.
The three defendants brought an appeal to the Court of Cassation against the judgment of the appeals court
issued by the Milan Appeal Court of Assizes, for which the hearing occurred in April 2018. On 26 April
2018, the Court of Cassation confirmed the criminal convictions imposed by the Milan Appeal Court of
Assizes and referred to the civil court every civil assessment. The reasons for the sentence have not yet been
filed.

**Antitrust Case A428**

At the conclusion of case A428, in May 2013, Italian Competition Authority AGCM imposed two
administrative sanctions of 88,182,000 euros and 15,612,000 euros on TIM for abuse of its dominant
position. TIM allegedly (i) hindered or delayed activation of access services requested by OLOs through
unjustified and spurious refusals; (ii) offered its access services to final customers at economic and technical
conditions that allegedly could not be matched by competitors purchasing wholesale access services from
TIM itself, only in those geographic areas of the country where disaggregated access services to the local
network are available, and hence where other operators can compete more effectively with TIM.

TIM appealed against the decision to the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) of Lazio, requesting that
payment of the fine be suspended. In particular, it alleged: infringement of its rights to defend itself in the
proceeding, the circumstance that the organisational choices challenged by AGCM and allegedly at the base
of the abuse of the OLO provisioning processes had been the subject of specific rulings made by the industry
regulator (AGCom), the circumstance that the comparative examination of the internal/external provisioning
processes had in fact shown better results for the OLOs than for the TIM retail department (hence the lack of
any form of inequality of treatment and/or opportunistic behaviour by TIM), and (regarding the second
abuse) the fact that the conduct was structurally unsuitable to reduce the margins of the OLOs.

In May 2014, the judgment of the Lazio TAR was published, rejecting TIM’s appeal and confirming the
fines imposed in the original order challenged. In September 2014 TIM appealed against this decision.

In May 2015, with the judgment No. 2497/15, the Council of State found the decision of the court of first
instance did not present the deficiencies alleged by TIM and confirmed the AGCM ruling. TIM had already
proceeded to pay the fines and the accrued interest.

In a decision notified in July 2015, AGCM started proceedings for non-compliance against TIM, to ascertain
if TIM had respected the notice to comply requiring it to refrain from undertaking behaviours analogous to
those that were the object of the breach ascertained with the concluding decision in case A428 dated May
2013.

On 13 January 2017 TIM was notified of the conclusive assessment of the Italian Competition Authority
(AGCM), acknowledging that TIM has fully complied with the judgment in proceedings A428 and that
therefore the conditions did not exist for the imposition of any sanctions for non-compliance.

AGCM also recognised that TIM’s behaviour subsequent to the 2013 proceedings had been focused on
continuous improvement of its performance in the supply of wholesale access services concerning not only
the services which were the subject of the investigation, but also new, super-fast broadband access services.
In assessing compliance, AGCM recognised the positive impact of the ongoing implementation of TIM’s
New Equivalence Model (NEM). The AGCM decision orders TIM to: (i) proceed with the implementation
of the NME until its completion which is expected to be by 30 April 2017; (ii) to inform the Authority about
the performance levels of the systems for providing wholesale access services and about the completion of
the corresponding internal reorganisation plan by the end of May 2017. TIM quickly complied with both
orders, and AGCom communicated its satisfaction on 9 August 2017.

Vodafone lodged an appeal with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court against the final decision in the
proceedings for non-compliance taken by AGCM. TIM filed an appearance, as it did in the further
proceedings brought in the month of March 2017 by the operators CloudItalia Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. a
socio unico, KPNQ West Italia S.p.A. and Digitel Italia S.p.A..


-----

**_Vodafone (A428)_**

In August 2013, Vodafone, as incorporating company of operator Teletu, submitted to the Milan Court a
huge claim for damages for presumed abusive and anticompetitive behaviour (founded principally on ICA
case A428) which TIM allegedly implemented in the period 2008-2013. The pecuniary claim was quantified
by Vodafone as an estimated sum of between 876 million euros and 1,029 million euros.

In particular, Vodafone alleged technical boycotting activities, with refusal to activate lines requested for
Teletu customers (in the period from 2008 to the month of June 2013), together with the adoption of
allegedly abusive price policies for wholesale network access services (in the period from 2008 to the month
of June 2013). Furthermore, the other party complained of the presumed offering of discounts to business
customers greater than those envisaged (“margin squeezing”) and the carrying out of presumed illegal and
anticompetitive winback practices (in the period from the second half of 2012 to the month of June 2013).

TIM filed an appearance, challenging the claims made by the other party regarding the merits and the
amount and making a counterclaim. Following the August 2016 decision by the Court of Cassation which
confirmed that the Milan Court had jurisdiction to decide the dispute, the merits of the case will be decided
at the hearing in December 2016.

With a writ of summons dated 28 May 2015 before the Milan Court, Vodafone has advanced further claims
for compensation, based on the same ICA case A428 and referring to alleged damages it suffered in the
period July 2013 to December 2014 (and therefore over a period of time subsequent to the period of the
similar compensatory judgment mentioned above), for approximately 568.5 million euros.

The case also contains a reservation of further damages to be quantified, during the proceedings, for the
following periods, the claimant alleging that the presumed abusive conduct of TIM continued. TIM filed an
appearance, challenging the claims made by the other party regarding the merits and the amount and making
a counterclaim.

In an order made on 6 October 2016, the judge accepted Vodafone’s petition to join the two A428
proceedings it had initiated. At the end of the reinstatement proceedings of 21 December, the terms were
established for the preliminary briefs and a hearing was fixed for 11 July 2017 for the admission of evidence.
When the first preliminary brief was filed, following the favourable outcome for TIM of proceedings A428C (which confirmed the absence of improper conduct by TIM under A428 after 2011), Vodafone decided
nonetheless to file further claims for 2015-2016, thus restating its total claim to be 1,812 million euros,
which was also disputed and rebutted by TIM.

**_COLT TECHNOLOGY SERVICES_**

With a writ of summons served in August 2015 before the Milan Court, operator Colt Technology Services
(Colt) claimed damages based on the decisive order in case A428, referring to alleged damages suffered
during the period 2009/2011, due to the presumed inefficient and discriminatory conduct of TIM in the
process of supplying wholesale services. The damage claimed was quantified as 27 million euros in loss of
profits for the alleged non-acquisition of new customers, or for the alleged impossibility of supplying new
services to the customers it had already acquired; the other party also formulated a request for compensation
for the damages to its image and commercial reputation. This case follows the extrajudicial claim for
approximately 23 million euros, previously advanced by Colt in June 2015, which TIM rejected in its
entirety. TIM filed an appearance, contesting all of the plaintiff’s allegations.

**_KPNQ West Italia S.p.A._**

With a writ of summons issued by the Rome Court, KPNQ West Italia sued TIM, claiming damages totalling
37 million euros for alleged abusive and anti-competitive conduct in the period 2009-2011, through technical
boycotting (refusal to activate wholesale services—KOs); these claims were based on the content of the
Italian Competition Authority ruling that settled the A428 case. The first hearing took place in May 2016.
TIM filed an appearance, contesting all of the plaintiff’s allegations.


-----

**_TELEUNIT_**

With a writ of summons before the Rome Court, Teleunit claimed 35.4 million euros in compensation from
TIM, based on the known decision of the Italian Competition Authority that settled the A428 case.
Specifically, the other party complained that in the period 2009/2010 it had suffered abusive conduct on
TIM’s part in the form of technical boycotting (refusal to activate network access services—KOs), and
anticompetitive practices in the form of margin squeezing (excessive squeezing of discount margins,
considered abusive inasmuch as it cannot be replicated by competitors). TIM filed an appearance, contesting
all of the plaintiff’s allegations.

With a writ of summons issued in October 2009 before the Milan Appeal Court, Teleunit asked that TIM
alleged acts of abuse of its dominant position in the premium services market be ascertained. The plaintiff
quantified its damages as a total of approximately 362 million euros. TIM filed an appearance, contesting the
claims of the other party.

After the ruling of January 2014 with which the Court of Appeal declared that it was not competent in this
matter and referred the case to the Court, Teleunit reinstated the case before the Milan Court the following
April. TIM filed an appearance in the reinstated proceedings challenging the plaintiff’s claims.

In its May 2017 judgment, the Milan Court rejected Teleunit’s claim in its entirety, and ordered the company
to pay the legal costs of the case. This judgment was appealed by Teleunit in June 2017 before the Milan
Court of Appeal. The company filed an appeal challenging the arguments presented by the other party and
asking that the judgment in the first instance be fully confirmed.

In March 2018, the Milan Court of Appeal declared Teleunit’s appeal as manifestly unfounded, pursuant to
Article 348-bis of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure.

**_SIPORTAL_**

The claim brought against TIM by Siportal is pending before the Rome Court. It claims a total of
approximately 48.4 million euros for alleged damages due to the technical boycotting it suffered from 2009
to 2011 and the inertial effects of the abuse since 2015, with the loss of commercial partners and further
customer acquisitions (the last damage item has been quantified as 25 million euros). The suit is based on the
known Competition Authority ruling that settled case A428. TIM filed an appearance, rejecting all of the
other party’s allegations.

**_Competition Authority case I-761_**

With a ruling issued on 10 July 2013, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) included TIM in the
investigation started in March 2013 into firms active in the fixed network maintenance sector. The
investigation aims to establish if an agreement prohibited under Article 101 of the TFEU existed among
firms.

The proceedings were initiated after Wind filed two complaints in which the ICA was informed that, based
on an invitation to bid for the assignment of network corrective maintenance services, it had encountered
substantial uniformity of prices offered by the aforementioned enterprises and a significant difference from
the offers submitted subsequently by other companies.

The ICA alleged that TIM carried out the role of coordinating the other parts of the procedure, both during
the formulation of the offers requested by Wind and in relation to the positions represented to
communications regulator AGCom.

TIM challenged these proceedings before the Administrative Court (TAR), claiming that the ICA does not
have competence in this matter.


-----

On 7 July 2014, the ICA announced the extension of the proceedings to confirm whether TIM, abusing its
dominant position, put in place initiatives that might influence the conditions of the offer of accessory
technical services when the offers of the maintenance businesses to Wind and Fastweb were being
formulated. With the extension provision, the ICA has also extended the deadline for closing the
proceedings from the original date of 31 July 2014 to 31 July 2015. This extension was also challenged
before the Lazio Administrative Court (TAR) claiming that the Italian Competition Authority does not have
competence in this matter.

In November 2014, for reasons of procedural economy and also convinced that it was acting legitimately,
TIM presented to the Authority a proposal of undertakings in order to resolve the competition concerns
which where the subject of the investigation. In its resolution of 19 December 2014, the ICA considered that
these undertakings were not manifestly groundless and later ordered their publication for the purposes of
market testing.

On 25 March 2015, the ICA definitively rejected the aforesaid undertakings, considering them not suitable
for removing the anticompetitive aspects investigated.

On 21 July 2015, the Communication of the Results of the Investigation was served on the parties to the
proceedings, in which the Offices of the ICA expressed their position in the sense of (i) archiving the
complaints regarding the abuse of dominant position and (ii) confirming instead that there exists between
TIM and the maintenance firms an agreement to coordinate the economic offers drawn up for Wind and
Fastweb, and to prevent the unbundled supply of the ancillary technical services.

On 16 December 2015, the final order was issued, confirming the conclusions of the Communication of the
Results of the Investigation, claiming that between 2012 and 2013 there existed an agreement that restricted
competition, and as a result imposed on TIM a fine of 21.5 million euros. In March 2016, TIM payed this
fine. The relevant market is the corrective maintenance (assurance) market and, more precisely, the market
for troubleshooting the TIM LLU lines. The purpose of the conduct maintained by TIM and the network
firms would have been to limit competition and prevent the evolution of forms of unbundled supply of
ancillary technical services.

TIM appealed the order before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. In judgment No. 09554/2016 issued
in September 2016, the appeal was dismissed, and TIM appealed this decision to the Council of State.

**_WIND (I-761)_**

With a writ of summons before the Court of Milan, Wind sought 57 million euros in compensation from
TIM for damages arising from alleged anti competitive conduct censured in the ICA case I-761 (on
corrective maintenance). According to the plaintiff, this conduct delayed and hindered its ability to obtain
more favourable conditions in the unbundled purchase of service to repair faults on the LLU access lines,
and their effects, initially stated to have been until December 2015 and subsequently alleged by Wind to be
ongoing, TIM filed an appearance challenging the plaintiff’s requests.

**_VODAFONE (I-761)_**

With a writ of summons before the Milan Court, Vodafone sued TIM and other network companies, seeking
compensation from TIM of approximately 193 million euros for damages arising from alleged anticompetitive conduct censured in the ICA case I-761 (on corrective maintenance) referring to the period from
2011 to 2017.

Vodafone alleges that TIM breached competition rules in the wholesale markets giving access to its fixed
network (LLU lines; Bitstream; WLR), through the abuse of a dominant market position and an unlawful
agreement with the maintenance companies to maintain the monopoly on the offer of corrective maintenance
services on its network. In particular this restrictive agreement would have concerned the coordination, by
TIM, of the financial conditions contained in the offers formulated by the aforementioned companies with
respect to the OLOs, for the maintenance service, at artificially high prices with respect to the cost of the


-----

maintenance included in the regulated access subscription charge, in order to make it seem as if the
unbundling of the service itself were not convenient. TIM filed an appearance, contesting all of the other
party’s requests.

**_Competition Authority case A514_**

In June 2017 AGCM opened case A514 against TIM to ascertain a possible abuse of its dominant market
position in breach of Article 102 of the TFEU. The proceedings were started based on complaints filed in
May and June 2017 by Infratel, Enel, Open Fiber, Vodafone and Wind Tre, and concerned a presumed abuse
of TIM’s dominant position in the market for wholesale access services and for retail services using the
broadband and ultrabroadband fixed network. In particular, the ICA hypothesized that TIM had adopted
conduct aimed at: i) slowing and hindering the course of the Infratel tender processes so as to delay, or
render less remunerative the entry of another operator in the wholesale market; ii) pre-emptively securing
customers on the retail market for ultrabroadband services by means of commercial policies designed to
restrict the space of customer contendibility remaining for the competitors.

After the start of the proceeding, the Authority’s officials carried out an inspection at some of TIM’s offices
in the month of July 2017. On 2 November 2017, TIM lodged a defence in which, in support of the
correctness of its actions, it challenged all the arguments that the behaviour it had allegedly indulged in, and
which was the object of the case, actually unlawful.

On 14 February 2018, AGCM decided to extend the scope of the proceeding, in order to carry out further
verification on conducts regarding TIM's wholesale pricing strategy in the market for wholesale broadband
and ultrabroadband access services and of the use of privileged information regarding competitors’
customers. The current timetable provides for such proceeding to be concluded by 31 October 2018.

**_Case “I799”_**

On 1 February 2017, AGCM opened a proceeding for possible breaches of Article 101 TFEU (a ban on
competition-restricting agreements) against TIM S.p.A. and Fastweb S.p.A., to assess potential anticompetitive agreements stemming from the creation of the joint venture Flash Fiber S.r.l.. TIM has
submitted several amendments to the agreements signed to the AGCM, in the form of proposed
commitments, aimed at settling the proceeding without accepting the violation and, therefore, without any
financial penalty.

On 9 April 2018, the AGCM notified the approval of the proposed commitments, making them binding on
the Parties, and terminated the proceeding without imposing any penalties.

**_Vodafone_**

In June 2015, Vodafone opened a proceeding for damages in the Milan Court for alleged abuse of a
dominant position by TIM in the bitstream “NGA” and “VULA” fiber access services market, initially
claiming around 4.4 million euros, increased to a figure ranging from 30 to 48.9 million euros.

The complaint alleged that TIM implemented aggressive offers to obtain customers while also hindering
Vodafone’s access to the fiber network, making it more difficult for it to provide ultrabroadband service to
its customers.

TIM filed an appearance contesting all of the allegations of the other party, and subsequently also its revision
of the size of the damages claimed during the proceeding in 2016.

**_EUTELIA and VOICEPLUS_**

In June 2009, Eutelia S.p.A. (Eutelia) and Voiceplus asked that alleged acts of abuse by TIM of its dominant
position in the premium services market (based on the public offer of services provided through so-called


-----

Non Geographic Numbers) be investigated. The complainants quantified their damages as a total of
approximately 730 million euros.

The case follows a precautionary procedure in which the Milan Appeal Court prohibited certain behaviours
of TIM relating to the management of some financial relations with Eutelia and Voiceplus concerning the
Non Geographic Numbers, for which TIM managed the payments from the end customers, on behalf of such
OLOs and in the light of regulatory requirements. After the ruling with which the Milan Court of Appeal
accepted TIM’s objections, declaring that it was not competent in this matter and referring the case to the
Civil Court, Eutelia in extraordinary administration and Voiceplus in liquidation resubmitted the matter to
the Milan Court. The first hearing took place in the month of March 2014. TIM filed an appearance
challenging the claims of the other parties. After the collapse of Voiceplus, the Milan Court declared the case
suspended, in an order in September 2015. The case was later resumed by Voiceplus.

With a judgment issued in February 2018, the Milan Court accepted TIM’s defence and rejected the
plaintiffs’ claim for compensation, ordering them to pay the legal costs.

In March 2018, Eutelia and Voiceplus appealed the decision at first instance, and as at the date of this EMTN
Base Prospectus, such appeal remains pending.

**_SKY_**

In 2016, TIM initiated civil proceeding against SKY Italia in the Milan Court, asking the court to void a
contract signed by the two companies in April 2014 for the delivery and marketing, between 2015 and 2019,
of the SKY IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) offer on the TIM IPTV platform, due to abuse of dominant
position by Sky Italia.

In the alternative, TIM also asked the court to reduce to a fair level the amounts demanded by SKY by way
of the so-called Guaranteed Minimums (“penalties”), alleging that they were established to SKY’s advantage
and related to predetermined customer sign-up and churn-rate thresholds in the five years of the partnership.

SKY filed an appearance in February 2017, challenging TIM’s claim and demanding payment of the
Guaranteed Minimums it claimed to have accrued, a request which was opposed by TIM. The proceedings
are ongoing and the last hearing occurred on 29 May 2018 with the assignment of the terms for the final
pleas (30 July 2018 and 19 September 2018).

**_28 days billing_**

Resolution 121/17/CONS of 24 March 2017, with which AGCom supplemented its resolution
252/16/CONS, constitutes the concluding act of a regulatory process intended to safeguard price
transparency and comparability of economic terms and conditions.

Resolution 121/17/CONS, inter alia, introduced instructions on billing intervals for telephony, prescribing,
specifically for fixed telephony, that the interval should be monthly, or multiples thereof, and, for mobile
telephony, that it should be at least four-weekly.

TIM appealed Resolution 121/17/CONS to the Regional Administrative Court, alleging that AGCom was
exceeding its powers; the judgement rejecting the appeal was published on 12 February 2018. On 4 May
2018 the related grounds were published. TIM will challenge the decision in front of the Council of State.

In December 2017, AGCom, with Resolution 499/17/CONS, found that TIM had breached the provisions of
Resolution 121/17, by adopting intervals of a month, or multiples thereof, as the basis for billing its fixed
telephony offers. It fined TIM 1,160,000 euros, ordering it take action—when the billing cycle was restored
to monthly or multiples thereof—to reverse the charges levied for the number of days after 23 June 2017 that
the users had not used the service due to the lack of alignment between the four-weekly and the monthly
billing cycle.


-----

TIM also appealed this second Resolution to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, asking for a
preliminary suspension which, on 22 February 2018, was accepted by the Regional Administrative Court of
Lazio limited to the reimbursement orders and scheduling the hearing for consideration of the merits on 14
November 2018.

Law No. 172 of 4 December 2017 decreed that contracts for the supply of electronic communications
services should obligatorily prescribe that the renewal of offers and the invoicing of services be based on a
month, or multiples thereof.

TIM complied with this order within the period of time prescribed by law, namely, within 120 days of its
entry (5 April 2018).

On 7 March 2018, TIM was notified of a further resolution (Resolution 112/2018/CONS) with which
AGCom (i) warned TIM, with regard to fixed phone services only, to postpone the starting date of invoices
issued after the return to monthly invoicing by the same number of days as those presumably deducted
starting from 23 June 2017 with the four-weekly invoicing cycle; and (ii) revoked in the part resolution
499/17/CONS, in which TIM was warned to reverse the amounts presumed eroded starting from 23/6/2017
with the four-weekly invoicing cycle.

The aforesaid resolution was challenged by TIM on 16 March 2018 by way of petition setting out additional
grounds to be inserted within the framework of the appeal against resolution 499/17/CONS with a request for
individual precautionary measures, provisionally accepted up to boardroom level on 11 April 2018, with a
presidential decree published on 26 March 2017.

On 9 April 2018 AGCOM issued the Presidential Decree No. 9/18/PRES with which it has de facto amended
the Resolution No. 112/18/CONS, providing for specific hearings with each operator and Consumer
Associations to determine the timing of the reimbursement and, therefore, TIM and the other operators
involved in the presidential decree have renounced to the precautionary request. On 7 May 2018, TIM also
challenged the Presidential Decree AGCOM No. 9/18/PRES and Resolution No. 187/18/CONS which
ratified this decree.

Lastly, on 19 February 2018 the AGCM initiated a I820 preliminary, statutory investigation against the
companies TIM, Vodafone, Fastweb, Wind-Tre and the Association of category (ASSTEL) to determine
whether an understanding existed aiming to limit competition between the main fixed and mobile telephony
operators through the coordination of their respective commercial strategies in violation of art. 101 TFEU.
The alleged coordination, according to AGCM, would have been carried out through the execution of the
obligations introduced by Article 19 _quinquiesdecies of the Law by Decree No. 148 of 16 October 2017_
(converted into Law No. 172 of 4 December 2017) which requires operators of electronic communication
services to provide monthly (or more than once a month) invoicing and renewal of the offers for fixed and
mobile services.

On 21 March 2018, AGCM issued a provisional precautionary measure against all the operators involved in
the proceedings with which it ordered the suspension, pending the proceedings, of the implementation of the
agreement concerning the determination of repricing communicated to users at the time of reformulating the
billing cycle in compliance with Law No. 172 of 4 December 2017 and to independently redetermine its
commercial strategy.

On 13 April 2018, the order with which the AGCM confirmed the precautionary measure was published. The
current timetable for the conclusion of the proceedings is 31 March 2019.

**_Golden Power_**

In August 2017 the office of the Prime Minister initiated proceedings against TIM and Vivendi in order to
verify the fact that TIM has an obligation to notify, pursuant to the Golden Power provisions, Vivendi’s
acquisition of corporate control of TIM and the strategic assets it holds. In September 2017, the proceedings


-----

in question concluded by ascertaining that this obligation did exist for TIM effective as of 4 May 2017 the
date of the shareholders’ meeting that renewed TIM’s corporate bodies.

As a result of this decision of the office of the Prime Minister, a new administrative procedure was started
for the possible imposition on TIM of a pecuniary sanction pursuant to the Golden Power provisions for noncompliance with the notification obligation. Such proceeding was concluded on 8 May 2018 with the
imposition of a fine of 74.3 million euros.

TIM believes it will be able to demonstrate that there were no obligations to notify with respect to Vivendi’s
control and it has already submitted an extraordinary appeal to the President of the Italian Republic to
request the cancellation of the order of September 2017, as well as TIM is conducting all legal assessments
of the potential actions it could take to protect itself following the 8 May 2018 resolution.

As a result of these assessments, TIM has commenced legal action at Tar Lazio to obtain the annulment of
the fine and, in the meantime, has obtained the suspension of the payment of the fine through an interim and
precautionary decision taken by Tar Lazio, which has scheduled the public hearing for discussing the request
of suspension for July 2018.

Moreover, the office of the Prime Minister exercised the special powers laid down by the Golden Power
provision through two specific rulings in October and November 2017 with which it set specific
prescriptions and conditions on TIM S.p.A. and the companies of the Telecom Italia group Sparkle and Telsy
Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni.

The prescriptions, according to the Administrative Authority, are premised on the understanding that these
companies, in part, perform activities relevant for national security and as far as TIM is concerned to the fact
that it also owns the infrastructure and the systems used to provide access to end-users of services covered by
the universal service obligation.

Any failure on the part of the recipients of the orders to execute the conditions and prescriptions is
sanctioned in the same way as failure to notify significant acts for the purpose of the application of Golden
Power provisions.

The companies subject to the prescriptions are required to send periodic reports to a special Monitoring
Committee established at the office of the Prime Minister in order to verify compliance with the
aforementioned prescriptions.

In December 2017, the Group sent the office of the Prime Minister the first compliance report outlining all of
the proposals and activities put in place to follow through with the prescriptions.

TIM has also submitted an extraordinary appeal to the President of the Republic in this instance to request
cancellation of the orders in question.

**_Vodafone Dispute—Universal Service_**

In a decision published in July 2015, the Council of State rejected the appeal lodged by AGCom and TIM
against the judgment of the Lazio Administrative Court (TAR) on the financing of the universal service
obligations for the period 1999-2003; with this judgment the judge had granted the appeals by Vodafone,
annulling AGCom decisions 106, 107, 109/11/CONS on the renewal of the related proceedings, which
included Vodafone among the subjects required to contribute, for a sum of approximately 38 million euros.
Essentially, the judgment confirms that the Authority has not demonstrated the particular degree of
“replaceability” between fixed and mobile telephony for mobile operators to be included among the subjects
required to repay the cost of the universal service, which means that AGCom needs to issue a new ruling.

TIM has filed an application with AGCom to renew the proceedings, and an appeal against the judgment of
the Court of Appeal to the Court of Cassation (which subsequently ruled that the appeal was inadmissible).


-----

In April 2016 Vodafone appealed against the Ministry of Economic Development and TIM to the Council of
State, for non-compliance with the judgment of the Council of State that had already been appealed by TIM.
This appeal referred to AGCom decision 109/11/CONS (2003 yearly payment, on the basis of which
Vodafone had paid the sum of approximately 9 million euros as contribution, restitution of which was
requested).

In its judgment of November 2016, the Council of State rejected the appeal, referring to the Regional
Administrative Court (TAR) the decision on the methods of compliance. In February 2017, Vodafone
presented the Lazio Regional Administrative Court with four new appeals against the Ministry of Economic
Development and TIM regarding observance of the ruling, upheld on appeal, countermanding the resolutions
for the years 1999-2003 and repayment of the amounts of around 38 million euros already paid to the
Ministry of Economic Development as a contribution.

**_Dispute relative to “Adjustments on license fees” for the years 1994-1998_**

With respect to the judgments sought in previous years concerning the Ministry of Communications’ request
for payment of the balance of the amounts paid in concession charges for the years 1994-1998 (for a total of
113 million euros), the Administrative Court (TAR) for Lazio rejected TIM’s appeal against the request for
adjustment of the license fee for 1994 in the amount of approximately 11 million euros, 9 million euros of
which against turnover not received due to bad debts. TIM lodged an appeal.

With two further judgments the Administrative Court (TAR) for Lazio, reiterating the reasons expressed
previously, also rejected the appeals in which TIM challenged the requests for payment of outstanding
balances of license fees for the years 1995 and 1996-1997-1998, in the amount of approximately 46 million
euros. TIM has appealed before the Council of State also against these judgments.

**_Olivetti—Asbestos exposure_**

In September 2014 the Ivrea Public Prosecutor’s Office closed the investigations into the alleged exposure to
asbestos of 15 former employees of “Ing. C. Olivetti S.p.A.” (now TIM S.p.A.), “Olivetti Controllo
Numerico S.p.A”, “Olivetti Peripheral Equipment S.p.A.”, “Sixtel S.p.A.” and “Olteco S.p.A” and served
notice that the investigations had been concluded on the 39 people investigated (who include former
Directors of the aforementioned companies).

On December 2014 the Ivrea Public Prosecutor’s Office formulated a request for 33 of the 39 people
originally investigated to be committed for trial, and at the same time asked that 6 investigations be archived.

During the preliminary hearing, which started in April 2015, TIM assumed the role of civilly liable party,
after being formally summonsed by all 26 civil parties (institutions and natural persons) joined in the
proceedings. At the end of the preliminary hearing, 18 of the original 33 persons accused were committed for
trial. The trial started in November 2015, and, as the party liable for damages, TIM has reached a settlement
agreement with 12 of the 18 individuals (heirs/injured persons/family members) who are civil parties to the
dispute and they have, therefore, withdrawn the claim for damages against TIM.

In the judgment of first instance, in July 2016, 13 of the 18 defendants were found guilty, with sentences
ranging from 1 year to 5 years of imprisonment: four of the defendants were found not guilty, and one case
was dismissed for health reasons. The defendants were also sentenced to pay compensation, jointly and
severally with the party liable for damages TIM, of an overall sum of approximately 1.9 million euros as a
provisional payment to INAIL and 6 heirs who were not part of the settlement. A generic judgment to pay
compensation for damages to the remaining damaged parties (entities/unions/associations) was issued,
although they must in any case ask the civil court to quantify the damages.

TIM has challenged the reasons for the first instance ruling and the proceedings are now pending before the
Court of Appeal of Turin. TIM also signed settlement agreements with the last 6 heirs that were civil party,
reaching settlements with all the heirs and family members who had been civil parties in the criminal
proceedings.


-----

In April 2018, the Court of Appeal of Turin, overruled the judgement at first instance and acquitted each of
the defendants on the basis of insufficient grounds, and indicated a 90 days deadline to file the enforcement
order.

**_Alfiere S.p.A. - Arbitrators TIM-CDP Immobiliare_**

Alfiere S.p.A. is a 50-50 joint venture between TIM and CDP Immobiliare S.r.l. (CDPI) and owns the
property complex called "Torri dell'Eur". Following the restructuring work and the conclusion of the lease
agreement, the towers were intended to house TIM's headquarters. As a result of events connected with the
revocation of the building permit, a lengthy dispute arose before the administrative judge, which, as at the
date of this EMTN Base Prospectus, is still pending and, against CDPI, TIM also instigated two arbitration
proceedings before the Rome Chamber of Commerce - Arbitration Chamber, in order to: (i) ascertain that
CDPI is under an obligation to pay compensation to it for the extraordinary contribution requested by Roma
Capitale from Alfiere in the amount of 24 million euros and (ii) ascertain that TIM has no rental obligation
due to failure to deliver the property by 31 December 2017. In the context of this second arbitration
proceeding, CDPI requested, by way of counterclaim, the termination of all the contracts stipulated with TIM
in relation to Alfiere and an order that TIM pay compensation for the related damages quantified as more
than 88 million euros.

**_POSTE_**

There are some pending disputes at the end of 1990s, brought by Ing. C. Olivetti & C. S.p.A. (now TIM)
against Poste Italiane S.p.A., the Italian postal service, concerning non-payment of services rendered under a
series of contracts to supply IT goods and services. The judgments issued in the lower courts established an
outcome that was partially favourable to the ex-Olivetti, and have been appealed against by Poste in
individual re- hearings.

In this respect, while a judgment of the Rome Appeal Court in 2009 confirmed one of the outstanding
payables to TIM, another judgment by the same Court declared void one of the disputed contracts. After this
judgment, Poste had issued a writ for the return of approximately 58 million euros, opposed by TIM given
that the judgment of the Supreme Court for amendment of the above judgment is still pending.

After the judgment of the Supreme Court in 2012 that quashed and remanded the decision of the Appeal
Court on which the order was based, the Rome Court declared that the matter of issue in the enforcement
proceedings was discontinued, since the claim made by Poste had been rejected. The judgment was
resubmitted to another section of the Rome Appeal Court.

**_Elinet S.p.A. Bankruptcy_**

The receivers of collapsed Elinet S.p.A., and subsequently the receivers of Elitel S.r.l. and Elitel Telecom
S.p.A (the controller of the Elitel group at the time), have appealed in 2014 the judgment with which the
Rome Court rejected the claims for compensation made by the receivers of Elinet-Elitel, reproposing a claim
for damages totalling 282 million euros. The claims made involve the alleged performance of management
and coordination activities of the plaintiff, and with it the Elitel group (alternative operator in which TIM has
never had any type of interest), allegedly enacted by playing the card of trade receivables management. TIM
filed an appearance, challenging the claims made by the other party.

**Brazil - Opportunity Arbitration**

In May 2012, TIM and Telecom Italia International N.V (now merged in Telecom Italia Finance) were
served with a notice of arbitration proceedings brought by the Opportunity group, claiming compensation for
damages allegedly suffered for presumed breach of a settlement agreement signed in 2005. Based on the
claimant’s allegations, the damages relate to circumstances that emerged in the criminal proceedings pending
before the Milan Court regarding, inter alia, unlawful activities engaged in by former employees of TIM.


-----

The investigatory phase having been completed, the hearing for oral discussion took place in November
2014, after which the parties filed their concluding arguments in preparation for the decision on the case.

In September 2015, the Board of Arbitration declared the proceedings closed.

Subsequently, the Board of Arbitration allowed the parties to exchange short arguments and the ICC
(International Chamber of Commerce) Court extended the term for the filing of the award.

In September 2016 the ICC Court notified the parties of its judgment, based on which the Board of
Arbitration rejected all the claims made by the Opportunity group and decided that the legal costs,
administrative costs and costs for expert witnesses should be split between the parties.

In April 2017, the Opportunity group filed an appeal against the arbitration award before the Paris Court of
Appeal.

In November 2017, TIM and Telecom Italia Finance received from the Secretariat of the ICC’s International
Court of Arbitration notice of a Request for Revision of the arbitration award filed by the Opportunity group,
asking for the issuance of a new award on the basis of the requests made in the Opportunity Arbitration. The
Board of Arbitration is in the process of being constituted.

**_Brazil—CAM JVCO Arbitration_**

In September 2015, JVCO Participações Ltda filed a request for arbitration before the Camara de Arbitragem
do Mercado (CAM), based in Rio de Janeiro, against TIM, Telecom Italia International, (today merged into
Telecom Italia Finance-TIF), Tim Brasil Serviços e Participações S.A. and Tim Participações S.A., claiming
compensation for damages due to an alleged abuse of controlling power over TIM Participações. The
following October, all the companies entered appearances and filed statements of defence, and Tim
Participações, by way of a counter-claim, called for the condemnation of JVCO for abuse of its position as
minority shareholder.

A Board of Arbitration was subsequently established, and in May 2016 there was a preliminary hearing, at
which the Terms of Reference were signed. After the hearing, the Board of Arbitration issued a procedural
order accepting the Group’s request for a preliminary examination of the issue of whether JVCO were
entitled to bring proceedings and establishing a provisional schedule for the arbitration. In June the parties
exchanged claims and counterclaims, and in their defence TIM, Telecom Italia International, Tim Brasil
Serviços e Participações S.A. and Tim Participações S.A. contested the other party’ entitlement to bring
proceedings and the standing to be sued of Tim Participações, and disputed that there was any abuse of
power. In July 2016, the parties filed their responses. On 19 October 2016 the Board of Arbitration issued a
preliminary procedural order on the legitimacy of the proceedings brought by the parties, upholding the right
of JVCO to bring the claim and the standing to be sued of Tim Participações, and fixing the timetable for
subsequent replies by the parties. On 21 November and 19 December 2016 the parties filed further replies.
On 31 January 2017, the Board of Arbitration issued a procedural order, ruling on trial questions,
summarising the principal disputed questions in the proceedings and making provision in relation to the
preliminary investigation. The parties then indicated the evidence they intend to submit in court.
Subsequently the Board of Arbitration fixed the dates for the hearings.

The hearings took place in Rio De Janeiro in June 2017 and were followed by further filings of
documentation and pleadings.

In March 2018, all the parties to the proceedings filed their final briefs.

**a)** **OTHER INFORMATION**

**Mobile telephony—criminal proceedings**

In March 2012 TIM was served notice of the conclusion of the preliminary enquiries, which showed that
TIM was being investigated by the Public Prosecutor of Milan pursuant to the Legislative Decree n.
231/2001, for the offences of handling stolen goods and counterfeiting committed, according to the alleged
allegations, by fourteen employees of the so-called “ethnic channel”, with the participation of a number of
dealers, for the purpose of obtaining undeserved commissions from TIM.

TIM, as the injured party damaged by such conduct, had brought two legal actions in 2008 and 2009 and had
proceeded to suspend the employees involved in the criminal proceedings (suspension later followed by
dismissal). It has also filed an initial statement of defence, together with a technical report by its own expert,
requesting that the proceedings against it be suspended, and that charges of aggravated fraud against TIM be
brought against the other defendants. In December 2012, the Public Prosecutor’s Office filed a request for 89
defendants and TIM itself to be committed for trial.

During the preliminary hearing, TIM was admitted as civil party to the trial and, in November 2013, the
conclusions in the interest of the civil party were filed, reaffirming TIM’s total lack of involvement in the
offences claimed.

At the end of the preliminary hearing, which took place in March 2014, the Judge for the Preliminary
Hearing committed for trial all the defendants (including TIM) who had not asked for their situation to be
settled with alternative procedures, on the grounds that “examination in a trial” was needed. In April 2016, at
the end of the first part of the trial, the Public Prosecutor asked for TIM to be sentenced to pay an
administrative fine of 900 thousand euros, but decided not to ask for confiscation of any of the presumed
profits of the offences (quantified in the committal proceedings as totalling several million euros), based on
the assumption that TIM had in any event remedied the presumed organizational inadequacies. While
acknowledging the considerable redimensioning of the accusations, TIM has reiterated its total
non-involvement in the facts at issue. In November 2016 the Court gave a verdict acquitting TIM on the
grounds that there was no case to answer. All the individuals charged were also acquitted on various
grounds. The acquittal judgment is not final, as it was challenged in April 2017 by the Public Prosecutor who
sought appeal before the Court of Cassation. The hearing will be held in June 2018.

**_Dispute concerning the license fees for 1998_**

TIM has issued civil proceedings against the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri (the office of the Prime
Minister) for compensation of the damage caused by the Italian State through appeal judgment No. 7506/09
by the Council of State that, in the view of TIM, violates the principles of current European community law.

The main claim which the proceedings are founded on is based on community jurisprudence that recognizes
the right to assert the responsibility of the State in relation to violation of rights recognised in community law
and injured by a judgment that has become definitive, in respect of which no other remedy may be applied.
The judgment of the Council of State definitively denied the right of TIM to restitution of the concession
charge for 1998 (totalling 386 million euros for Telecom Italia and 143 million euros for the former TIM
Company, plus interest), already denied by the Lazio regional administrative court despite the favourable and
binding opinion of the European Court of Justice in February 2008 concerning the conflict between EC
Directive 97/13 on general authorisations and individual licences in the telecommunications services
industry, and the national regulations that had deferred, for 1998, the obligation to pay the fee payable by
telecommunications concession holders, despite the intervening deregulation process. TIM then proposed an
alternative compensation claim, within the sphere of the same proceedings, for tort pursuant to art. 2043 of
the Italian Civil Code. The compensation claimed has been quantified as approximately 529 million euros,
plus legal interest and revaluation. The _Avvocatura di Stato filed an appearance and submitted a_
counterclaim for the same sum. The case is subject to eligibility analysis by the Court, which declared the
inadmissibility of TIM’s main claim (case for damages for manifest breach of community law pursuant to
Law 117 of 13 April 1988). However, this decision was amended in favour of TIM on appeal. In March 2015


-----

the Rome Court issued its judgment in the first instance, declaring TIM’s application inadmissible. TIM has
appealed this decision and the judgment is pending in the closing arguments phase.

**_Vodafone (previously TELETU)_**

There is a pending litigation for compensation started by TIM with a summons dated February 2012 against
the operator TELETU (now incorporated into Vodafone) for unlawful refusals regarding reactivation with
TIM of the competitor’s customers. The claim was quantified as approximately 93 million euros.

**_Other liabilities connected with the disposal of assets and investments_**

Within the scope of agreements for the sale of assets and companies, the TIM Group committed to
indemnifying the purchasers in the event of liabilities mainly arising in connection with issues of a legal, tax,
social security or labour law nature, at an amount normally set as a percentage of the purchase price.

The contingent liabilities in question amount to approximately 500 million euros. Accordingly, a total of
approximately 20 million euros in provisions for risks were allocated to cover only those cases considered
likely to result in the payment of an indemnity.

In relation to other sales of assets and investments, the TIM Group committed to the payment of other
indemnities relating to specific contractual provisions. The contingent liability connected with such
indemnities cannot be presently determined.

**TIM GROUP – SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND STATISTICAL OPERATING**

**DATA**

**Financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS as of and for the years ended 31 December**
**2017 and 2016**

The selected financial data set forth below is consolidated financial data of the TIM Group as of and for each
of the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, which has been extracted or derived from the audited
Consolidated Financial Statements of the TIM Group included in the 2017 TIM Annual Report (which is
incorporated by reference herein) and which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A. as
independent auditors.

In 2017, the TIM Group applied the accounting policies on a basis consistent with those of the previous
years, except for the new standards and interpretations adopted by the Group since 1 January 2017, described
in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the TIM Group included in the 2017 TIM Annual Report
and incorporated by reference herein.

The financial information described below should be read in conjunction with the 2017 TIM Annual Report.

Amounts presented in this section are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The selected financial data set forth below includes, in addition to the conventional financial performance
measures established by IFRS, certain alternative performance measures (such as Operating profit
(loss)/Revenues (ROS), Net Financial Debt) that are presented for purposes of a better understanding of the
trend of operations and the financial condition. Such measures should, however, not be considered as a
substitute for those required by IFRS.

In particular, as regards to Operating profit (loss)/Revenues (ROS), TIM believes that such measure
represents an accurate indicator of how efficiently the Group is generating profits from its top-line revenues.
In fact, ROS measures the performance of an entity by analysing the percentage of total revenues that is
converted into operating profit. This financial measure is used by TIM in internal and external presentations
to analysts and investors. ROS is also used to compare current period calculations with calculations from
previous periods. This allows TIM to conduct trend analysis and compare internal efficiency performance
over time.

For further details about Net Financial Debt please also see note 5 below.

Notes:
(*) On 13 November 2013, TIM accepted the offer of Fintech Telecom, LLC (Fintech Group) to acquire the entire controlling
interest of TIM Group in the Sofora — Telecom Argentina group. The agreements made in connection with this transaction
were subsequently modified in October 2014. As a result, and in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for
_Sale and Discontinued Operations), starting with the fourth quarter of 2013, the Sofora —Telecom Argentina group has_
been treated as Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale. On 8 March 2016, the TIM Group completed the
sale of Sofora —Telecom Argentina group.
(1) For the purposes of IFRS, “Parent”, as used in this EMTN Programme Prospectus and in the 2017 TIM Annual Report,
means TIM S.p.A.
(2) In accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings per share), basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Group’s
profit (loss) available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding
treasury shares. Since TIM has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the
requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of 0.55 euros per share above
dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares.
For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of:

     - Ordinary Shares was 15,039,368,195 for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 15,039,128,128 for the year
ended 31 December 2016;

     - Savings Shares was 6,027,791,699 for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all
dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number
of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and
convertible securities. The Group’s profit (loss) is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares
net of the related tax effects.
(3) TIM’s dividend coupons for its Savings Shares for the year ended 31 December 2017, will be clipped on 18 June 2018 and
will be payable from 20 June 2018.
(4) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the accounting par value of treasury shares; accounting par value is the
ratio of total share capital and the number of issued shares.
(5) In order to present a more realistic analysis of net financial debt, in addition to the usual indicator (renamed “Net Financial
Debt carrying amount”), “Adjusted Net Financial Debt” is also shown; such indicator excludes effects that are purely
accounting and non-monetary in nature deriving from the fair value measurement of derivatives and related financial assets
and liabilities. Net Financial Debt is one of the alternative performance measures presented in addition to the conventional
financial performance measures established by IFRS for purposes of a better understanding of the trend of operations and
the financial condition of the TIM Group. Specifically, TIM believes that Net Financial Debt provides an accurate indicator
of its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents and
other Financial Assets. Net Financial Debt is also used in presentations to investors and analysts. Adjusted Net Financial
Debt as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is calculated as follows:


-----

**As of 31 December**
**2017** **2016**
_(millions of euros)_

**Financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS as of and for the three months ended 31**
**March 2018 and 2017**

The summary selected financial data set forth below, which has been extracted or derived from the TIM
Group’s Quarterly Report at 31 March 2018, is consolidated financial data of the TIM Group as follows:

(i) with respect to the separate consolidated income statement information, the unaudited financial data
for the three month periods ended 31 March 2018 and 2017; and

(ii) with respect to the statement of financial position information, the unaudited financial data as of 31
March 2018 and the audited financial data as of 31 December 2017.

The accounting policies and consolidation principles adopted in the preparation of the TIM Group’s
Quarterly Report at 31 March 2018 are the same as those adopted in the TIM Group annual Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31 December 2017, to which reference can be made, except for the
adoption of the new accounting principles adopted from 1 January 2018, the effects of which are described in
the section "Adoption of the new IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards" of the TIM Group’s Quarterly Report at 31
March 2018 to which reference should be made for further details.

In the opinion of the management of TIM, the unaudited interim consolidated financial data included in the
TIM Group’s Quarterly Report at 31 March 2018 reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the TIM Group’s consolidated results of
operations for the unaudited interim periods. Results for the three month period ended 31 March 2018 are not
necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.

There were no material events or transactions (e.g. business combinations, disposals, significant transactions
with related parties, including intragroup transactions) which would have required specific disclosure in this
EMTN Programme Prospectus.

The selected financial data set forth below includes, in addition to the conventional financial performance
measures established by IFRS, certain alternative performance measures (such as Operating profit
(loss)/Revenues (ROS), Net Financial Debt) that are presented for purposes of a better understanding of the
trend of operations and the financial condition. Such measures should, however, not be considered as a
substitute for those required by IFRS.

In particular, as regards to Operating profit (loss)/Revenues (ROS), TIM believes that such measure
represents an accurate indicator of how efficiently the Group is generating profits from its top-line revenues.
In fact, ROS measures the performance of an entity by analysing the percentage of total revenues that is

to analysts and investors. ROS is also used to compare current period calculations with calculations from
previous periods. This allows TIM to conduct trend analysis and compare internal efficiency performance
over time.

**DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND STATUTORY AUDITORS**

**Directors**

On 4 May 2017, the Shareholders’ Meeting of the Issuer elected the Board of Directors of TIM which will
remain in office until approval of the 2019 annual financial statements.

The Shareholders’ Meeting (i) established the number of Directors at 15, (ii) set the overall annual
remuneration for the Board of Directors at 2,200,000 euros (to be divided among the members thereof in
accordance with the resolutions to be adopted by the Board itself) and (iii) released them from restrictions on
competition, as permitted under Article 2390 of the Italian Civil Code.

The Board of Directors of TIM, at a meeting held on 5 May 2017 appointed Giuseppe Recchi as Executive
Chairman, Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine as Deputy Chairman and Flavio Cattaneo as Chief Executive Officer
of the Issuer.

On 1 June 2017 the Board of Directors of TIM met again and appointed Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine as
Executive Chairman and Giuseppe Recchi as Deputy Chairman; Flavio Cattaneo remains the Issuer’s Chief
Executive Officer.

On 24 July 2017, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation, effective 28 July 2017, of Flavio Cattaneo
as Chief Executive Officer and from the Board of Directors. In the meeting held on 27 July 2017, the Board
of Directors temporarily reassigned the responsibilities of Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman
Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine, except for those responsibilities related to the Security Function and the
company Telecom Italia Sparkle, which have been assigned, on an interim basis, to the Deputy Chairman,
Giuseppe Recchi.

Subsequently, on 28 September 2017, the Board of Directors appointed Amos Genish as Chief Executive
Officer and as General Manager. The Board of Directors also renewed the appointments of Arnaud Roy de
Puyfontaine as Executive Chairman and Giuseppe Recchi as Deputy Executive Chairman.

During the Board meeting of 22 March 2018, Giuseppe Recchi resigned effective immediately. Franco
Bernabè was appointed as Deputy Chairman and the Board reassigned to him the powers over the Security
department and those activities and assets of TIM that are important from a defence and national security
perspective. Additionally, during the same Board meeting of 22 March 2018, each of the following members
resigned, effective April 24, 2018, before the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on 24 April 2018: Arnaud de
Puyfontaine, Camilla Antonini, Frédéric Crépin, Félicité Herzog, Anna Jones, Marella Moretti and Hervé
Philippe. As a consequence, the Board of Directors called for a meeting of the Ordinary Shareholders to be
held on 4 May 2018 for the renewal of the Board of Directors.

At the Shareholders Meeting on 4 May 2018 a new Board of Directors was elected. The Shareholders
meeting established that the Board is composed of 15 members and its term of office is for three financial
years (until the approval of the financial statements as of 31 December 2020).

The slate presented by the shareholders Elliott lnternational LP, Elliott Associates LP e The Liverpool
Limited Partnership received more votes: as a consequence, the following 10 Directors were appointed, all
independent: Fulvio Conti, Alfredo Altavilla, Massimo Ferrari, Paola Giannotti De Ponti, Luigi Gubitosi,
Paola Bonomo, Maria Elena Cappello, Lucia Morselli, Dante Roscini and Rocco Sabelli (all independent).

The second slate was the one presented by Vivendi, so that the remaining 5 Directors were elected from such
slate: Amos Genish, Arnaud Roy de Puyfontaine, Marella Moretti, Michele Valensise and Giuseppina
Capaldo (these last three declared themselves independent).

On 7 May 2018, the Board of Directors of TIM appointed Fulvio Conti as Chairman and Amos Genish as

In February 2016, the District Court of Milan issued an indictment against Mr. Piergiorgio Peluso and 11
other individuals in connection with an investigation stemming from the bankruptcy of Imco S.p.A. (Imco)
in 2012. The principal allegation against Mr. Peluso is that, as CEO of UniCredit Corporate Banking S.p.A.
(UniCredit) (the position he held before joining TIM in September 2012), he approved a complex
restructuring transaction, which had, according to the allegation, the effect of decreasing the net asset value
of Imco. The trial in this matter is scheduled to begin in December 2018.

Pursuant to Italian law, the Board of Statutory Auditors supervises compliance by the company with the law,
the by-laws, the principles of proper administration and controls and the suitability of the structure and the
functioning of the company’s management, administrative and accounting functions. The Board of Statutory
Auditors additionally supervises suitability of the instructions given by TIM to its subsidiaries. The Board of
Statutory Auditors must receive timely disclosures, at least on a quarterly basis, from the Board of Directors
in relation to the company’s business and significant transactions performed by the company and its
subsidiaries, including related parties transactions. The Board of Statutory Auditors must inform CONSOB
of any irregularity they find in the course of their duties and are required to attend meetings of the
Shareholders, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. In addition, pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/2001, the Board of Auditors carries out the function of the Supervisory Committee.

TIM has adopted “Procedures for Information to Directors and Auditors”, in order to make available to the
Board of Auditors the necessary information.

Legislative Decree No. 39/2010, implementing directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts
and consolidated accounts, imposes on listed Italian companies the obligation to establish Internal Control
and Audit Committees. Since TIM adopted the Italian “traditional” system of administration and control, the
role of this Committee is performed by the Board of Statutory Auditors. Pursuant to Legislative Decree No.


-----

39/2010, the Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for monitoring: (i) the financial reporting process;
(ii) the suitability of internal control, internal audit and risk management systems; (iii) the statutory audit of
the annual and consolidated accounts; and (iv) the independence of the statutory auditor or independent audit
firm, particularly insofar as non-audit services are concerned.

In addition, according to Rule 10A-3 under the 1934 Act and NYSE listing standards, the Board of Statutory
Auditors has been identified to act as TIM’s Audit Committee. The Board of Statutory Auditors meets the
requirements of the general exemption contained in Rule 10A-3(c)(3):

- the Board of Statutory Auditors is appointed pursuant to applicable Italian law and TIM’s by-laws;

- pursuant to Italian law, the Board of Statutory Auditors is independent from the Board of Directors;

- the Board of Statutory Auditors is not elected by the management of TIM and no executive officer is
a member of the Board of Statutory Auditors;

- each member of the Board of Statutory Auditors meets specific independence requirements with
respect to TIM and its Group, the management and the auditing firm, in compliance with the law;

- the Board of Statutory Auditors, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Italian law, is
responsible for the appointment, retention (via proposals to the shareholders’ meeting) and oversight
of the work of TIM’s external auditors appointed to prepare and deliver the auditors’ report on the
annual financial statements;

- the Board of Statutory Auditors is authorised to appoint independent counsels and other advisers, as
it deems appropriate; and

- the Board of Statutory Auditors has adopted a complaints procedure in accordance with Rule 10A-3
of the 1934 Act.

In view of its responsibilities under Italian law and the obligations deriving from U.S. law, the Board of
Auditors has adopted a complaints procedure for receiving, retaining and treating the “reports” it receives.
Such reports can be of the following kinds:

- statements of violations submitted by shareholders concerning matters deemed to be improper;

- complaints by any person, thus including non-shareholders, concerning alleged irregularities,
improper facts or, more generally, any problem or issue deemed to merit investigation by the control
body;

- complaints specifically regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters; and

- confidential, possibly anonymous submissions of “concerns” by employees of TIM or the TIM
Group regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.

**Potential Conflicts of Interest**

Some of the Directors and Statutory Auditors of TIM, in addition to their functions in TIM, hold
management and/or supervisory functions in other companies and/or institutions (see “Directors”,
“Description of Directors’ Outside Interests” and “Board of Statutory Auditors”); namely, this is true for
Mr. De Puyfontaine, who is Chairman of the Management Board of Vivendi. Consequently, it cannot be
excluded that potential conflicts of interests may arise in the future, should any of these companies and/or
institutions enter into commercial or other types of transactions with TIM which are not at arms’ length and
within the ordinary course of business and/or are capable of influencing significantly the profits and losses,
assets and liabilities and financial situation of TIM or the TIM Group.


-----

As at the date of this Base Prospectus, there are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties to TIM
or its directors and executive officers and their private interests and/or duties.

**Italian taxation**

The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes. It is
based on the laws presently in force in Italy, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to
be, legal or tax advice. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations
which may be relevant to a decision to subscribe for, purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not
purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as
dealers in securities or commodities) may be subject to special rules. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are
advised to consult their own tax advisers concerning the overall tax consequences of their ownership of the
Notes, including the application to their particular situation of the tax considerations discussed below.

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws in force in Italy as of the date of this
EMTN Programme Prospectus and are subject to any changes in law occurring after such date, which
changes could be made on a retroactive basis.

**_Tax treatment of Notes issued by TIM_**

Decree No. 239 provides for the applicable regime with respect to the tax treatment of interest, premium and
other income (including the difference between the redemption amount and the issue price) from notes
falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) or debentures similar to bonds (titoli similari alle
_obbligazioni) issued, inter alia, by Italian listed companies._

_Italian resident Noteholders_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is (i) an individual not engaged in entrepreneurial activity to which the
Notes are connected (unless he has opted for the application of the “risparmio gestito” regime – see under
“Capital gains tax” below), (ii) a non-commercial partnership, (iii) a non-commercial private or public
institution, or (iv) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation, interest, premium and other
income relating to the Notes, accrued during the relevant holding period, are subject to a tax withheld at
source, referred to as imposta sostitutiva, levied at the rate of 26 per cent..

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from
the 26 per cent. _imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in_
entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June 1994
and Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10 February 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114)
of Law No. 232 of 11 December 2016 (Finance Act 2017).


-----

If the Noteholders described under (i) and (iii) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the
Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are
deposited with an authorised intermediary, interest, premium and other income from the Notes will not be
subject to _imposta sostitutiva but must be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are_
therefore subject to general Italian corporate taxation (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status
of Noteholder, also to regional tax on productive activities – IRAP).

Under the current regime provided by Law Decree No. 351 of 25 September 2001 converted into law with
amendments by Law No. 410 of 23 November 2001 (Decree No. 351), Article 32 of Law Decree No. 78 of
31 May 2010, converted into law with amendments by Law No. 122 of 30 July 2010, and Article 2(1)(c) of
Decree No. 239, all as amended, payments of interest, premiums or other proceeds in respect of the Notes
made to Italian resident real estate investment funds qualifying as such from a legal and regulatory
perspective are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate
investment fund, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26 per cent. will apply, in certain circumstances, to
income realised by unitholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units.

Pursuant to Article 9 of Legislative Decree No. 44 of 4 March 2014 (Decree No. 44), the same regime is
applicable to Italian real estate SICAFs qualified as such from a civil law perspective.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an open-ended or a closed-ended investment fund, a _Società di_
_Investimento a Capitale Fisso (SICAF) or a_ _Società di Investimento a Capitale Variabile (SICAV)_
established in Italy (together, the **Fund) and either (i) the Fund or (ii) its manager is subject to the**
supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an authorised intermediary, interest,
premium and other income accrued during the holding period on such Notes will not be subject to _imposta_
_sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund. The Fund will not be subject to_
taxation on such result, but a withholding tax of 26 per cent. will apply, in certain circumstances, to
distributions made in favour of unitholders or shareholders.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of
Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorised
intermediary, interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period
will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued
at the end of the tax period, which will be subject to a 20 per cent. substitute tax. Subject to certain
conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other
income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20 per cent. substitute tax if the
Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the
requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, _imposta sostitutiva_ is applied by banks, _società di intermediazione mobiliare_
(SIMs), fiduciary companies, _società di gestione del risparmio (SGRs), stockbrokers and other entities_
identified by a decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each an Intermediary).

An Intermediary must (i) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian
resident financial intermediary and (ii) intervene, in any way, in the collection of interest or in the transfer of
the Notes. For the purpose of the application of _imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any_
assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change of the ownership of
the relevant Notes or in a change of the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. Where the Notes
are not deposited with an Intermediary, _imposta sostitutiva_ is applied and withheld by any entity paying
interest to a Noteholder.


-----

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes
are effectively connected, an exemption from _imposta sostitutiva_ applies provided that the non-Italian
resident beneficial owner is either: (i) resident, for tax purposes, in a country which allows for a satisfactory
exchange of information with the Republic of Italy as listed in the Italian Ministerial Decree of 4 September
1996, as amended from time to time, or in any other decree to be issued in the future under the authority of
Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, as amended by Legislative Decree No. 147 of 14 September 2015 (the
**White List); or (ii) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which**
have entered into force in Italy; or (iii) a Central Bank or an entity which manages, _inter alia, the official_
reserves of a foreign State; or (iv) an institutional investor which is incorporated in a country included in the
White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own country of residence.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders without a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected must (i) be the beneficial owners of the payments of
interest, premium or other income, (ii) deposit the Notes with a resident bank or SIM, or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM or with a non-Italian resident entity or company
participating in a centralised securities management system which is in contact, via computer, with the
Ministry of Economy and Finance and (iii) file with the relevant depository, prior to or concurrently with the
deposit of the Notes, a statement of the relevant Noteholder, which remains valid until withdrawn or
revoked, in which the Noteholder declares to be eligible to benefit from the applicable exemption from the
_imposta sostitutiva. Such statement, which is not requested for international bodies or entities set up in_
accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy nor in case of foreign
Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State, must comply with
the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of 12 December 2001, as subsequently amended.

_Imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at the rate of 26 per cent. (or, in any case, at the reduced rate provided_
for by the applicable double tax treaty, if any) to interest paid to Noteholders who do not fall in any of the
above mentioned categories or do not timely and properly comply with the set procedural requirements.

**_Tax treatment of Notes issued by TI Finance_**

Decree No. 239 also provides for the applicable regime with respect to the tax treatment of interest, premium
and other income (including the difference between the redemption amount and the issue price) from notes
falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) or debentures similar to bonds (titoli similari alle
_obbligazioni) issued, inter alia, by non-Italian resident issuers._

_Italian resident Noteholders_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, an _imposta sostitutiva_ equal to 26 per cent. is applied on any payment of
interest, premium and other income accrued during the relevant holding period in respect of the Notes issued
by TI Finance if payments are made to (i) an Italian individual, (ii) an Italian non-commercial partnership,
(iii) an Italian non-commercial private or public institution, or (iv) an Italian investor exempt from Italian
corporate income taxation. If the Noteholders described under (i) and (iii) above are engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax.

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from
the 26 per cent. _imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals or social security_
entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10
February 1996 not engaged in entrepreneurial activity and the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114)
of Finance Act 2017.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected and the Notes are


-----

deposited with an authorised intermediary, interest, premium and other income from the Notes will not be
subject to _imposta sostitutiva but must be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are_
therefore subject to general Italian corporate taxation (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status
of Noteholder, also to IRAP).

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an Italian real estate investment fund or a real estate SICAF, a Fund
or a pension fund, the applicable tax treatment is the one described above under paragraph “Tax treatment of
_Notes issued by TIM — Italian resident Noteholders” with regard to the same categories of Noteholders._

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

No Italian _imposta sostitutiva_ is applied on payments to a non-Italian resident Noteholder of interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes issued by TI Finance provided that, if such Notes are held in
Italy, the non-Italian resident Noteholder declares itself to be non-Italian resident according to Italian tax
regulations.

_Payments made by an Italian resident guarantor_

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Italian resident Noteholders by an Italian resident guarantor,
in accordance with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any payment of liabilities equal to interest and other
proceeds from the Notes may be subject to a provisional withholding tax at a rate of 26 per cent. pursuant to
Presidential Decree No. 600 of 29 September 1973, as subsequently amended. In case of payments to nonItalian resident Noteholders, a final withholding tax may be applied at 26 per cent.. Double taxation treaties
entered into by Italy may apply allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate of withholding tax. In
accordance with another interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident guarantor will be
treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the relevant Issuer and will thus be subject to the tax
regime described in the previous paragraphs of this section.

**_Atypical securities_**

Interest payments relating to Notes that are not deemed to fall within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) or
debentures similar to bonds (titoli similari alle obbligazioni) may be subject to a withholding tax, levied at
the rate of 26 per cent.. For this purpose, debentures similar to bonds are securities that incorporate an
unconditional obligation to pay, at maturity, an amount not lower than their nominal value.

In the case of Notes issued by TIM, where the Noteholder is (i) an Italian individual engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, (ii) an Italian company or a similar Italian
commercial entity, (iii) a permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign entity to which the Notes are
effectively connected, (iv) an Italian commercial partnership or (v) an Italian commercial private or public
institution, such withholding tax is a provisional withholding tax. In all other cases, the withholding tax is a
final withholding tax. For non-Italian resident Noteholders, the withholding tax rate may be reduced under
the applicable tax treaty.

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from
the 26 per cent. _imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in_
entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June 1994
and Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10 February 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114)
of Finance Act 2017.

If the Notes are issued by a non-Italian resident Issuer, the withholding tax mentioned above does not apply
to interest payments made to a non-Italian resident Noteholder and to an Italian resident Noteholder which is
(i) a company or similar commercial entity (including the Italian permanent establishment of foreign
entities), (ii) a commercial partnership or (iii) a commercial private or public institution.


-----

**_Capital gains tax_**

_Italian resident Noteholders_

Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of the taxable income
(and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder, also as part of the net value of the
production for IRAP purposes) if realised by an Italian company or a similar commercial entity, including
the permanent establishment in Italy of foreign entities to which the Notes are effectively connected, or
Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is (i) an individual holding the Notes not in connection with an
entrepreneurial activity, (ii) a non-commercial partnership, (iii) a non-commercial private or public
institution, any capital gain realised by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be
subject to imposta sostitutiva, levied at the rate of 26 per cent.. Noteholders may set off losses with gains.

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital
gains realised upon sale or redemption of the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including
from the 26 per cent. imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in
entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of 30 June 1994
and Legislative Decree No. 103 of 10 February 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114)
of Finance Act 2017.

In respect of the application of imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt for one of the three regimes described
below.

a) “Regime della dichiarazione”. Under the tax declaration regime (regime della dichiarazione), which
is the default regime for Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above, imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will
be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains, net of any incurred capital loss, realised by
the Italian resident individual Noteholder holding the Notes not in connection with an
entrepreneurial activity pursuant to all sales or redemptions of the Notes carried out during any given
tax year. The relevant Noteholder must indicate the overall capital gains realised in any tax year, net
of any relevant incurred capital loss, in the annual tax return and pay _imposta sostitutiva_ on such
gains together with any balance income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital
gains may be carried forward against capital gains realised in any of the four succeeding tax years.
Pursuant to Law Decree No. 66 of 24 April 2014, converted with amendments into Law No. 89 of 23
June 2014 (Decree No. 66), capital losses realised from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2014 may be
carried forward to be offset against capital gains of the same nature realised after 30 June 2014 for
an overall amount of 76.92 per cent. of the capital losses.

b) “Regime del risparmio amministrato”. As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian
resident individual Noteholders under (i) to (iii) above may elect to pay the _imposta sostitutiva_
separately on capital gains realised on each sale or redemption of the Notes (the _risparmio_
_amministrato regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to (i) the Notes_
being deposited with Italian banks, SIMs or certain authorised financial intermediaries (including
permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) and (ii) an express election for the
_risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant Noteholder. The_
depository is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realised on
each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realised upon the
revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss, and is required to pay the relevant
amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the taxpayer, deducting a corresponding amount
from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for
this purpose. Under the _risparmio amministrato regime, where a sale or redemption of the Notes_
results in a capital loss, such loss may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realised, within
the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth.
Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains


-----

in the annual tax return. Pursuant to Decree No. 66, capital losses realised from 1 January 2012 to 30
June 2014 may be carried forward to be offset against capital gains of the same nature realised after
30 June 2014 for an overall amount of 76.92 per cent. of the capital losses.

c) “Regime del risparmio gestito”. Any capital gains realised by Italian Noteholder under (i) to (iii)
above who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an
authorised intermediary and have opted for the so-called risparmio gestito regime will be included in
the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realised,
at year end, subject to a 26 per cent. substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorised
intermediary. Under the _risparmio gestito regime, any decrease in value of the managed assets_
accrued at year end may be carried forward against increase in value of the managed assets accrued
in any of the four succeeding tax years. Under the risparmio gestito regime, the Noteholder is not
required to declare the capital gains realised in the annual tax return. Pursuant to Decree No. 66,
decreases in value of the managed assets registered from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2014 may be
carried forward to be offset against any subsequent increase in value accrued as of 1 July 2014 for an
overall amount of 76.92 per cent. of the decreases in value.

Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder that is an Italian real estate investment fund or any Italian real
estate SICAF to which the provisions of Decree No. 351 or Decree No. 44 as subsequently amended apply
will be subject neither to _imposta sostitutiva_ nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate
investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding tax or a substitute tax at the rate of 26 per
cent. will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realised by unitholders or shareholders in case of
distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares.

Any capital gains realised by an Italian Noteholder that is a Fund, a SICAF or a SICAV will not be subject to
_imposta sostitutiva, but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the_
relevant tax period. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but
income realised by unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or
shares, may be subject to a withholding tax of 26 per cent..

Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for
by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) will be included in the result of the
relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to the 20 per cent. substitute tax. Subject
to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the
Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20 per cent. substitute tax if the Notes are included in a
long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in
Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

Capital gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in Italy to
which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of Notes traded on regulated markets
are not subject to imposta sostitutiva.

Capital gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in Italy to
which the Notes are effectively connected, from the sale or redemption of the Notes not traded on regulated
markets are not subject to imposta sostitutiva provided that the beneficial owner (i) is resident for income tax
purposes in a country included in the White List; or (ii) is an international entity or body set up in accordance
with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (iii) is a Central Bank or an entity
which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State; or (iv) is an institutional investor which is
incorporated in a country included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its
own country of residence. If none of the conditions described above is met, capital gains realised by nonItalian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of the Notes not traded on regulated markets are
subject to imposta sostitutiva at the current rate of 26 per cent..


-----

In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double tax treaty with Italy providing that capital
gains realised upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of
the recipient, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realised upon the sale or
redemption of the Notes.

Gains realised by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by TI Finance
(whether or not traded on regulated markets) are not subject to Italian taxation, provided that the Notes are
held outside Italy.

**_Inheritance and gift taxes_**

The transfers of any valuable asset (including the Notes) as a result of death or donation (or other transfers
for no consideration) and the creation of liens on such assets for a specific purpose are taxed as follows:

(i) transfers in favour of the spouse and of direct descendants or ascendants are subject to an inheritance
and gift tax applied at a rate of 4 per cent. on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding
€1,000,000 (per beneficiary);

(ii) transfers in favour of the brothers or sisters are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate
of 6 per cent. on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding €100,000 (per beneficiary);

(iii) transfers in favour of all other relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives-in-law up to the third
degree, are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 6 per cent. on the entire value of
the inheritance or the gift; and

(iv) any other transfer is, in principle, subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 8 per cent.
on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

If the beneficiary of any such transfer is a disabled individual, whose handicap is recognised pursuant to Law
No. 104 of 5 February 1992, the tax is applied only on the value of the assets (including the Notes) received
in excess of € 1,500,000 at the rates illustrated above, depending on the type of relationship existing between
the deceased or donor and the beneficiary.

With respect to listed Notes, the value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is the average stock exchange
price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift (increased by the interest accrued
meanwhile). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is determined by
reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar features or based on other certain elements.

**_Wealth Tax on Financial Products Held Abroad_**

In accordance with Article 19 of Decree No. 201 of 6 December 2011, converted with Law No. 214 of 22
December 2011, Italian resident individuals holding financial products – including the Notes – outside of the
Italian territory are required to pay a wealth tax at the rate of 0.2 per cent. (the tax is determined in
proportion to the period of ownership). The tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year or
– in the lack of the market value – on the nominal value or redemption value of such financial products held
outside of the Italian territory. Taxpayers can generally deduct from the tax a tax credit equal to any wealth
taxes paid in the State where the financial products are held (up to the amount of the Italian wealth tax due).

**_Stamp taxes and duties_**

Pursuant to Article 13(2-ter) of the Tariff, Annex A, Part I, attached to Presidential Decree No. 642 of 26
October 1972, a proportional stamp duty applies on a yearly basis at the rate of 0.2 per cent. on the market
value or – in the lack of a market value – on the nominal value or the redemption amount of any financial
product (including the Notes). The stamp duty cannot exceed €14,000, for taxpayers different from
individuals. Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of


-----

Economy and Finance on 24 May 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in
the regulations issued by the Bank of Italy of 29 July 2009, as subsequently amended and restated) of an
entity that exercises in any form a banking, financial or insurance activity within the Italian territory.

**_Transfer tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows: (i) public deeds
and notarised deeds are subject to fixed registration tax at rate of €200; (ii) private deeds are subject to
registration tax only in case of use or voluntary registration.

**_Tax monitoring_**

Pursuant to Law Decree No. 167 of 28 June 1990, ratified and converted by Law No. 227 of 4 August 1990,
as amended, individuals, non-commercial partnerships and non-commercial entities which are resident of
Italy for tax purposes and which over the fiscal year hold or are beneficial owners of investments abroad or
have financial activities abroad must, in certain circumstances, disclose such investments or financial
activities to tax authorities in their income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper
form that must be filed within the same time as prescribed for the income tax return), regardless of the value
of such assets (save for deposits or bank accounts having an aggregate value not exceeding a € 15,000
threshold throughout the year, which per se do not require such disclosure). This requirement applies even if
the taxpayer during the tax period has totally divested such assets. No disclosure requirements exist for
investments and financial activities (including the Notes) under management or administration entrusted to
Italian resident intermediaries and for contracts concluded through their intervention, provided that the cash
flows and the income derived from such activities and contracts have been subject to Italian withholding or
substitute tax by intermediaries themselves.

**Luxembourg taxation**

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in
Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. The
information contained within this section is limited to Luxembourg withholding tax issues and prospective
investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisors as to the effect of state, local
or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding tax
or a tax of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.
Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur
_le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge_
(contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) generally.
Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or
taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to
most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally
subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an
individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking,
municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Withholding tax_**

Under Luxembourg tax law currently in effect and subject to the exception below, there is no Luxembourg
withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) in
respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the
Notes.

In accordance with the law of 23 December 2005, as amended (the **Law), payments of interest or similar**
income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner


-----

who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a 20 per cent. withholding tax. Such withholding tax will
be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the
management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for withholding such tax will be assumed by the
Luxembourg paying agent. Payment of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Law will be
subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

**_Income Taxation_**

**_(i)_** **_Luxembourg tax residency of the Noteholders_**

Noteholders will not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in Luxembourg solely by
reason of the holding, execution, performance, delivery, exchange and/or enforcement of the Notes.

**_(ii)_** **_Taxation of Luxembourg non-residents_**

Noteholders who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who do not have a permanent establishment, a
permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable are
not liable to pay any Luxembourg income tax, whether they receive payments of principal, payments of
interest (including accrued but unpaid interest), payments received upon the redemption, repurchase of the
Notes, or realise capital gains on the sale of any Notes.

Non-resident corporate Noteholders or individual Noteholders acting in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, who have a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg income tax on
interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains
realised upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

**_(iii)_** **_Taxation of Luxembourg residents_**

Noteholders who are residents of Luxembourg will not be liable for any Luxembourg income tax on
repayment of principal.

(a) Luxembourg resident individuals

Luxembourg resident individuals, acting in the course of the management of their private wealth, are subject
to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received unless the interest has been
subject (i) to withholding tax (see “Withholding tax” above) or (ii) to the self applied tax, if applicable.
Luxembourg resident individual Noteholders acting in the framework of the management of their private
wealth, can opt to self-declare and pay a 20 per cent. tax on interest payments made by paying agents located
in an EU Member State other than Luxembourg, or a Member State of the EEA other than an EU Member
State.

The withholding tax or self-applied tax are the final tax liability for the Luxembourg individual resident
taxpayers receiving the interest payment in the framework of their private wealth management. Luxembourg
resident individual Noteholders receiving interest as business income must include interest income in their
taxable basis. If applicable, the 20 per cent.. Luxembourg withholding tax levied will be credited against
their final income tax liability.

Luxembourg resident individual Noteholders are not subject to taxation on capital gains upon the disposal of
the Notes, unless the disposal of the Notes precedes the acquisition of the Notes or the Notes are disposed of
within six months of the date of their acquisition. Upon the sale, redemption or exchange of the Notes,
accrued but unpaid interest will be subject to the 20 per cent. withholding tax or the self-applied tax, if
applicable. Individual Luxembourg resident Noteholders receiving the interest as business income must
include the portion of the price corresponding to this interest in their taxable income. The 20 per cent.
Luxembourg withholding tax levied will be credited against their final income tax liability.


-----

(b) Luxembourg resident companies

Luxembourg resident corporate Noteholders must include in their taxable income any interest income
(including accrued but unpaid interest) and the difference between the sales price (including accrued but
unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

A corporate Noteholder that is governed by the law of 11 May 2007 on family estate management
companies, as amended, or by the law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as
amended, or by the law of 13 February 2007 on specialised investment funds, as amended, or by the law of
23 July 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (provided it is not foreseen in the incorporation
documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) Article 48 of the
aforementioned law of 23 July 2016 applies) is neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of
interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains realised on the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

**_Net wealth taxation_**

A corporate Noteholder, whether it is resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, it maintains a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which/whom such Notes are
attributable, is subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes, except if the Noteholder is governed by (i)
the law of 11 May 2007 on family estate management companies, as amended, or (ii) the law of 17
December 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended or (iii) the law of 13 February 2007
on specialised investment funds, as amended, or (iv) the law of 22 March 2004 on securitisation, as
amended, or (v) the law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as amended, or (vi) the law of 23 July
2016 on reserved alternative investment funds.[6]

An individual Noteholder, whether he/she is resident of Luxembourg or not, is not subject to Luxembourg
wealth tax on such Notes.

**_Other taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg
by Noteholders as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be payable as a
consequence of a subsequent transfer, repurchase or redemption of the Notes, unless the documents relating
to the Notes are voluntarily registered in Luxembourg or appended to a document that requires obligatory
registration in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issuance of
the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or of the transfer of the Notes.
Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain services
rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered or are deemed
to be rendered in Luxembourg and an exemption from Luxembourg value added tax does not apply with
respect to such services.

No gift, estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Notes upon death of a Noteholder in cases
where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes, or in the case of a gift,
the gift is neither recorded in a Luxembourg notarial deed nor registered in Luxembourg.

6 Please however note that securitisation companies governed by the law of 22 March 2004 on securitisation, as amended, or capital
companies governed by the law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as amended, or reserved alternative investment funds
governed by the law of 23 July 2016 and which fall under the special tax regime set out under Article 48 thereof may be subject to
minimum net wealth tax.

**Where a Noteholder is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the**
**Notes are included in his/her taxable estate of inheritance for tax assessment purposes.**

**The proposed European financial transactions tax (FTT)**

The European **Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium,**
Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia. In December
2015, Estonia withdrew from the group of states willing to introduce the FTT (the **Participating Member**
**States).**

The proposed FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions referred to
in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are exempt.

Under the current proposals, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside
of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least
one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A
financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a Participating Member State in a broad
range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member
State; or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating
Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and the
scope of any such tax is uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective
holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a
**foreign financial institution (as defined by FATCA) may be required to withhold on certain payments it**
makes (foreign passthru payments) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting or related
requirements. Telecom Italia Finance S.A. or TIM S.p.A. each may be a foreign financial institution for
these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including Italy and Luxembourg) have entered into, or have
agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (IGAs),
which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as
currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to
withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the
FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as Notes, are uncertain
and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with
respect to payments on instruments such as Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to 1 January 2019
and Notes issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining
foreign passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be grandfathered for
purposes of FATCA withholding, in either case unless materially modified after such date (including by
reason of a substitution of the relevant Issuer). However, if additional Notes that are not distinguishable
from previously issued Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and are subject to
withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all Notes, including the Notes offered prior to
the expiration of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult
their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in Notes. In the event any
withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no
person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.
