(a) QIBs, or

(b) not a U.S. person and are not located in the United States, its territories and possessions
(including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and the
Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United States or the District of Columbia (and if
you are in a Member State of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you are not
a retail investor (as defined for each of the EEA and the UK below)).

You are reminded that the following Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a
person into whose possession the following Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with


-----

the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the
following Offering Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the following Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation
of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation
or sale would be unlawful.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

THE FOLLOWING OFFERING MEMORANDUM HAS BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS THAT ANY
OFFER OF NOTES IN ANY MEMBER STATE OF THE EEA WILL BE MADE PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION UNDER THE PROSPECTUS REGULATION FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO PUBLISH A
PROSPECTUS FOR OFFERS OF NOTES. THE FOLLOWING OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS NOT A
PROSPECTUS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROSPECTUS REGULATION.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
No 2017/565, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended, “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as it forms part of UK domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

THE FOLLOWING OFFERING MEMORANDUM HAS BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS THAT ANY
OFFER OF NOTES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL BE MADE PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION
UNDER THE UK PROSPECTUS REGULATION AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT
2000 FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO PUBLISH A PROSPECTUS FOR OFFERS OF NOTES. THE
FOLLOWING OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS NOT A PROSPECTUS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE UK
PROSPECTUS REGULATION.

# Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc

**£1,644,688,000 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029**

**€469,981,000 Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2029**

Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc (the “Issuer”), a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, is offering
£1,644,688,000 aggregate principal amount of its 10.75% senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Offered **Sterling Notes”) and €469,981,000 aggregate**
principal amount of its floating rate senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Offered **Euro Notes” or “Euro Notes,” and, together with the Offered Sterling**
Notes, the “Offered **Notes”). In addition, on or about the Issue Date, the Issuer intends to issue £36,916,000 aggregate principal amount of its 10.75%**
senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Premium Sterling Notes”) to the Backstop Parties (as defined herein) as compensation for certain backstop
arrangements entered into in relation to the Issuance (as defined herein). The Offered Sterling Notes and the Premium Sterling Notes are hereinafter
referred to as “Sterling Notes,” and, the Offered Notes and the Premium Sterling Notes, are hereinafter referred to as “Notes.”

The Premium Sterling Notes will form part of the original issuance and will constitute a portion of the relevant series of the Sterling Notes. The Premium
Sterling Notes will have the same terms and conditions as the Offered Sterling Notes. The Premium Sterling Notes and the Offered Sterling Notes, will
form a single series and will, together with the Euro Notes and any Additional Notes (as defined herein), as applicable, be treated as single class of debt
securities under the Indenture (as defined herein), including with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. In addition, the
Premium Sterling Notes and the Offered Sterling Notes will have the same ISIN and common codes, and will be fully fungible with each other.

The Notes will mature on July 31, 2029, provided that if, on the date that is 90 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Existing PIK Facility (as
defined herein) (such date, the “Notes Springing Maturity Date”), the Existing PIK Facility has not been discharged in full, the maturity date shall be
the Notes Springing Maturity Date. The Issuer is a wholly-owned indirect finance subsidiary of Stonegate Pub Company Limited (the “Parent”), a
exempt company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes (the
“Issuance”), along with certain other sources, will be used to, among other things, redeem any and all outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Existing Notes (as defined herein). See “Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer will pay interest on the Sterling Notes semi-annually in arrears on each January 31 and July 31, commencing on January 31, 2025. The Issuer
shall pay interest on the Euro Notes quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November
15, 2024. The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes on or after July 31, 2026 at the redemption prices set out in this Offering Memorandum (the
“Offering Memorandum”), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to July 31, 2026, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a “make whole” premium, as described in
this Offering Memorandum. Prior to July 31, 2026, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the Sterling Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain
equity offerings at a price equal to 110.75% of the principal amount of the Sterling Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any; provided
that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes (not including any additional Sterling Notes) remains outstanding after
the redemption. In addition, prior to July 31, 2026, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the Euro Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity
offerings at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus (i) three-month EURIBOR relating to the interest period in which the notice of redemption
is delivered plus (ii) 6.625%, of the Euro Notes redeemed, along with accrued and unpaid interest, if any; provided that at least 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (not including any additional Euro Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption. The Issuer may
redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon the occurrence of
certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer may be required to offer to redeem the Notes
at 101% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred
if certain consolidated leverage ratios are not exceeded in connection with such an event.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank, equally in right of payment with all unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, senior
to all indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and effectively senior to all unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer
to the extent of the assets securing the Notes. On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Parent and
certain of its material subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The guarantee of the Notes by each Guarantor (a “Note Guarantee” and, collectively, the “Note
**Guarantees”), will rank equally in right of payment with all the existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor, senior to all the**
existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and effectively senior
to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the assets securing such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The Note
Guarantees will be, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.”
Upon their issuance and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable Security Documents (as defined herein) and Permitted Collateral Liens
(as defined herein), the Notes will be, secured by certain material assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The Collateral (as defined herein) also secure
obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement (as defined herein) and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements
(as defined herein) and any Operating Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) that are secured by assets that also secure obligations under
the Notes and the Note Guarantees, will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”)
for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and admission to trade on the Exchange. There
is no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. The Exchange is not a regulated market for purposes of MiFID II or
UK MiFIR (each as defined below).

**Investing in the Offered Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 31.**

_Issue price of the Offered Sterling Notes: 100% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date._
_Issue price of the Offered Euro Notes: 100% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date._

**Act”), or the securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Offered Notes are being offered and**

investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) on or about August 14,
2024.

**ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT CYCLE**

We expect that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about August 14, 2024,
which will be 10 business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein
referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act (as defined herein), trades in the secondary

otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under

(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information
document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as
amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them

recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market

Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the

certain jurisdictions, including statements under the captions “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry,” “Business” and in other_
sections. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology, such as the words “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,”
“will,” “plans,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “seek,” “should” or “would” or,
in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies, plans,
objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that
are not historical facts. They may appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and may
include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and dividend policy and the
industry in which we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements
are not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Offering Memorandum.

These factors include, among other things:

- changes in the general economic conditions in the UK;

- changes in consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to drinks and food;

- increase in consumers purchasing alcohol from supermarkets, off-licenses and other retailers;

- competition for consumers from other managed and tenanted pub operators, independent pubs, venues

- failure to realize appropriate return on the sale of our pub sites;

- risks and liabilities relating to past and future acquisitions;

- seasonality;

- risks relating to a significant real estate portfolio;

- risks relating to the inherently subjective nature and assumptions of property valuations;

- rent determination and review arrangements in lease and tenancy agreements which may lead to
decreased rent;

- our inability to control the operations of our Leased and Tenants pubs;

- credit risk with respect to publicans;

- compulsory purchase orders being made in respect of a property;

- negative publicity relating to one or more of our pubs or brands;

- further consolidation in our industry;

- climate change;

- disease outbreaks or incidents of food or drink contamination;

- loss of our key personnel;

- environmental compliance costs;

- increased costs to cover deficits in our pension schemes;

- liabilities that exceed or are not covered by our insurance;

- disruptions in our information technology systems;

- failure to maintain proper internal controls related to cash management;

- cybersecurity incidents;

- failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations;

- adverse litigation judgments;

- other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering
Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and
it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or
the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and we do not intend,
and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons
acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum. As a result,
you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

The market and competitive position data in the sections “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry” and “Business” of this Offering_
Memorandum are estimates by management based on industry publications, and from surveys or studies
conducted by third-party industry data providers that are generally believed to be reliable. However, the accuracy
and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and has not been independently verified. Additionally,
industry publications and such studies generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained
from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy or completeness of such information is not guaranteed and
in some instances the sources do not assume liability for such information. We have obtained certain of the market
and industry data presented in this Offering Memorandum from reports produced by third-party industry
specialists such as the British Beer and Pub Association (“BBPA”), CGA and Barclaycard, and we have obtained
consent from them as required to reproduce certain of their non-public data in this Offering Memorandum. We
cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such data, and we have not independently verified such
market data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment
decision. We do, however, accept responsibility for the correct reproduction of this information. We cannot assure
that market or industry forecasts will not be subject to change.

Some of the information herein has been extrapolated from such market data or reports using our experience and
internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the industry in which we
operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our experience, internal studies and estimates, and
our own investigation of market conditions. We believe that such information and statements are true and accurate,
but there can be no assurance that is the case. Such information and statements have not been verified by any
independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding such information, statements and
any similar data presented herein, such information, statements or similar data are subject to change based on
various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. As a
result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any
such information or statements in this Offering Memorandum.

Further, in this Offering Memorandum, we make statements about our market positioning relative to other pub
operators, and we also present comparative data of certain of our peer pub operators. These statements are
generally based on our experience, internal studies and estimates, and our own evaluation of our competitors in
the market. In general, we have identified our main competitors as the largest pub operators in the UK by number
of pubs. Where we present comparative data of certain of these peer pub operators, we have derived such data
from the publicly available information of these peer pub operators or industry publications, surveys or studies by
third-party data providers. We cannot guarantee that the comparative peer data that we present in this Offering
Memorandum has been prepared or presented on a comparable basis to our own key operating information. We
also cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such comparative peer data, and we have not
independently verified or reviewed such peer data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining
from making, any investment decision. Accordingly, the comparative peer data presented in this Offering
Memorandum should be treated with caution, as such information may not be directly comparable to our own key
operating information.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**IFRS Financial Information**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have presented our audited consolidated financial information as of and for the
52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and the 52 weeks ended September
24, 2023, which we have derived from the directors’ reports and financial statements for these periods prepared
by us. Our historical consolidated financial information mentioned above is presented in accordance with IFRS.
We have included our audited consolidated financial statements for these periods elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum but have not included the accompanying directors’ reports in this Offering Memorandum.

In this Offering Memorandum, we have also presented our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
information as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023 and April 7, 2024, which we have derived from our
non-statutory condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024,
which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our historical consolidated financial information
mentioned above is presented in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the UK.

Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, the 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022 and the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 which comprise the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity,
the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated cash flow statements and the related notes, were audited by
KPMG LLP, our independent auditors and KPMG LLP’s audit opinions for these periods are included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

In this Offering Memorandum, we have not included separate financial information for the Issuer. The Issuer was
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on July 9, 2019, as a wholly-owned indirect finance subsidiary
of the Parent, to facilitate the offering of debt securities. The Issuer has no business operations or material assets,
other than its rights under various intercompany loans made to other Group entities in relation to the proceeds of
financings from time to time.

Our financial year accounting periods run from the calendar day following the previous financial year end, which,
for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 were September 28, 2020, September 27, 2021 and September 26, 2022,
respectively, to the Sunday nearest to its accounting reference date. Accordingly, from time to time, our financial
year accounting period covers a 53-week period instead of a 52-week period. In addition, the results of operations
for prior years or interim periods may not be necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full-year
or any future period.

In addition, in this Offering Memorandum we have presented certain unaudited income statement information, as
well as certain of our other financial and operating information, for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024. Such
income statement information, as well as the other financial and operating information, for the 52 weeks ended
April 7, 2024 has been derived by adding the relevant item for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and for
the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, and subtracting the relevant item for the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023.

The consolidated financial information of the Group reflects the operating results and financial condition of the
Platinum Group, unless otherwise specified. The Platinum Group are Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Existing
Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement, and will be
designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. They will
therefore not be subject to the restrictive covenants of the Indenture governing the Notes. Unless otherwise
specified, all references to the Group are to the Company and its Subsidiaries (which, includes the Stonegate
Group and Platinum Group); all references to Stonegate Group are to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
(which excludes the Platinum Group); and all references to “we,” “us,” “our” are to the Group, unless otherwise
indicated or where the context otherwise requires.

**_Segment Reporting_**

Further to the acquisition of Ei Group (which we completed on March 3, 2020) and the integration of the Ei Group
business segments with our business, including the conversion of pubs into different operating models and formats
so as to enhance value creation and profitability, we introduced the following reportable segments from the period
commencing on July 4, 2021:

- Leased and Tenanted, in which we have no direct involvement in the operations and which consists of
(i) Pub Partnerships, covering rental income and revenue from supply of drinks and gaming machines

xv


-----

from our tied Pub Partners and (ii) commercial properties, covering rental income from our untied
commercial properties;

- Managed Pubs, in which we manage the site fully, taking on full operational risk and in return receiving
the full retail margin, and which consists of (i) the managed pubs operated by us and (ii) managed
investments operated pursuant to certain joint ventures entered into by us with experienced retail
partners; and

- Operator-run, in which we contract with a third party operator to manage the day-to-day operations of
the site, receiving a turnover-based fee. All labor costs are borne by the third party, but all other costs are
borne by us, and we have access to the full retail margin covering revenue from the sale of food, drink,
accommodation and gaming machine income. This segment consists of our Craft Union format.

Note 2 of our financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 included elsewhere in
this Offer Memorandum presents revenue, Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA and certain other metrics by reporting
segment. We eliminate intersegment revenues and costs upon consolidation and the segmental note is presented
net of these eliminations.

All of our revenue is generated in the UK and is not further segmented based on location. Therefore, no
geographical segmental analysis has been provided.

**_General_**

The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting
policies. Aspects involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where the assumptions and estimates
are significant to the consolidated financial information, are disclosed, to the extent applicable, in the notes to the
financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

We have not included financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP in this Offering
Memorandum. IFRS differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP. In making an investment decision,
you should rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering and the financial information contained
in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the
differences between IFRS and US GAAP, and how those differences could affect the financial information
contained in this Offering Memorandum.

References in this Offering Memorandum to “pound,” “pound sterling,” “UK pound” or “£” are to the lawful
currency of the UK. References in this Offering Memorandum to “euro” or “€” are to the single currency of the
participating member states of the EU participating in the third stage of economic and monetary union pursuant
to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, as amended or supplemented from time to time. The financial
information and financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum are presented in pound sterling.
Certain numerical figures included in this Offering Memorandum have been rounded. Discrepancies in tables
between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding.

**KPIs and other Non-IFRS and Pro Forma Financial Information**

In addition to IFRS financial information, we have presented in this Offering Memorandum certain KPIs and other
non-IFRS and pro forma measures that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance. See “Certain
_Definitions—Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Other Non-IFRS Metrics” and “Summary—Summary_
_Historical and Pro Forma Financial and other Information.” These KPIs and non-IFRS measures include, (a) in_
respect of the Group, Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Group Capital Expenditure (including Investment Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure and
Acquisition Capital Expenditure), Group Cash Conversion and Group Return on Investment and (b) in respect of
the Stonegate Group, Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA, Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Stonegate Group Capital Expenditure, Stonegate Group Cash Conversion, Stonegate Group Managed Revenue
Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Operator-Run Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group L&T
Revenue Growth (Like for Like) and Stonegate Group LTV Ratio.

The KPIs and other non-IFRS and pro forma financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is not
intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and have not been subject to review by the SEC.

xvi


-----

Such KPIs and other non-IFRS and pro forma financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools,
and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our position or results as reported
under IFRS. The KPIs and other non-IFRS and pro forma financial measures presented in this Offering
Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with
IFRS, US GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance
with any applicable auditing standards. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and
therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. Because not all companies
use identical calculations, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. See also “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—The adjustments to our Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA to derive our resulting_
_Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA should be treated with caution when making an investment_
_decision.”_

We have presented the KPIs and other non-IFRS and pro forma financial measures (i) as they are used by us to
monitor and report to the board on financial position and (ii) to present similar measures that are widely used by
certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of financial position,
financial performance and liquidity. We believe these measures enhance the investor’s understanding of our
indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet and service our
obligations.

In particular, we present (a) adjusted-EBITDA metrics, such as Group Adjusted EBITDA and Stonegate Group
Adjusted EBITDA, as they present a helpful measure of our profitability and operating performance under
normalized conditions by excluding certain exceptional or non-recurring income and expense items, (b) pro forma
adjusted-EBITDA metrics, such as Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as they present a helpful
measure of our profitability and operating performance for business planning purposes, by adjusting the impact
on our adjusted EBITDA for certain post-facto events and business initiatives, (c) EBITDA-margin metrics, such
as Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Stonegate Group Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as they present a helpful metric to discuss the proportion of our revenue that is
converted into operating profitability, (d) the cash conversion metrics such as Group Cash Conversion and
Stonegate Group Cash Conversion, as they present a helpful metric to discuss the proportion of our adjusted
EBITDA that readily converts to cash as we manage our Maintenance Capital Expenditure spend and (e) like-forlike metrics, such as Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Operator-Run
Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like), as they enable
discussion on comparative operating performance of our pubs in each of our three segments. See also “—
_Stonegate Group KPIs and other Non-IFRS and Pro Forma Financial Information.”_

Where we present Group Return on Investment in this Offering Memorandum, we have not included in the
calculation the results of pubs that have traded for fewer than 52 weeks post-investment. Had we included the
results of our pubs which have been invested in but have not yet traded for the 52 weeks post-investment, Group
Return on Investment that we have presented for each period shown in this Offering Memorandum would likely
have been higher.

We have presented the KPIs and other non-IFRS and pro forma financial information in this Offering
Memorandum because our management believes they are useful as additional tools to measure our operating
performance, the profitability of our operations, financial information and cash flow, and because we believe that
these figures are commonly reported and widely used by investors.

**_Stonegate Group KPIs and other Stonegate Group Non-IFRS and Pro Forma Financial Information_**

On January 26, 2024, we completed the Platinum Transactions, pursuant to which we transferred 1,034 Leased
and Tenanted pubs (the “Platinum Pubs”) to the Platinum Group, which was designated as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries, among others, under the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Existing
Second Lien Facility Agreement, and will be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and the
Second Lien Facilities Agreement. See “Summary—Platinum Transactions.” The Stonegate Group metrics
presented in this Offering Memorandum have been calculated by excluding the operating results of the 1,034
Platinum Pubs, assuming that the Platinum Transactions were completed at the beginning of the relevant period
for which such metrics are presented in this Offering Memorandum.

We present the Stonegate Group metrics in this Offering Memorandum as the Notes shall be guaranteed by
Stonegate Group entities only and the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement
apply to Stonegate Group only. We believe these Stonegate Group metrics enhance the investor’s understanding

xvii


-----

of Stonegate Group and its ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet and service
its obligations under the Notes. The Stonegate Group metrics presented in this Offering Memorandum have not
been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. Such
figures may not have been prepared on the same basis as the Group figures and therefore investors should not
place undue reliance on such figures.

Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Operator-Run Revenue Growth
(Like for Like), Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like) for each period are presented only for
those pubs that were open and operated by us in one of our groups during the period presented and the previous
comparable period. Accordingly, not every pub that is trading during a period for which we present one of these
measures is included in the result presented for that period. For example, for the 52 weeks ended September 24,
2023, 397 of our pubs were not included in the calculation of these measures.

**_Important Notice Relating to the Unaudited Pro forma Information Presented in this Offering Memorandum_**

In addition, we also present in this Offering Memorandum certain pro forma and other adjusted financial
information, including Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt, Stonegate Group Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt,
Stonegate Group Adjusted Cash Interest Expense and various leverage coverage and loan to value ratios. These
measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as
alternative measures to evaluate our performance. For the adjustments, assumptions and other details in relation
to these pro forma and adjusted financial information, See “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and
_Other Information.”_

The Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum has not been
prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, and does not purport to represent what our
results of operations would have been, nor do they purport to project the results of operations for any future period.
Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as used in this Offering Memorandum may not be calculated in
the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“Description of the Notes” or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Business—The adjustments to our Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA to derive our resulting Stonegate_
_Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA should be treated with caution when making an investment decision.”_

Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt, Stonegate Group Adjusted Cash Interest Expense and Stonegate Group
Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt presented below provide information on an “adjusted” basis to give effect
to the Transactions, as if they had been completed on April 10, 2023. Such unaudited adjusted financial
information presented in this Offering Memorandum do not purport to represent what our actual net debt and lease
adjusted net debt would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on April 10, 2023, or what our actual
cash interest expense would have been had the Transactions actually occurred, and our debt as of April 7, 2024
actually incurred, on April 10, 2023, and nor do they purport to represent these metrics as of or for any future date
or for any future period.

The Avison Young Valuation Reports have been prepared in accordance with the definition of “Market Value”
consistent with the RICS Standards. The reports note that Avison Young’s valuation took into account the trading
and property data provided by management. For tenanted properties, it considered the net rent, barrelage and
machine income to arrive at the fair maintainable income which is then capitalized to appraise market value. For

_below does not contain all the information that you should consider before investing in the Offered Notes. You_
_should read the entire Offering Memorandum carefully, including the “Risk Factors” section and our financial_
_statements and the notes thereto, before making an investment decision. In addition, certain statements include_
_forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements.” Unless_
_otherwise specified, all references to the Group are to the Company and its Subsidiaries (which, includes the_
_Stonegate Group and Platinum Group); all references to Stonegate Group are to the Company and its Restricted_
_Subsidiaries (which excludes the Platinum Group); and all references to “we,” “us,” “our” are to the Group,_
_unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires._

**Overview**

We are the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites (4,414 Group sites and 3,380
Stonegate Group sites, as of April 7, 2024). We began our trading operations in November 2010 with the
acquisition of 333 pubs from Mitchells & Butlers and, through a series of strategic acquisitions, including the Ei
Acquisition, we are now the largest pub company in the United Kingdom. Since 2010, we have acquired
businesses and assets in order to geographically diversify our presence across the United Kingdom, providing
exposure to regional markets and a number of operating models, formats and brands that provide a diverse and
resilient financial profile. We continually evaluate opportunities to strategically acquire individual sites in
situations where those sites are a particularly good fit for our existing business.

We have a strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties, approximately 81%
by number of Group sites and approximately 90% by value (as of September 24, 2023) and a Group property asset
value of £4.1 billion (as of September 24, 2023). Within Stonegate Group, which has a property asset value of
£3.2 billion (as of September 24, 2023), our freehold estate comprises approximately 76% by number of sites and
approximately 88% by value, in each case as of September 24, 2023. We have a strong presence in London and
the southeast region of the United Kingdom and have diverse operating models, formats and brands.

Our revenue is generated from a variety of sources, including drink sales (76.7% and 77.2% of our Group’s
consolidated revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024) and food
sales (10.4% and 9.8% of our Group’s consolidated revenue in the same periods). We believe that our diverse,
resilient and agile business across operating models, formats and brands, led by our experienced and reputed
management team, is instrumental in driving our revenue growth. Our Group’s revenue, operating profit, and loss
after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 were £1,719 million, £68 million
and £155 million, respectively, and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 it was £916 million, £190 million and
£4 million. Stonegate Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 was £1,594 million and Stonegate
Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 would have been £411.6 million.

The pubs and bars sector in the UK experienced significant disruption due to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic and the subsequent government intervention, which resulted in the temporary closure of pubs and bars,
severely impacted trading in 2020 and 2021. However, according to CGA, the pubs and bars sector in the UK has,
in the year ended December 31, 2023, recovered to similar levels as measured by sales as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with pub companies experiencing particularly strong
trading in the past 12 months.

We operate three main business segments: Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run:

  - _Leased and Tenanted: Within our Leased and Tenanted segment, Pub Partnership is our principal_
business activity following the completion of the Ei Acquisition. In addition, this segment also includes
commercial properties which consist of free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties that are operated and
managed by third-party leaseholders on arms-length agreements. A key feature of the Pub Partnership
operating model is the tie arrangement, whereby most Pub Partners have agreed under their lease or
tenancy agreements to purchase beer and other beverages through us. The tie arrangements, along with
rental income, provide us with resilient and recurring earnings. As of April 7, 2024, the Group has 3,019
Leased and Tenanted pubs, which includes 1,985 Leased and Tenanted pubs in the Stonegate Group with
the remaining 1,034 pubs in the Platinum Group.

1


-----

  - _Managed Pubs: Our Managed pubs are owned and operated by us and derive their income predominantly_
from the retail sale of food and drinks, accommodation and gaming machines. We believe this segment
allows us to take advantage of the pubs we believe have a significant upside potential through direct
management by experienced pub managers and pub operators. Our Managed pubs are strategically
positioned to cater to different customer demographics, trends and occasions. Our Managed pubs are
classified into nine formats, Bars & Venues, Be At One, Popworld, Premium, Proper Pubs, Pub & Dining,
Slug & Lettuce, Social Pub & Kitchen and Sports Bar & Grill. In addition, within our Managed Pubs
business segment, we also have entered into 48 joint ventures with experienced retail partners. As of
April 7, 2024, we had 803 pubs operating within our Managed segment, all within the Stonegate Group.

  - _Operator-run Pubs: The Operator-run pubs are run by self-employed operators under our guidelines for_
managed pub operations, with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but typically a limited
food offering. The self-employed operator is paid a fixed percentage of revenue and is responsible for
employing all of the on-site staff. Accordingly, we benefit from low levels of operational gearing,
resulting in resilient earnings, downside protection and proportionally lower central costs to operate
Operator-run pubs. We operate these pubs under the Craft Union format, with one clear retail offer that
is drinks-led with quality beers at affordable prices, served in local, well-invested facilities, with audio
visual equipment for sports and entertainment. We believe that the structure of the Operator-run model
supports superior return on capital investment, as well as provides for higher levels of downside
protection given that we retain all revenue and meet all costs (other than staff costs, which are paid by a
self-employed operator who receives a percentage of revenue in order to do so). As of April 7, 2024, we
had 584 pubs operating within our Operator-run segment, all within the Stonegate Group.

**Our Strengths**

Our key credit strengths include the following:

**_Attractive and stable market, growing with a shrinking pub footprint_**

Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK pubs and bars market demonstrated stable long-term
growth, increasing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.0% between 2015 and 2019 to reach a
total industry revenue level of approximately £29.5 billion in 2019. Following two years of disrupted business
and operations due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK pubs and bars market recovered to preCOVID- 19 levels in 2022, and CGA forecasts growth in the sector to be approximately 2.8% during the period
from 2023 to 2029. We expect that this stable market growth, coupled with a continued reduction in the number
of establishments in the sector, to be beneficial to the remaining establishments such as the Group.

We believe that we are also well-placed to benefit from the supportive supply-demand dynamics in both the
“drink-led” (or “wet”) and “food-led” (or “dry”) segments of the on-trade market (i.e. consumer businesses that
hold a license to sell alcohol on the premises). As shown below, the number of sites in the UK has declined from
2015 to 2023 by approximately 8,400 sites, with the decline in pubs and bars exacerbated during the COVID-19
impacted period. On the other hand, over the same period, the pubs and bars wet and dry market value has increased
by approximately £4.4 billion, thereby increasing the effective revenue per site by approximately £203,000 from
£509,000 in 2015 to £712,000 in 2023. According to CGA, the effective revenue per site is estimated to further
increase by 27% to £907,000 from 2023 to 2029.

The UK pubs and bars market has experienced downward trending wet volumes, impacted by the change in
alcohol consumption between different generations. According to the NHS health survey, alcohol consumption
has fallen among younger generations by approximately 15-22% from 2011 to 2021, although this has been
partially offset by an increase in alcohol consumption by older generations of approximately 5-11%. CGA
estimates that wet volumes during the period between 2023 and 2029 will remain relatively stable. However, as
a consequence of a declining number of sites, wet volumes per establishment are expected to increase at 10%
to 49 kL in 2029.

**_UK’s largest pub company benefitting from economies of scale_**

We have a high-quality and sustainable pub and bar estate. The quality of our estate is evident in our geographic
distribution and overall profile of our pubs. Our pubs are favorably weighted towards more suburban and rural
areas as well as towards London and areas in the southeast region of the United Kingdom. Additionally, our pubs
have diverse operating models, formats and brands, which we believe provides higher rental income and higher
drink sales based on a higher volume.

Our position as the United Kingdom’s largest pub company affords the business significant benefits of scale in
comparison to smaller pub companies in the United Kingdom. In terms of negotiating procurement terms, we
benefit from enhanced bargaining power with suppliers and service providers as a result of our size and
purchasing volume. In terms of operating leverage, we have higher revenue potential as our portfolio absorbs
the fixed costs associated with a pub company more effectively. Our operational expertise is a key benefit of
our scale, as it allows us to disseminate operational best practices across our estate to increase profitability, as
well as to access substantial data to inform key decisions such as strategic pricing and promotional initiatives.
Additionally, the size of our estate creates significant headroom for operational improvement across our portfolio
and value accretive capital opportunities, including the ability to convert and carry out expansionary
refurbishment, and the breadth of our portfolio allows for an efficient allocation of resources, where investment
is directed towards the highest returning opportunities.

Our diversification and significant scale position us to compete more effectively than other market participants,
delivering greater value to our stakeholders, including tenants, employees, customers and local communities.

**_Proven platform with a resilient, multi-offering business model_**

Our business is divided across three reporting segments, acting as a landlord for the Leased and Tenanted segment,
a proprietary pub operator for the Managed Pubs segment and a partner for third party operators for the Operatorrun segment.

As we are flexible in applying the format best suited to the demographic trends or customer base of a certain area,
we are able to overlay the appropriate brands and formats across our portfolio to maximize the performance of
our estate. Our multiple formats allow us to maintain a significant presence in growing cities without adversely
affecting sales at our pubs in adjacent locations, as compared to single-format operators that are limited to catering
to select target groups. Thanks to our multiple formats, we are also able to target a wide customer demographic
while being able to cater to various consumer trends.

Our multi-format platform brings diversity in terms of income sources (rental income, wholesale drink sales
and retail drink and food sales), locations (distribution throughout the United Kingdom with a weighting in


4


-----

more profitable areas such as London and the southeast region of the United Kingdom), operating models
(Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run).

**_High-quality and primarily freehold real estate portfolio_**

Our Group has a strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties,
approximately 81% by number of sites and approximately 90% (as of September 24, 2023) and a property asset
value of approximately £4.1 billion (as of September 24, 2023).

The estate is weighted towards rural and suburban locations, and the majority of its holdings also benefit from
being in the southern region of England, with approximately 53% of the Group’s estate as of September 24,
2023 located in that region where property prices are generally higher than the rest of the United Kingdom. Our
portfolio is well invested in with significant levels of capital expenditure, with a spend of £144 million, £140
million, £53 million on Capital Expenditure in the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022 and 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, respectively.

Our Group has a strong track record of disposing of properties above book value and from September 28, 2020
to April 7, 2024, has disposed of 290 sites at, on average, a 23.6% premium to book value. This continues the
pre- acquisition track record of the Ei Group, who, in the ten financial years ending on September 30, 2019,
disposed of 3,371 properties at a premium to book value of 19.9%.

**_Highly experienced, best-in-class management team_**

We have a highly experienced and stable senior management team, with significant relevant experience and
complementary skill sets in the retail, leisure and service sectors. Our board of directors is comprised of David
McDowall (Chief Executive Officer), David Ross (Chief Financial Officer), Brian Magnus (Senior Partner at
TDR Capital), Hassan Adel ElGazzar (Partner at TDR Capital) and Mark Davies (Non-Executive Director).

Our Group is led by our Chief Executive Officer, David McDowall, who has over 25 years of experience in the
retail and hospitality sector. Prior to joining us in January 2023, David was at the innovative brewer and bar
operator BrewDog, first as chief executive officer of the bars business, before holding a wider role as the
president and chief operating officer, overseeing the strategic direction and day-to-day operations of the business
in the United Kingdom and internationally. Prior to BrewDog, David was the group operations director at G1
Group, a leading Scottish hospitality operator. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Ross, has served in that capacity
since January 2012 and has over 20 years of experience in the retail industry. David qualified as a chartered
accountant with PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 1999, and before joining us, had held various senior roles at Boots,
Spirit Group, Laurel Pub Company, Bay Restaurant Group and Town and City Pub Group. Mark Davies has
joined us as a non-executive Director in June 2024. Mark is currently the chief executive officer of Primary
Healthcare Properties, a FTSE 250 UK real estate investment trust, and a non-executive director of Palace
Capital, a regional focused REIT. Mark was previously a co-founder and chief executive officer of NewRiver
REIT and Hawthorn Community Pub Company, which was sold to Admiral Taverns in 2021. Our management,
who we believe are the architects of the managed business model in the United Kingdom, have the knowledge,
skill set and experience required to run the largest pub company in the United Kingdom.

Our Group continues to have strong sponsor backing from TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm with over
€15 billion of assets under management. In July 2020, TDR Capital contributed equity of £50 million to support
the business in light of the challenges presented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that TDR Capital’s
active support, combined with the depth of our management’s industry experience, provides for efficient
decision-making and insightful leadership for our Group.

**Our Strategies**

As the business has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and is now operating in a steady
state, we intend to pursue the strategies set out below to take advantage of the attractive supply and demand
market dynamics.

**_Business as usual_**

 - _Leased and Tenanted: Within our Leased and Tenanted segment, we plan to operate the Pub_
Partnership business, our main business, in its existing form. We believe that the estate is of high
quality, having been shaped into a strong and profitable business by strategically disposing of

5


-----

underperforming, smaller and secondary assets over time. We intend to continue to invest in the
Leased and Tenanted portfolio to ensure that our Pub Partners have the infrastructure that they require
to provide the best customer experience and to increase site profitability, ensuring the resilience of our
income.

 - _Managed Pubs: Our strategy for the Managed Pubs business includes continued capital investments,_
responsiveness to industry trends, pricing improvements, labor efficiency and the implementation of
operational best practices across our estate.

 - _Operator-run: We continue to leverage our Managed Pub expertise in our Operator-run estate,_
combining best practice from Managed Pubs in a format where there is limited operational gearing.
We will continue to be innovative with the formats deployed, focusing primarily on the proven Craft
Union format.

**_Asset optimization strategy_**

We intend to maintain our commitment to asset optimization through capital investment and to capital recycling
through disposals, as we continue to improve our business performance and further increase our market share.
We have a sizeable pipeline of opportunities in our portfolio, which provides for strong investment and growth
opportunities in the future. Our commitments will be primarily focused on conversions to the Operator- run
model where we can use our flexibility and innovation in ensuring the most suitable format is implemented, in
particular, on converting the majority of applicable pubs to our Craft Union format.

We expect that our capital program going forward will be weighted towards pubs in suburban locations in order
to maximize our returns in the current trading environment. However, the scale of our potential pipeline allows
us to be flexible when selecting investment opportunities and we will remain alert to any changes in underlying
consumer trends and adjust our capital investment strategy accordingly, to the extent necessary. We intend to
capitalize on our ability to deliver market-leading operating performance across the Leased and Tenanted,
Managed Pubs and Operator-run models, particularly in light of the value creation opportunities provided by the
low operating leverage inherent in the Operator-run model. These strategies are discussed in more detail below.

Supported by our established asset management function, assuming a steady state of business and in line with
our strategy to invest in value enhancing operating models, we currently expect to convert approximately 50
pubs a year over the next 6 years from the Leased and Tenanted segment to mainly the Operator-run and a few
to the Managed Pubs segment. We have been historically successfully in converting our pubs between operating
format, with a historical record of approximately 40% return on investment for conversions during the 156
weeks ended April 7, 2024.

_Expand the Operator-run model to capture retail economics_

We believe we can create value by improving the existing Craft Union pubs and converting suitable Leased and
Tenanted pubs into the Craft Union format. We estimate that we will invest, on average, approximately £150,000
to £200,000 per pub to convert Leased and Tenanted pubs into Operator-run pubs, with high performing Leased
and Tenanted sites selected for this conversion, which benefits from the labor cost arbitrage of the tenanted
model and allows for greater control of investment, format and operations. The conversion allows us to capture
the full retail margin on food and drink sales, whilst minimizing exposure to labor costs. This would allow us
to capture Operator-run retail economics, in which we are targeting an estimated return on investment of
approximately 41% as illustrated in the chart below.

**Illustrative Economics – Leased and Tenanted to Operator-run**


_Note: Illustrative example shows average to the nearest £5,000 from management’s estimated profit and loss for typical pubs post_
_conversion, although at the individual pubs level, a range around this average level is generally expected. References to “EBITDA” in the_
_illustration above are to pre-adjusted EBITDA._

As illustrated above, to achieve a pre-adjusted EBITDA uplift of approximately £80,000 per pub, on conversion,
we believe we can benefit from approximately £450,000 of captured retail economics of the Operator-run format,
and enhancing revenue potential through optimal bar management. This is then offset by increased labor and pubs
costs of approximately £260,000, together with the forgone rent and operator fees of approximately £110,000.

Operator-run pubs are run by self-employed operators who receive a fixed percentage of the revenue generated
at these pubs and are responsible for organizing and paying staff. This operating model provides the benefits of
a Managed Pub model, in terms of control over investments, formats and operations (e.g., in areas of pricing and
marketing), together with the capture of retail economics, while also providing certain benefits of the Leased
and Tenanted model, in terms of allocating responsibility to the pub operator for labor, staffing and other costs.
These pubs tend to be drink-led with no food offering and have a sports focus. We believe that the Craft Union
format is particularly well suited for drink-led pubs with lower revenues.

_Conversions from Leased and Tenanted to Managed Pubs_

We expect to convert a number of Leased and Tenanted pubs into Managed Pubs. Our Leased and Tenanted
estate provides a large pipeline for these conversions and we currently expect to convert approximately 5 pubs
a year from Leased and Tenanted to Managed Pubs.

We generally expect these conversions to result in higher profitability. Above a minimum level of sales,
Managed Pubs typically generate incremental profit on a unit basis when compared to a Leased and Tenanted
pub by capturing profit that would otherwise have been retained by tied publicans in the Leased and Tenanted
model. Additionally, through our capital investments program, whereby we estimate we will invest, on average,
approximately £300,000 to £350,000 per pub to implement these conversions, we are targeting an estimated
return on investment of approximately 20% as illustrated in the chart below.

As illustrated above, to achieve pre-adjusted EBITDA uplift of approximately £160,000 per pub, on conversion,

£800,000, together with foregone rent of approximately £35,000.

_Conversions from Managed Pubs to Operator-run_

We expect to convert a number of Managed pubs into Operator-run pubs. We generally expect these conversions to
result in higher profitability by realizing the opportunity to capture cost savings from Managed pubs with low average
weekly take (“AWT”) and limited food sales, while retaining the full margin on drinks sales. We consider Managed
pubs generating approximately £10,000 to £12,000 in AWT, of which approximately £1,000 is related to food sales,
to be low in AWT. Additionally, through our capital investments program, whereby we estimate we will invest, on
average, approximately £50,000 to £100,000 per pub to implement these conversions, we are targeting an estimated
return on investment of approximately 35% as illustrated in the chart below.

_although at the individual pubs level, a range around this average level is generally expected. References to “EBITDA” in the illustration above_
_are to pre-adjusted EBITDA._

As illustrated above, to achieve pre-adjusted EBITDA uplift of approximately £110,000 per pub, on conversion, we
benefit from approximately £305,000 of labor cost savings and £235,000 of wider pub cost savings. This is then
offset by operator fees of approximately £90,000 and reduced retail economics of approximately £340,000.

_Expansions_

In addition to the conversions, an important aspect of our asset optimization strategy going forward is
concentrated on investing in the refurbishment and upgrading of assets in the existing estate. The strategy
includes each of the Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run segments, with a total of
approximately 300 to 400 sites a year, at a cost of approximately £30 to £40 million each year.

The strategy is predominantly focused on the Leased and Tenanted estate, targeting approximately 250 planned
expansions a year over the next 6 years, with management intending on accelerating its investment into the
Leased and Tenanted division beginning in the 2025 financial year. During the 156 weeks ended April 7, 2024,
expansion schemes in the Leased and Tenanted segment have delivered approximately 68% return on investment. The
average expenditure for the planned expansions is approximately £30,000 per Leased and Tenanted site until
2029 (with an annual increase in line with 2.5% inflation). Additionally, we are planning on targeting
approximately 100 Operator-run or Managed Pubs expansions a year over the next 6 years.

_Disposals_

Disposals are a key pillar of our asset optimization strategy. In addition to planned sale-and-leaseback of selected
Managed Pubs sites, we aim to opportunistically crystallize value through selective site disposals, which
predominantly consist of sites that are no longer core to our conversions or expansions strategy.

The disposal strategy contributes to our business strategic objectives of deleveraging, funding growth capital
expenditure and providing an opportunity to crystalize value at attractive multiples. From September 28, 2020
to April 7, 2024, we have received a total of £158.4 million in disposal proceeds, with a total of 290 sites disposed
of at run-rate multiples of 22.7x.

**_Continuous Optimization Initiatives of Business Operations_**

We continuously focus on delivering optimization through a number of business initiatives outlined below.

8


-----

_Pricing_

Pricing is a key component of ensuring we continue to improve our margins, which has been particularly key to
our overall strategic objectives given the inflationary environment in the United Kingdom in the last 2 years, with
Consumer Price Index inflation reaching a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Our current pricing strategy focuses
on offsetting cost inflation by raising prices via data-led strategic increases in our Managed Pubs and Operatorrun segments and maximizing price levers within the Leased and Tenanted segment.

For the Operator-run segment, we believe our pricing is currently below our peers’ pricing. Therefore, in the
near term, we are planning on capitalizing on price headroom to deliver strong price increases during the second
half of 2024, alongside a longer-term strategy to increase prices marginally ahead of inflation. For the Managed
Pubs segment, the higher-end positioning of the Managed Pubs business enables longer-term price increases
above inflation, driven by premiumization trends. For our Leased and Tenanted business, price increases are
implemented through yearly price reviews in April and are limited to CPI inflation plus 3%. Additionally, the
pricing of the rental component of the Leased and Tenanted income is supported by predominantly index linked
tenancy agreements, which implement rent increases with inflation.

_Media_

We realize the potential for use of digitalization and technology to enhance our Group’s performance and
improve our margins. Our media strategy is focused on two key initiatives, first, the “Media” initiative, which
involves the installation of digital advertising screens at our Managed sites, and second, the MiXR App, which
is a cross portfolio loyalty application that engages customers across multiple brands.

The Media component of our strategy involves installing of digital advertising screens to exhibit promotional
content at Managed sites. We aim to have installed digital advertising screens at approximately 800 selected
sites by November 2024. The screens will feature premium brands to enhance the increasing trend of
premiumization among our customers, whereby customer demand for premium drink categories has been
growing, particularly for premium lager and craft beer. The screens will also provide additional revenue from
third-party advertising media sales and content.

The MiXR App is a newly launched loyalty application designed to encourage customers to pre-book visits to
pubs in our estate, as well as display our promotional initiatives. The application has been popular since its release,
with downloads continuing to perform ahead of the rate required to achieve our target of 1.5 million downloads by
September 2024. The MiXR App is designed to increase customer loyalty to our pub estate and increase the
frequency of visits by customers.

_Cost Rationalization_

We continue to focus on improving our margins, of which cost rationalization is a key part of the wider strategy.
Significant progress has been made towards the operational improvement of our business, in particular, cost
rationalization in our head office functions, in addition to further initiatives in place to support long-term
strategic initiatives. As part of our cost rationalization strategy, we are also focused on simplifying our overall
structure, including increased spans of control, automation of processes where applicable and cost reductions.

_Energy_

Wholesale energy prices increased rapidly from the second half of 2021 and into 2023 as a consequence of a
supply-demand imbalance, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Following this period of
volatile and elevated energy costs, we have taken steps to reduce energy consumption and otherwise mitigate
the impact of energy price volatility across our estate. There was a spike in prices during December 2022, but
prices fell back in early 2023 and have remained at levels well below their 2022 peak. However, they still remain
above their pre ‘energy crisis’ levels.

The pricing component of the energy strategy is focused on hedging energy prices to mitigate the impact of
volatility in future energy prices, with the Group hedging almost 100% and 75% of our expected electricity usage
for summer and winter 2024 and 98% and 78% of our expected gas usage for summer and winter 2024.
Additionally, to reduce consumption, we conduct periodic trainings and communication initiatives for our staff to
support reduced energy consumption.

**Current Trading**

Based on our preliminary financial results for the twelve weeks ended June 30, 2024, we believe our business is
continuing to perform in line with expectations and in accordance with historical trends. Our preliminary financial
results indicate that during the twelve weeks ended June 30, 2024, our revenue across all three segments was
approximately £406 million, primarily as a result of revenue growth in the Operator-run segment being offset by
decrease in revenue in our Managed Pubs segment and Leased and Tenanted segment. Based on our preliminary
financial results, our revenue for the forty weeks ended June 30, 2024 was approximately £1,318 million, primarily
driven by strong performance in the Operator-run segment, whereas our revenue from the Managed Pubs segment
increased marginally and our revenue from Leased and Tenanted segment decreased marginally. Based on our
preliminary financial results, we estimate that our pre-adjusted EBITDA for the twelve weeks ended June 30,
2024 was approximately £94 million. Based on our preliminary financial results, we also estimate that our Group’s
pre-adjusted EBITDA for the forty weeks ended June 30, 2024 was approximately £290 million.

We believe that we are also off to a strong start entering the fourth quarter ending September 29, 2024. In the first
week ended July 7, 2024, our sales in the Managed Pubs and Operator-run segments were approximately £17
million and £6 million, respectively, up by 3.4% and 8.4% on a like-for-like basis. In the week ended July 14,
2024, we saw increases in sales, with approximately £20 million in sales for Managed pubs and approximately £7
million in sales for Operator-run pubs, up by 22.5% and 34.9%, respectively, on a like-for-like basis, which was
primarily driven by an increase in footfall in our pubs as a result of the Euro football championship and England
playing in the finals.

These preliminary results have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, management and are based solely
on preliminary internal information. Our most recent financial quarter ended on June 30, 2024. During the course
of our financial statement closing process, we could identify items that would require us to make adjustments that
could affect the results discussed above. Because these results are preliminary, they could change significantly,
and they may not be indicative of the financial quarter or any other period. See “Forward-looking Statements”
and “Risk Factors” generally for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future
performance and results of operations.

This preliminary information has not been audited and/or reviewed by our independent auditors.

**The Transactions**

The Transactions consist of the Issuance of the Notes, receipt of shareholder contribution from entities owned by
TDR Capital (which may be pursuant to an equity investment or the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement),
entering into the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the RCF Amendment Agreement and the Indenture in each
case on or prior to the Issue Date, as applicable, the entry into associated documentation including the Transaction
Security Documents, the use of proceeds of the various financing steps and any step or other matter incidental
thereto.

In connection with the Issuance, the Issuer has entered into a backstop agreement (the “Backstop Agreement”)
with certain holders of the Existing Notes, who together hold approximately 54% of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Existing Notes across all three series of the Existing Notes (the “Backstop Parties”).
Pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, the Backstop Parties have agreed to participate in the Issuance and purchase
a portion of the Offered Notes, and/or backstop the remaining portion of the Offered Notes not otherwise
purchased by other parties, in each case on the certain pricing terms specified therein. In compensation for such
backstop arrangements, the Issuer has agreed to issue the Premium Sterling Notes to the Backstop Parties. In
addition, the Backstop Agreement also provides for certain cash compensation payable to the Backstop Parties.
The backstop provided by the Backstop Parties is subject to customary conditions, and may be terminated if the
Issuance has not completed on or prior to August 31, 2024 or such later date as may be agreed between the Issuer
and the majority Backstop Parties.

The Transactions present a significant overhaul of our capital structure, backed by a material contribution by our
sponsor, TDR Capital. Pursuant to the refinancing, our maturity runway in respect of our senior debt is extended
by five years and of our second lien debt by one and half years, with strong day one liquidity (consisting of
approximately £112 million of cash, and £150 million of credit facilities and £25 million of overdraft facilities
available to draw under the Revolving Facilities). Further, our cash debt service costs are eased given the
prepayment of the amortizing Unique A4 Notes and the elimination of cash interest payments in respect of the
Second Lien Facility. As a result, the Transactions are expected to improve our free cash flow generation and

10


-----

thereby support further investment in growth opportunities. In addition, the Transactions also preserve the scale
and benefit to the Stonegate Group from the portfolio of 1,034 Leased and Tenanted pubs, which, were transferred
to certain unrestricted subsidiaries of the Stonegate Group in connection with a limited recourse financing
transaction completed in January 2024. See “—Platinum Transactions.”

**Platinum Transactions**

On January 26, 2024, we completed a limited recourse financing of a portfolio of 1,034 Platinum Pubs, which was
structured as a sale to certain Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent (the “Platinum Transactions”).

On or about December 20, 2023, we designated Stonegate Entity A Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Parent, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Platinum Group”), as Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
among others, under the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Existing Second Lien
Facility Agreement. Thereafter, on January 26, 2024, the Stonegate Group completed the transfer of the Platinum
Pubs to the Platinum Group for an aggregate consideration of £810 million. The transfers comprised assets
transfers in the case of the free-of-tie pubs, and share transfers in respect of three property-owning special purpose
vehicles. Of the aggregate consideration of £810 million, £609 million was received by the Stonegate Group as
cash proceeds, funded pursuant to the Platinum Facilities incurred by the Platinum Group (as described below),
and Stonegate Group issued a promissory note for the remaining £201 million owed by Platinum Group(the
“Platinum Promissory Note”). The Platinum Promissory Note bears interest at a capitalized payment-in-kind
(PIK) rate of 14.00% and matures eight years from the closing of the Platinum Transaction.

The Platinum Pubs portfolio comprises 944 tied pubs and 90 free-of-tie pubs, held on a freehold basis, which
contributed an adjusted EBITDA of £78 million for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024. See “Summary Historical
_and Pro Forma Financial and Other Information—Certain Non-IFRS Financial Information in relation to the_
_Stonegate Group.” The Platinum Pubs portfolio is predominantly weighted towards the South of England and_
generates the majority of its revenue from drink sales, with a mid-market focus and a strong bias towards wellpopulated, suburban locations. As part of the Platinum Transactions, the Parent has also entered into certain
agreements with Platinum Group on an arm’s length basis to provide the Platinum Pubs portfolio with certain
management and procurement services, which are also described below.

The Platinum Transactions followed a comprehensive and competitive process undertaken by us, and marked a
significant step in achieving our long-term balance sheet goals and facilitating deleveraging, while preserving
optionality and value upside. Pursuant to the Platinum Transactions, the Stonegate Group raised £609 million of
day-one cash proceeds, a significant portion of which is being utilized in connection with the Transactions, and
supported deleveraging of the Stonegate Group by virtue of the credit support afforded by the Platinum Promissory
Note. In addition, the Platinum Transactions enable us to continue to benefit from the contribution by the Platinum
Pubs portfolio to our scale, allowing us to retain strategic oversight and optionality for a future sale of the Platinum
Pubs portfolio in a value maximizing market environment and preserves value upside as well as efficiencies of
scale from the portfolio remaining within the Group.

Pursuant to a services agreement entered between the Parent and the relevant Platinum Group entities (the
“Services Agreement”), the Parent provides, in exchange for specified fees, certain services, including but not

annually per tied pub and £3,000 per free-of-tie pub, adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index.

The Parent is to provide services to pubs owned by the Platinum Group in the same manner as it would to pubs

care as would reasonably be expected from an experienced manager of pubs of like scale and quality and to act in

notice, provided that the Platinum Group and the lender agent consent to such termination and that a substitute
manager, as approved by the lender agent, is appointed prior to termination.

**_Procurement Agreement_**

The Parent also entered into, in its capacity as supplier, a certain procurement agreement (“the **Procurement**
**Agreement”) with the Platinum Group, pursuant to which the Parent sources drink products for purchase by**
publicans of the Platinum Pubs at cost, net of any rebates, refunds or discounts the Parent may receive. Any

reasonable incidental to the supply of drink products is also provided at cost. The Parent also procures that its
third-party suppliers provide such equipment and technical sales support services as may be reasonably requested
by the publicans free of charge.

Under the Procurement Agreement, the Parent is required to use reasonable efforts to ensure that sufficient drink
products are in stock so as to fulfil any orders placed by publicans of Platinum Pubs. The Parent is also required
to notify the Platinum Group of any material changes to the terms of third-party supplier contracts that will
materially impact the supply of drink products to pubs owned by the Platinum Group. As a supplier, the Parent is
to provide procurement services to Platinum Pubs in the same manner as it would to pubs prior to the Platinum
Transactions or to in respect of its other current Leased and Tenanted pubs, whichever standard is higher. In
discharging its duties as supplier, the Parent is required to exercise the level of professional skill, diligence and
care as would reasonably be expected from an experienced supplier to pubs of like scale and quality and to act in
good faith at all times.

The Parent may engage third party subcontractors to provide certain services necessary to ensure the supply of
products in a manner consistent with past practice. Any costs of subcontracting in respect of providing
procurement services will be covered by the management fees the Parent receives under the Services Agreement.
Any costs of subcontracting pursuant to a request from the Platinum Group for services not in the ordinary course
will be in addition to the management fees and charged to the applicable Platinum Group entity.

The Procurement Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by (i) the Platinum Group or the lender agent
under the Platinum Facilities upon customary grounds for termination or (2) by the Parent with at least six-months’
notice, provided that the Platinum Group and the lender agent consent to such termination and that a substitute
supplier, as approved by the lender agent, is appointed prior to termination.

**_Platinum Facilities_**

To partially fund the cash consideration in connection with the purchase of the Platinum Pubs, on December 20,
2023, certain Platinum Group entities entered into English-law governed secured whole-business loan agreements,
consisting of a senior facility agreement (the “Platinum **SFA”) and a mezzanine facility agreement (the**
“Platinum **MFA” and, together with the Platinum SFA, the “Platinum Facilities”). The Platinum Facilities were**
fully drawn by the Platinum Group on or about the date of completion of the Platinum Transactions, which was
January 26, 2024.

The Platinum SFA provides for a term loan credit facility in the amount of £438,000,000. Loans under the
Platinum SFA initially bear interest rate equal to the 3-month SONIA rate, subject to a floor of 2.5%, plus a margin
of 5.00% per annum. The Platinum MFA provides for a term loan credit facility in the amount of £200,000,000.
Loans under the Platinum MFA initially bear interest rate equal to the 3-month SONIA rate, subject to a floor of

receive proceeds from permitted property disposals.

The Platinum Facilities are each guaranteed by certain Platinum Group entities and are secured pursuant to English
law governed security agreements granting security over all assets of relevant Platinum Group entities. The lenders
under the Platinum Facilities do not have any recourse to the Stonegate Group. The Platinum Facilities rank senior
to the Platinum Promissory Note.

The Platinum Facilities require the Platinum Group obligor entities to observe certain covenants, including
covenants relating to incurrence of financial indebtedness, incurrence of guarantee or indemnity, shareholder
distributions, issuance of shares and business combination. The Platinum Facilities also contain an information
covenant and a financial covenant. In addition, the Platinum Facilities prescribe certain operational controls on
the Platinum Group, including (but not limited to) limitations relating to capital expenditures, letting activities,
property title split, disposal of certain assets and properties and reorganization.

**Corporate and Financing Structure**

The following diagram summarizes our corporate structure and principal outstanding financing arrangements after
giving effect to the Transactions. For a summary of the material financing arrangements identified in this diagram,
see “Capitalization,” “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.” The diagram is
intended for illustrative purposes only and does not include all legal entities. All entities shown below are 100%
directly or indirectly wholly-owned, unless otherwise mentioned.

(1) TDR Capital controls Stonegate Group. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, TDR Capital and Stonegate Group’s senior

Entities owned by funds managed by our sponsor, TDR Capital, have entered into certain arrangements with AlbaCore, pursuant to

sponsor funding a minimum cash amount of £200 million to provide additional funding and/or deleveraging to the Stonegate Group,
and it may or may not be completed as of the Issue Date. If this transaction is completed, such completion is to be simultaneous with
the provision of the sponsor contribution, and the corresponding commitments of AlbaCore under the Existing PIK Facility Agreement

principal amount of the Offered Euro Notes. In addition, on the Issue Date, the Issuer will also issue £36,916,000 in aggregate principal
amount of the Premium Sterling Notes. We intend to use the proceeds from the Notes, the Second Lien Facility and shareholder
contribution, along with cash on balance sheet to (i) redeem any and all outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes,
(ii) redeem any and all outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Class A Unique Notes, (iii) part-prepay borrowings under the
Revolving Facilities, (iv) discharge our liabilities under the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement in full and (v) pay certain costs,
fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(4) The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank, equally in right of payment with all unsubordinated indebtedness of the
Issuer, senior to all indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and effectively senior to all unsecured
indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the assets securing the Notes. On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be, guaranteed on a
senior secured basis by the Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of the Guarantors, will rank equally in right of
payment with all the existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor, senior to all the existing and future indebtedness
of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and effectively senior to all existing and
future unsecured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the assets securing such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. For the 52 weeks
ended April 7, 2024, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented approximately 97% of the Stonegate Group’s revenue (excluding the
revenue contribution of Unique Group, net of certain consolidation adjustments) and approximately 98% of the sum of Stonegate Group
Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 (excluding the revenue contribution of Unique Group, net of certain
consolidation adjustments). As of April 7, 2024, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented approximately 100% of Stonegate Group’s
net assets (excluding the net asset contribution of Unique Group, net of certain consolidation adjustments). Any company that is, or
becomes, a guarantor in respect of the Revolving Facilities will also be required, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to become a
guarantor in respect of the Notes. Consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, no guarantee or security will be provided by any
member of the Unique Group or in respect of any assets of the Unique Group.

(5) Upon their issuance and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable Security Documents and Permitted Collateral Liens,
the Notes will be, secured by certain material assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The Collateral also secures obligations under the
Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into).
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving
Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements (as defined herein) and any Operating Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) that are secured by assets that also secure obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, will receive priority with
respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.

(6) In connection with the Transactions:

     - We will enter into the RCF Amendment Agreement, pursuant to which, on or before the Issue Date, certain amendments to
the Revolving Facilities Agreement will come into effect, including the extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facilities
to January 31, 2029. The Revolving Facilities under the Revolving Facilities Agreement provide for multicurrency credit
facilities in an aggregate amount of £273 million (of which £25 million as an overdraft facility). The Revolving Facilities
are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer and are secured by the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Revolving Facilities Agreement.”_

     - On or before the Issue Date, we will enter into the Second Lien Facility Agreement, which provides for the Second Lien
Facility in the aggregate principal amount of £156 million. The Second Lien Facility matures on the earlier of (i) the date
falling three months after the maturity date of the Notes and (ii) October 31, 2029. We intend to utilize the proceeds from
the Second Lien Facility in connection with the Transactions, including the repayment in full of the Existing Second Lien
Facility. The Second Lien Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer and is secured by the Collateral. See “Use
_of Proceeds” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Second Lien Facility Agreement.”_

     - On or prior to the Issue Date, we expect to receive shareholder contribution from entities owned by TDR Capital, which we
expect to utilize in connection with the Transactions, including the discharge of our liabilities under the Existing Second
Lien Facility. Such subordinated funding may be pursuant to an equity investment or the Sponsor Subordinated Loan
Agreement. The Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement, if entered into, is expected to provide for a PIK term loan facility
and may be secured on the Collateral on a deeply subordinated basis, ranking behind the Notes in right of payment. In
addition, the Sponsor Subordinated Loan, if entered into, is expected to be unguaranteed, and have a maturity after the
maturity date of the Notes.

(7) Pursuant to the Ei Acquisition, the Unique Securitized Notes have been rolled over and form part of Stonegate Group’s capital structure.
For a description of the Unique Securitization, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Unique Securitized Notes.” In connection with
the Transactions, we intend to redeem any and all principal amount of Class A Unique Notes outstanding, pursuant to which the Class
N Unique Notes shall remain outstanding.

(8) The Platinum Group has been designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Existing Indenture, the Existing Second Lien Facility
Agreement and the Revolving Facilities Agreement, and will be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and the
Second Lien Facility Agreement. They will therefore not be subject to the restrictive covenants of the Indenture governing the Notes.
In connection with the Platinum Transactions, the Platinum Group has incurred the Platinum Facilities. The lenders under the Platinum
Facilities do not have any recourse to the Stonegate Group. See “Summary—Platinum Transactions” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Financial Profile, the Notes and the Note Guarantees—Unrestricted subsidiaries, including the Platinum Group, will not be_

**Further issuance of Notes .............** Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer will be permitted to
issue additional Notes. Additional Notes shall be treated, along with all
other notes issued under the Indenture, as a single class for the purposes
of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other
matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series.

For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, additional
Notes shall be deemed to form one series with any notes previously
issued under the Indenture if they have terms substantially identical in
all material respects to such other notes. In the event that any additional
Notes issued after the date hereof and sold pursuant to Rule 144A are
not fungible with any notes previously issued under the Indenture for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible additional Notes
shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other
securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are
distinguishable from such previously issued notes under the Indenture.
Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may
be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities
identification number as the applicable series of notes previously issued
under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for

20


-----

U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined
in “Tax Considerations— _Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation_
_Considerations”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to_
Regulation S, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the
particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the
potential issuance of additional Notes that are not fungible with the
applicable series of initial notes issued under the Indenture for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of
being separately identified.

**Change of Control .........................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control,
the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
redeemed on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.” However, a change of control will not be deemed to have_
occurred if certain consolidated leverage ratios are not exceeded in
connection with such an event. See “Description of the Notes—Change
_of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants .........................** The Indenture relating to the Notes, among other things, will restrict the
ability of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                 - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                 - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or
redeem our stock;

                 - make investments or other restricted payments;

                 - enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’
ability to pay dividends;

                 - transfer or sell assets;

                 - engage in transactions with affiliates;

                 - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

                 - impair security interests; and

                 - merge or consolidate with or into another company.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions .....................** We have not registered the Notes or the Note Guarantees under the
Securities Act. You may only offer or sell the Notes in transactions that
are exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” We have not agreed to, or otherwise
undertaken, to register the Notes under the Securities Act.

**No Prior Market ............................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers
have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at any
time without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing .............................................** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be
granted or that such listing will be maintained.

**Use of Proceeds ..............................** We intend to use the proceeds from the Notes, the Second Lien Facility
and shareholder contribution, along with cash on balance sheet to (i)
redeem any and all outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Existing Notes, (ii) redeem any and all outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Class A Unique Notes, (iii) part-prepay borrowings under
the Revolving Facilities, (iv) discharge our liabilities under the Existing
Second Lien Facility Agreement in full and (v) pay certain costs, fees
and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**Governing Law ..............................** The Indenture and the Note Guarantees will be, governed by the laws
of the State of New York. The Revolving Facilities Agreement, the
Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement are
governed by English law. The Security Documents are governed by
English law or the laws of the Cayman Islands, as applicable.

_September 26, 2021, the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 have_
_been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. These audited consolidated financial statements financial statements have been prepared in_
_accordance with IFRS. The summary historical condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the_
_28 weeks ended April 9, 2023 and April 7, 2024 have been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated_
_interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks_

_end, which, for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 were September 28, 2020, September 27, 2021 and September 26,_
_2022, respectively, to the Sunday nearest to our accounting reference date._

_The income statement information, as well as the other financial and operating information, for the 52 weeks_
_ended April 7, 2024 has been derived by adding the relevant item for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and_
_for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, and subtracting the relevant item for the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023._

_Group and Platinum Group); all references to Stonegate Group are to the Company and its Restricted_
_Subsidiaries (which excludes the Platinum Group); and all references to “we,” “us,” “our” are to the Group,_
_unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires._

_The Stonegate Group metrics presented herein have been calculated by excluding the operating results of 1,034_
_Platinum Pubs, assuming that the Platinum Transactions were completed at the beginning of the relevant period_
_for which such metrics are presented in this Offering Memorandum. The Stonegate Group figures presented herein_
_have not been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards._
_Such figures may not have been prepared on the same basis as the Group figures and therefore investors should_
_not place undue reliance on such figures._

_We also present certain KPIs and other non-IFRS measures below that we use to evaluate our operating and_
_financial performance. Such KPIs and non-IFRS measures include, among others, (a) in respect of the Group,_
_Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA, Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Group Capital_
_Expenditure, Acquisition Capital Expenditure, Investment Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital_
_Expenditure, Group Cash Conversion and Group Return on Investment and (b) in respect of the Stonegate Group,_

_measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our_
_performance. Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt, Stonegate Group Adjusted Cash Interest Expense and_
_Stonegate Group Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt presented below provide information on an “adjusted”_
_basis to give effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on April 10, 2023. The unaudited_
_adjusted financial information presented below does not purport to represent what our actual net debt and lease_
_adjusted net debt would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on April 10, 2023, or what our actual_
_cash interest expense would have been had the Transactions actually occurred, and our debt as of April 7, 2024_
_incurred, on April 10, 2023, nor does it purport to represent these metrics as of or for any future date or for any_
_future period. The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for_
_information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or audited or reviewed in_
_accordance with any applicable auditing standards. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-_

(1) In our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, a prior period restatement in
respect of the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 was recorded to correct the mapping of consolidation journal for the prior period and

is reflected here. The impact of the correction for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 was a reduction of revenue by £7 million to
£707 million and a reduction of operating costs by £7 million to £664 million. There was no net impact on EBITDA. See also
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—The 52 weeks
_ended September 26, 2021 Compared to the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022.”_

(2) Our Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA represents profit/(loss) for the period excluding UK income tax credit/(charge), movement in fair
value of swaps, finance cost, finance income, (profit)/loss on sale of non-current assets and depreciation, amortization, impairment and
revaluation. Group Adjusted EBITDA represents Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisition and integration costs, proceeds
and/or costs incurred in relation to business interruption insurance claims, surrender premiums, business reorganization costs,
discretionary management fees, non-cash share-based payment charge recognized pursuant to IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment) in relation
to our management incentive program, pension scheme service costs, profits and losses on disposed/non-trading sites and other nonrecurring costs (such as lease renegotiation costs with landlord in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the amount corresponding to
increase in increase in health and safety provisions recognized by us).

**Group Adjusted EBITDA ..................** **154** **477** **453** **223** **239** **469**

(a) Represents certain acquisition and integration costs that we incurred during the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 in relation
to our acquisition of the Ei Group, which we had previously completed on March 3, 2020.

(b) Represents the proceeds and/or costs, fees and expenses incurred by us in relation to the business interruption insurance claim
with our insurers for revenue loss and additional costs in light of the closure of our pubs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For
the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, adjustments towards business interruption
insurance consisted of, respectively, £14 million and £40 million of insurance proceeds received by us in relation to the insurance
claim for the closure of our pubs as a result of COVID-19. For each of the other periods, consisted of certain costs, fees and
expenses incurred by us in relation to the insurance claim.

(c) Represents the assignment premiums paid by us to our Pub Partners in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease
at any point other than at renewal, generally in relation to the implementation of our pub conversion program. We periodically
carry out a detailed review and identify opportunities to convert pubs in each of our Leased and Tenanted, Managed and Operatorrun formats to the other formats, generally with a view to identifying the optimum operating format of the pub, potentially uplift
EBITDA per pub and increase profitability.

(d) Represents certain business reorganization costs in relation to the Group restructuring of its support function, including associated
legal and professional fees.

(e) Represents the payment by us to TDR Capital of certain management fees. See “Principal Shareholders” and “Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management fees and Other Transactions with TDR Capital.”_

(f) Represents the non-cash share-based payment charge recognized by us pursuant to IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment) in relation to
the assumed vesting period under our management incentive program. See also “Management—Management Incentive
_Program.”_

(g) Represents the difference between the expected return on assets and the actual return on assets in the Group’s two defined benefit
pension schemes that provide benefits based on final pensionable salary.

(h) Represents losses generated at sites that were disposed of or closed by us in the ordinary course during the periods presented, as
if such disposals or site closures occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

(i) Represents certain professional fees incurred by the Group in connection with the Platinum Transactions.

(j) Represents, among other things, lease renegotiation costs with landlords in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount
corresponding to an increase in health and safety provisions recognized by us and the dual costs of distribution incurred to
facilitate certain changes of providers.

(3) Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Group Adjusted EBITDA divided by our Group’s revenue. We have derived Group
Adjusted EBITDA as set out in note 2 above. Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-IFRS measure that has important limitations
as an analytical tool. You should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. See
“Certain Definitions” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

(4) Group Capital Expenditure represents the sum of our Group’s purchase of property, plant and equipment and payments to acquire trading
sites for the periods presented, which, for operational purposes, we categorize as Acquisition Capital Expenditure, Investment Capital
Expenditure and Maintenance Capital Expenditure.

(5) Group Cash Conversion represents Group Adjusted EBITDA less Maintenance Capital Expenditure, divided by Group Adjusted
EBITDA, as shown below:

**Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA ........................................................................................** **411.6**

(a) Represents the net impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA, which was £78 million for the 52
weeks ended September 24, 2023, £41 million for the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023 and £43 million for the 28 weeks ended
April 7, 2024.

(b) Represents our estimate of the additional revenue from Stonegate Group’s Leased and Tenanted pubs that would have been
generated had we implemented the price increases of drinks products supplied to tied Pub Partners throughout the period between
April 2023 and April 2024 effective April 10, 2023. As part of our periodic pricing assessment, we increased the price of drink
products supplied by us to tied Pub Partners in April 2024. Based on our assessment of market trends, our estimate for additional
revenue from such price increase also includes an assumption as to decline in volumes purchased by our tied Pub Partners.

(c) Represents our estimate of the additional revenue from our Managed pubs (£11.0 million) and Operator-run pubs (£10.6 million)
that would have been generated had we implemented the various price increases of drinks and food (in the case of Managed pubs
only) sold to customers at our Managed and Operator-run pubs throughout the period between April 2023 and April 2024,
effective April 10, 2023. Based on our assessment of market trends, our estimate for additional revenue from such price increase
also includes an assumption as to decline in drink volumes, purchased at our Managed and Operator-run pubs.

(d) Represents our estimate of net decrease in procurement cost of drinks purchased by us for Stonegate Group’s Leased and
Tenanted, Managed and Operator-run pubs, and food products for Stonegate Group’s Managed pubs, had we purchased the drink
and food products at the current price through the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024. In estimating such costs, we have also assumed
a decline in volume of drinks and food products purchased by us, in same percentage as in notes (b) and (c) above (where we
estimate the additional revenue that we would have earned had we charged a higher price to our Pub Partners and at our Managed
and Operator-run pubs through the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024).

(e) Represents our estimate of the additional revenue from the new “Media” screens already installed and/or committed, assuming
these screens had been in place effective April 10, 2023. One of our key digital strategies is the “Media” initiative, which involves
the installation of digital advertising screens at our Managed sites. We estimated the additional revenue by annualizing our
estimated incremental revenue for the third quarter of the year ending September 29, 2024 attributable to the “Media” screens
already installed/committed and by excluding the additional revenue earned from such screens by us during the first two quarters
of this period. Committed screens refer to those where the relevant advertising agreements are put in place but the screens have
not yet been installed.

(f) Represents the estimated energy cost savings in relation to electricity and gas that we would have realized during the 52 weeks
ended April 7, 2024, calculated as the sum of:

   - cost savings in relation to energy hedging arrangements at current levels, pursuant to which we have hedged almost 100%
and 75% of our expected electricity usage for summer and winter 2024 and 98% and 78% of our expected gas usage for
summer and winter 2024, at a fixed price. We estimate that had we entered into these energy hedging arrangements for
the entire duration of the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024, our energy costs would have been reduced by £4 million, as
compared to the costs we would have had during the same period;

   - we have implemented certain energy-saving measures at our Managed pub sites to reduce consumption of energy,
including installation of smart meters. Based on our review of energy consumption data at our Managed Pubs, we estimate
that we would have saved £2 million on an annualized basis had these measures been implemented as of April 10, 2023;
and

   - we estimate that our energy costs would have been reduced by £4 million for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024, if we had
actually benefited from the drop in energy prices and purchased gas and electricity at current spot prices which represents
an incremental cost saving to the hedging arrangements mentioned above.

(g) Represents adjustments made to give 52-week effect to (i) incremental site EBITDA generated post-investment at certain of
Stonegate Group pubs, in which we have completed investments or have formally approved investment during the 52 weeks
ended April 7, 2024, as if such investments had completed on April 10, 2023 and (ii) incremental EBITDA generated by us
further to the sale of certain loss making sites that we completed during the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024, had we completed the

28


-----

sale of such sites on April 7, 2024. Incremental site EBITDA generated post-investment in our pubs, is calculated in relation to
Investment Capital Expenditure at certain of our Managed, Operator-run and Leased and Tenanted pubs for renovations or
refurbishments, and in relation to the conversion from Leased and Tenanted to Craft Union or Managed Pubs format and from
Managed to Craft Union or Leased and Tenanted format. This adjustment does not reflect the actual site EBITDA that a pub
would have generated during the period that it was closed down for renovation or refurbishment. All capital expenditure and
related expenses pertaining to these investments have been recognized in the period presented. Approximately 29% of such
incremental site EBITDA has been already realized and reflected in our historical results during the 52 weeks ended April 7,
2024.

(h) Represents our initiatives to optimize organizational functions across our operations and reduce headcount, which we estimate
would have resulted in an incremental annual cost savings of £8 million had we completed such optimization as of April 10,
2024. A majority of the identified headcount reductions were completed during the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 and we expect
the remaining reductions to be completed by the beginning of the year ending September 30, 2025. Our cost savings estimate is
incremental to severance and other related costs that we incurred in our historical results during the 52 weeks ended April 7,
2024.

(i) Represents our estimate of the net impact of the aggregate incremental costs associated with an increase in cost of wages, pursuant
to an increase in the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage. For the purposes of calculating the incremental
increases in cost of wages, we have applied the National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage rates that came into effect
on April 1, 2024 throughout the period from April 10, 2023 to April 7, 2024. This estimate also makes an assumption as to the
decline in drink and/or food volumes mentioned above following increased prices, and thereby assumes a reduction in labor
requirement hours.

(j) Represents our estimate of the reduced sales in our Managed and Operator-run pubs for periods impacted by train strikes in the
UK. During the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024, we estimate that we have experienced reduced sales for 7 weeks due to drop in
footfall in our pubs caused by train strikes. We have calculated reduced sales for each pub for the affected periods by comparing
the sales it generated during the comparable period in the previous year.

(k) Represents our estimate of the additional revenue that would have been generated (a) from the full roll out of our “Media” digital
screen in accordance with our business plan (expected from financial year 2025 and onwards), by installing additional advertising
screens across our Managed pubs estate as of April 10, 2023 (£8.5 million), (b) from the full adoption of our MiXR mobile
application (which is a cross portfolio loyalty application that engages customers across multiple brands by our customers) in
accordance with our business plan (expected from financial year 2025 onwards), assuming the MiXR mobile application was
fully adopted across our pubs as of April 10, 2023 (£11.7 million) and (c) incremental site EBITDA from the conversion of
additional pubs, in particular, the conversion of high-performing Leased and Tenanted pubs in the Stonegate Group’s estate to
more profitable Managed and/or Operator-run formats, which in accordance with our approved business plan we intend to
implement through the financial year 2027 (£18.0 million).

This Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has not been prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act, and does not purport to represent what our results of operations would have been, nor do they purport to project the results of
operations for any future period. Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA and Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as used in
this Offering Memorandum may not be calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” which is calculated pursuant to the
Indenture as described under “Description of the Notes” or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness. For the purposes of the
unaudited Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA included herein, we have made various assumptions. The adjustments and
assumptions we have made are preliminary and subject to change. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” See also
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The adjustments to our Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA to derive our resulting
_Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA should be treated with caution when making an investment decision.”_

(11) Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents the Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by
Stonegate Group’s revenue, which is calculated by excluding the revenue attributable to the 1,034 Leased and Tenanted pubs in the
Platinum Group from the Group’s historical revenue, as show in note (7) above, but does not include any pro forma adjustments to
revenue, as discussed in Note 10 of “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and other Information.” Stonegate Group Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-IFRS measure that has important limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider it in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Non-IFRS Financial Information” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma Combined Financial_
_Information.”_

(12) We define our like for like metrics presented above, as follows:

(a) Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, aggregate change in revenue from
Managed pubs compared to the previous comparable period made at all Managed Pubs open and operated throughout the current
and previous period;

(b) Stonegate Group Operator-run Revenue Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, aggregate change in revenue
compared to the previous comparable period made at all Stonegate Group’s Operator-run pubs open and operated throughout the
current and previous period; and

(c) Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like) represents the percentage growth in the pub level revenue from Stonegate
Group’s Leased and Tenanted estate (which excludes the Platinum Group estate) for all pubs that have traded in the estate for
the current and previous period, and excludes income in respect of disposals.

For more information concerning how these metrics are calculated, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— Non-IFRS
_Financial Information.”_

(13) Group Return on Investment represents, for all pubs in the Group’s estate invested during the 156 weeks preceding the date on which
we present the Return on Investment, the difference between the annualized (on a 52-week basis) aggregate weekly average postinvestment pre-adjusted EBITDA and the 52-week pre-investment pre-adjusted EBITDA of those pubs, divided by the aggregate
Investment Capital Expenditure invested in these pubs over the same 52 weeks. Where a pub has traded for less than 52 weeks postinvestment, we have not taken it into account when calculating the Return on Investment. Pubs where we have not made an Investment
Capital Expenditure in the past 52 weeks are classed as uninvested. For more information concerning how this metric is calculated, see
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information.”

(14) Represents sites closed in the ordinary course of business as of April 7, 2024.

(15) Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt and Stonegate Group Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt are calculated as follows:

29


-----

(a) Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt represents Stonegate Group’s net debt as of April 7, 2024 less Stonegate Group’s lease
liability as of April 7, 2024, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. Stonegate
Group Adjusted Net Debt as of April 7, 2024 is calculated as:

(i) the sum of £1,682 million in aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes, £395 million in respect of the Offered Euro
Notes, which represents the pound sterling equivalent amount of €470 million of the aggregate principal amount of the
Offered Euro Notes, converted from euro at an exchange rate of €1.19 per £1.00 (which represents the spot exchange rate
as of July 15, 2024 obtained by us from a third-party platform), £98 million of borrowings under the Revolving Facilities,
£190 million in aggregate principal amount of the Class N Unique Notes and £156 million of borrowings under the Second
Lien Facility, less

(ii) £112 million of cash and cash equivalents as of April 7, 2024, as adjusted for the Transactions.

(b) Stonegate Group Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt as of April 7, 2024 is calculated as Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt
as of April 7, 2024 less £156 million of borrowings under our Second Lien Facility Agreement.

See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

(16) Stonegate Group Adjusted Cash Interest Expense represents Stonegate Group’s cash interest expense for the 52 weeks ended April 7,
2024 in respect of its debt as of April 7, 2024, assuming that such debt was incurred as of April 10, 2023, and further adjusted to give
effect to the Transactions. Stonegate Group Adjusted Cash Interest Expense has been calculated in respect of (i) £1,682 million in
aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes and €470 million in aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes, (ii) £98 million of
borrowings under our Revolving Facilities Agreement (including any commitment fee in relation undrawn amount) and (iii) £190
million of aggregate principal amount of the Class N Unique Notes, where applicable, based on a three-month SONIA or EURIBOR as
of July 23, 2024. See also “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” Stonegate Group Adjusted Cash Interest Expense excludes any
interest expense in connection with our lease liabilities, the Second Lien Facility (as the interest payable under the Second Lien Facility
is capitalized) and the Platinum Facilities.

(17) Stonegate Group LTV Ratio is the ratio of Stonegate Group Adjusted Net Debt (which excludes IFRS 16 lease liabilities) as of April 7,
2024 to Stonegate Group Freehold Property Asset Value as of September 24, 2023 (£2,802 million). Stonegate Group Freehold Property
Asset Value of £2,802 million represents the property asset value of 2,611 freehold sites of Stonegate Group as of September 24, 2023,
as determined by Avison Young. We have not adjusted the Stonegate Group Freehold Property Asset Value for any disposals since
September 24, 2023. Although, we recorded no impairment charge in respect of our property, plant and equipment during the 28 weeks
ended April 7, 2024, Stonegate Group Freehold Property Asset Value do not reflect any potential impairment in the value of our property,
plant and equipment after April 7, 2024.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,_
_together with the other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest_
_in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could be detrimental to our financial_
_performance. If any of these events occur, the trading price of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay_
_all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional_
_risks not currently known to us or which are presently deemed immaterial may also harm our business and affect_
_your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might_
_cause such differences include those discussed below. See “Forward-looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Unfavorable general economic conditions in the UK have had and may have a negative effect on our business._**

The outlook for the UK economy is currently subject to significant uncertainty, which may lead the UK into a
prolonged period of economic downturn, recession or depression. All of our pubs are located in the UK and,
therefore, our operating results are impacted by general economic conditions in the UK.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the political and social unrest in the Middle East
region after Hamas’ terrorist attacks in October 2023, global markets and economy have experienced significant
uncertainty. In particular, there has been a sharp rise in energy and food costs, resulting in inflationary macroeconomic conditions across most major economies, including the UK. Although the inflation rate in the UK has
declined in recent periods from a historic high of 11.1% in October 2022, the near-term outlook for the UK
economy remains challenging and there is no assurance that inflation rates will continue to fall. Given these
economic conditions, there has been a significant decline in disposable income of many households, creating a
cost of living crisis in the UK. Consumer spending on eating and drinking out is discretionary in nature, and as a
result, revenue, and more generally, trading environment of pubs is affected by general levels of disposable
income. A continuing cost of living crisis in the UK, would adversely impact footfall and spending by customers
in our pubs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

The pub industry in the UK is facing significant inflationary cost pressures across drinks, food and wage lines, as
well as due to the impact of increased energy costs. While there has been increase in price of beer, other drink
products, as well as food, resulting in higher procurement costs, our operating costs have been particularly
impacted by rising energy and employment costs. Where appropriate, in recent periods, we have sought to
selectively pass-on the increase in our operating costs to our Pub Partners in our Leased and Tenanted pubs (by
way of an increase in cost of drinks supplied) or customers in our Managed and Operator-run pubs (by way of an
increase in price of our drinks and food offerings). However, our continuing ability to pass-on increases in
operating cost to our Pub Partners and customers is limited. We may not be able to continue increasing the cost
of drinks supplied to our Pub Partners without exacerbating the financial challenges faced by our Pub Partners
and risking business failures. To the extent that we are able to pass-on increase in costs to our Pub Partners, this
could lead to decreased demand from their customers, and could in turn result in decrease in the volume of beer
and other drinks purchased by Pub Partners from us. In our Managed and Operator-run pubs, especially given the
ongoing cost of living crisis, a continued increase in the price of our drinks and food offerings could adversely
impact footfall and spending by customers, and we may also be subject to negative publicity in doing so, which
in turn could lead to a further loss of customers. As a consequence, our gross margins could be adversely impacted.
Although, we have benefitted from certain schemes announced by the UK government to support business with
their energy bills and have implemented various measures to control our energy and employments costs, any
continued increase in our operating costs and our inability to effectively pass-on such increase to our Pub Partners
or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

In addition, factors such as financial and political crises in the UK and the eurozone, terrorist attacks or other
unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures that may be implemented by the UK
government in connection with Brexit, high interest rates, declining wages, increased inflationary pressure, higher
unemployment, tax increases and lack of consumer credit, could all adversely affect the levels of disposable
income, which in turn may also lead to customers reducing their attendance and expenditure at pubs. Similarly,

31


-----

frequent changes to the UK government could lead to economic uncertainty and further loss of consumer
confidence. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates,
declines in income levels and disposable income and loss of personal wealth could adversely affect our business,
operating results, financial condition and prospects.

As a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during periods of challenging
macroeconomic conditions, it is difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict
the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no
assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand
due to adverse macroeconomic conditions may also have an adverse impact on the business of our Pub Partners.
We may be required to provide substantial financial assistance to our Pub Partners, so as to enable them to carry
on their operations, or we may be required to reposition our Leased and Tenanted pubs and recruit new Pub
Partners. Accordingly, a decline in demand due to the emergence of adverse economic conditions affecting the
UK could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to drinks and food may continue to change and we may be_**
**_unable to adapt to such changes._**

Our business is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to both drinks and food, as well as
demographic trends over time. For instance, many consumers are placing increasing importance on dietary and
nutritional content, as well as the provenance of locally sourced ingredients. Consumer preference and behavior
changes are typically led by dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages,
concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to
ingredients, animal welfare concerns and environmental concerns regarding packaging. Furthermore, a recent
NHS survey shows that younger generations are consuming less alcohols in recent years. In the future, these
factors may force us to change our business practices or pricing policies, which may have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, there is an increasing level of focus in the media and from the UK government on health and obesity
issues. Consumers are also increasingly demanding all-day formats and increasingly preferring premium drinks.
In addition, drink-driving laws and entertainment alternatives, such as social media, have meant that younger
generations now require more non-traditional offerings to be attracted to pubs. The UK pub industry has, as a
result of these and other factors, been experiencing a steady decrease in the number of pubs in recent years.

We have responded to these trends by offering a greater number of healthy options in our menus, increasing our
focus on our breakfast offering and expanding our premium and craft drink and food offerings. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will continue to be able to respond to these or other trends in consumer preference
by introducing changes to our formats, brands, drink and food offerings and premises or otherwise. Moreover, our
ability to respond to changes in consumer behavior is also conditioned on the willingness of each of our Pub
Partners to work with us to implement our suggested changes. Any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond
to trends in consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial
condition and prospects.

**_We may be adversely affected by an increase in consumers purchasing alcohol from supermarkets, off-licenses_**
**_and other retailers._**

Consumers’ spending patterns with respect to alcohol have evolved such that they now purchase a higher
proportion of their alcoholic drinks at supermarkets, off-licenses and other retailers than has been the case in the
past. For instance, as a result of the temporary closure of pubs and restaurants in the UK in 2020 and 2021 because
of the COVID-19 pandemic, more consumers than usual turned to these alternative sources to buy alcoholic
drinks. In particular, the on-trade beer market in the UK has been adversely affected by the pricing policies of the
large supermarket groups, with the off-trade beer market in the UK accounting for a greater proportion of UK
beer sales than in the past. This change in behavior has been due, among other things, to growing health and drinkdriving concerns, the smoking ban, the ability of consumers to purchase canned or bottled beer at lower prices at
off-license stores and supermarkets and the expansion of trading hours at those retailers, as well as to the
increasing prevalence of cable and satellite television, high speed internet access and social media, which provide
consumers with more options to entertain themselves at home. Especially given the ongoing cost of living crisis
in the UK, consumers may increasingly prefer to purchase select drinks at lower prices at off-license stores and
supermarkets where possible rather than visiting pubs. The foregoing factors have contributed to a long-term
decline in the total number of pubs in the UK. Although the rate at which consumers were shifting their spending
towards off-trade channels was no longer increasing prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend may change, in

32


-----

particular, as a consequence of the current climate of high inflation and cost of living crisis. Therefore, consumers
could potentially form new spending habits that have a longer lasting impact. Accordingly, if the trend in
consumers purchasing alcohol from supermarkets, off-licenses and other retailers were to resume along with a
sustained decline in off-trade beer prices, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could
be materially adversely affected.

**_We face competition for consumers from other managed and tenanted pub operators, independent pubs, venues_**
**_and restaurants._**

Our Managed, Operator-run and Leased and Tenanted pubs, compete for consumers against a wide variety of
pubs, bars, venues and restaurants, as well as off-license stores, supermarkets and takeaway restaurants, some of
which may offer higher amenity levels or lower prices or may be backed by greater financial and operational
resources. Our main competitors include Greene King, Marston’s, Mitchells and Butlers, Admiral Taverns, Star
Pubs and Bars and JD Wetherspoon, but we also compete with smaller pub operators and independent pubs. In
addition, consumer demand for casual dining chains, which have traditionally competed against pubs, has grown
significantly in recent years, although recently casual dining supply has been in decline. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in managing competition from casual dining chains by changing our formats and food
offering to meet consumer demand. Moreover, to the extent that venues such as coffee shops or delicatessens are
able to offer alcoholic drinks, or there is an increasing consumer preference, especially in urban areas, for premium
wine bars, we may face increased competition. We may not be successful in competing against any or all of these
alternatives and a sustained loss of customers to other pubs, bars, casual dining chains or other venues could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

Further, aggressive pricing actions by competitors may affect our ability to achieve desired revenue growth and
profitability levels under our current pricing strategies. Potential decreased demand for our products resulting
from factors including changes in consumers’ spending patterns, uncertainty in the global economy, and the
current inflationary environment, may influence competitor pricing. We may also decide to lower prices, for
example, to match competitors’ prices or to adjust for current demand levels. Additionally, dynamic pricing
models may not cover our rising costs. Even if we have been able to increase prices to cover our costs in the past,
competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to pass on cost increases anymore. Alternatively, if costs were to
decline, the marketplace may not allow us to hold prices at their current levels.

**_The effect of any future pandemics could materially negatively impact the operations of our business and,_**
**_therefore, our financial position, due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control._**

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected and in March 2020, the World Health
Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
governments of many countries, including the UK, took preventative measures to try to contain its spread. These
measures included mandatory closure of businesses, including pubs and bars, social distancing requirements and
travel restrictions, which severely diminished the level of economic activity around the world and in the UK,
contributed to significant volatility in financial markets and triggered a period of global economic slowdown. In
particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and directives from the UK government from time to time, our
pubs remained closed for business or operated under substantial operating limitations for a significant duration of
fiscals year 2020 and 2021, and a portion of fiscal year 2022. During periods of closure of pubs, we recorded no
material revenue other than nominal rent revenue and monies received in the form of government grants, which
we recognized as other income. While the COVID-19 related restrictions on our trading have been removed, there
can be no assurance that such restrictions, including social distancing requirements, restrictions on operating
hours, mandatory closure of pubs or entertainment venues or a more general lockdown, will not be re-imposed in
the event of a spread of COVID-19 again or a new variant thereof. In particular, we cannot predict when or where
new COVID-19 variants may spread or the impact of any such new COVID-19 variant or if another pandemic
will ever occur.

We had previously filed a business interruption insurance claim with our insurers for revenue loss and additional
costs in light of the closure of our pubs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our insurers disagreed with us
as to the amount payable to us under the business interruption insurance claim, and we initiated legal proceedings
against our insurers. Subsequently, we entered into a settlement agreement with our insurers and have recovered
a total amount of £54.5 million in respect of our insurance claim, which represents only a portion of the loss of
revenue we suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including

33


-----

those relating to global economic conditions, our high level of indebtedness, our ability to generate sufficient cash
flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that
govern our indebtedness. Furthermore, we depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support
our operating activities, supply capital to finance our operations and growth, make capital expenditure and manage
our debt levels. The economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and
preventive measures, adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in recent
financial periods. Recurrence of such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to make future interest and
other payments with respect to our indebtedness and other obligations.

**_Continuing legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the relationship between the UK and the_**
**_European Union may adversely impact trading and supply arrangements, which could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

The macroeconomic environment has also been negatively influenced by the uncertainty caused by the withdrawal
of the UK from the European Union. On January 31, 2020, the UK ceased to be a member of the European Union
and the European Economic Area. By virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the Withdrawal
Agreement, EU law and EU-derived domestic legislation continued to apply to and in the UK during a transition
period ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, an agreement in principle was reached in relation
to the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”, incorporating the
Northern Ireland Protocol as amended by the Windsor Framework dated February 27, 2023), to govern the future
relations between the European Union and the UK following the end of the transition period. On December 31,
2020, the UK implemented the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force provisionally on
January 1, 2021 and was ratified on April 29, 2021. Despite the implementation of the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement, there remains continuing uncertainty as to how Brexit will affect relations between the UK and the
European Union, which could negatively impact business and consumer confidence in the UK.

Due to the size and importance of the UK economy, and the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the UK’s
relationship with the European Union, enhanced by the economic uncertainty and unpredictability caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic and the current cost of living crisis, there may continue to be instability in the market,
significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adverse effects on trading agreements or similar cross border
cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future.
These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material
adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly
reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial
markets. Any reduction in our customers’ willingness or ability to spend due to Brexit-related changes in the
economic environment of the UK and Europe could materially affect our revenue. A general slowdown in the UK
economy due to Brexit or otherwise may also negatively impact our growth strategies as well as our current and
future projections, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

Further, while the majority of our products are sourced and produced within the UK, continued or sustained
adverse effects on the exchange rate of the pound sterling as compared to foreign currencies and the effective
price inflation of certain products sourced from outside of the UK resulting from the withdrawal of the UK from
the European Union could result in increased costs with respect to the products that are sourced from outside of
the UK. We cannot guarantee that we and our Pub Partners would be able to mitigate or otherwise avoid such
increased costs, and our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial
condition and prospects. Moreover, changes in the UK property market, caused by any negative development or
uncertainty pursuant to Brexit, could negatively impact the value of our property portfolio and our ability to
dispose of our assets and the realizations from such disposals.

In addition, approximately 8% of our employees as of April 7, 2024 were citizens of the European Union but not
of the UK. Accordingly, any future restrictions, whether perceived or actual, on the free movement of EU nationals
to and from the UK could impact our ability to efficiently recruit employees which could in turn have an adverse
effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, though we source our
beverage commodities from suppliers in the UK, our suppliers in turn may source a significant quantity of
beverages and other supplies from other suppliers in the European Union. Accordingly, the supply, pricing and
general availability of these commodities is influenced by, and is subject to, the outcome of the negotiations
between the UK and the European Union. Accordingly, the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union may
have an impact on suppliers’ trade relations and our ability to avoid the adverse effects of limited commodities or
an increased price thereof is limited.

**_Our capital expenditure program to convert our pubs into different formats is subject to a number of risks and_**
**_uncertainties._**

We seek to actively invest in our estate, with a particular focus on executing opportunities with relatively high
return on investment. We periodically carry out a detailed review and identify opportunities to convert pubs in
each of our Leased and Tenanted, Managed and Operator-run formats to the other formats, generally with a view
to uplift EBITDA-based measures per pub and increase profitability. For instance, after the completion of our
acquisition of Ei Group, and especially since our return to a steady state of business following the COVID-19
pandemic, we have implemented a program to convert select Leased and Tenanted pubs from Ei Group’s estate
to our Managed format or to the Craft Union format. In addition, we have also selectively converted certain
Managed pubs into Operator-run pubs, and particularly to manage our operating costs while earning revenue as
dry rent and/or wet rent, into Leased and Tenanted pubs. During the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, we
converted 15 Leased and Tenanted pubs to Managed pubs, 63 Leased and Tenanted pubs into Operator-run pubs,
23 Managed pubs to Operator-run pubs and 29 Managed pubs to Leased and Tenanted pubs. In addition, during
this period, we also converted three Operator-run pubs to Leased and Tenanted pubs. During the 28 weeks ended
April 7, 2024, we converted 1 Leased and Tenanted pub to Managed pubs, 16 Leased and Tenanted pubs into
Operator-run pubs, 24 Managed pubs to Operator-run pubs, 17 Managed pubs to Leased and Tenanted pubs and
8 Operator-run pubs to Leased and Tenanted pubs. We intend to continue implementing such conversion during
the course of financial year 2024.

Our conversion program remains subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We may fail to implement our
conversion program in a timely manner or at all. In particular, our conversion of Managed pubs into Leased and
Tenanted pubs, requires us to recruit Pub Partners and enter into lease arrangements with them. Given the cost
headwinds in the pubs sector in the UK and the general decline in number of pubs and publican operators in the
UK pub sector, there is no assurance that we will be able to recruit such Pub Partners and enter into commercially
beneficial lease arrangements in a timely manner or at all. In particular, during the periods impacted by COVID19 pandemic and our efforts at the time to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity, our ability to
make investments in our estate was limited. Following the removal of the COVID-19 restrictions and the return
to a steady state of business, we have resumed actively investing in our estate. However, based on our review of
cash flow forecasts reflecting, among other things, our levels of trade in line with pre-COVID-19 levels, sales
price increases below inflation, labor cost rises to ensure we continue paying at least National Living Wage,
certain out of contract cost price increases and significant increases in utilities costs, where required, we may
consider from to time scaling back our expansionary, conversion and maintenance capital expenditure program in
order to prudently preserve cash to face potential cost headwinds. Our failure to implement our planned conversion
program could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, our review of the potential opportunity to convert the pubs and identification of potential uplift in
EBITDA-based measures per pub is subject to a number of assumptions and estimations, including in relation the
cost base and savings per pub and the number of pubs to be converted per year, which may not prove to be
accurate. These estimates are based on our current assessment, and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions
and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. While we believe
that the methodology used to calculate our estimates in relation to our conversion program is reasonable, investors
should be aware that there are certain limitations inherent in our ability to accurately predict financial performance,
and that making the estimates presented herein requires significant critical judgment. These estimates are
“forward-looking” statements that involve various risks and uncertainties. Please see “Forward-looking
_statements.” Any of these estimates are subject to change and, in particular, we may determine that it is appropriate_
to adapt our strategy and business plan in the future. These “forward-looking” statements are not intended to be a
forecast of our future business performance and are not guarantees of future financial results, and our actual results
could differ significantly from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many
factors, including but not limited to the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

**_We may not be able to maintain our return on investment from our capital projects._**

Historically, we have identified priorities for investment in our estate through biannual estate reviews and have
put in place a multi-stage estate review process to ensure a disciplined approach to investment across our pubs.
After the COVID-19 closure period, beginning June 21, 2021 through April 7, 2024, we have refurbished
(excluding conversions) approximately 120 Managed pubs and Operator-run pubs and we plan to continue making
investments in our estate. Following these investments, there can be no assurance that we will continue to achieve
our target return on investment with respect to our uninvested sites, whether as a result of incorrect assumptions
in evaluating the investment potential or otherwise, or that we will successfully identify the sites that are most in

35


-----

need of investment or are most suitable for conversion into different operating models or formats. In addition, in
order to remain competitive, evolving industry trends with respect to the frequency of capital investment may
require capital investments to be made in pubs more frequently than we have done in the past or plan to do in the
future. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to make capital investments on a shorter timeline than we have
done in the past should such trends emerge.

Additionally, where we present Group Return on Investment in this Offering Memorandum, we have not included
in the calculation the results of pubs that have traded for fewer than 52 weeks following such investments.

**_Our management may not be able to successfully implement our strategic and financial objectives._**

We continue to, among other things, implement opportunistic conversions of pubs between Leased and Tenanted,
Managed and Operator-run estate, invest in our Managed and Operator-run estates, support our Pub Partners in
operating better pubs, exploit the potential and realize the cost savings of converting acquired pubs and make
strategic pub disposals or asset transfers part of our proactive approach to estate optimization. Additionally, on a
Group level, we continue to pursue objectives such as optimizing our pricing strategy (particularly in light of
recent inflation trends), investing in cost rationalization, implementing marketing and media initiatives (including
the MiXR initiative), and reducing our consumption of energy and our exposure to energy price volatility. See
also “Summary—Our Strategies.”

There can, however, be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our strategies. In particular, we
may be required to invest more than we have currently budgeted in order to implement our investment and
conversion plans and we may not realize anticipated levels of EBITDA-based increase or cost efficiencies from
such investments or conversions. In addition, we may not have sufficient expertise, resources or time to build the
necessary support infrastructure to achieve our strategies in the desired timeframe or at all. Management’s time
and attention from daily operations may also be diverted. The measures we implement to respond to the challenges
presented by the current economic climate or any other unforeseen circumstances could also require us to adjust
or abandon our plans. If we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategic or financial objectives, or if we are
required to spend more than we anticipated to achieve those objectives, our business, operating results, financial
condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

**_We and our Pub Partners and operators could face partner/labor shortages, increased labor costs and other_**
**_adverse effects of varying labor conditions._**

The development and success of our Managed and Operator-run pubs, as well as our Leased and Tenanted pubs,
depend, in large part, upon our (including our general managers’) and our tenant’s ability to attract, motivate and
retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including head office employees, regional managers, pub
managers, kitchen staff, bar staff and waiting staff. Qualified individuals are needed to fill these positions and our
inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new pubs or result in our existing
pubs being understaffed, which could compromise the level of service provided by these pubs. In addition, the
development and success of our Managed pubs, depend, in large part on the efforts, abilities and experience of
the general managers who manage and operate our Managed pubs. The development and success of our Leased
and Tenanted pubs depends, in large part, on the efforts, abilities and experience of our Pub Partners. Further,
licensed restaurants, cafes and bars may offer attractive alternative business opportunities for the type of partners
that we would like to work with. If we are not successful in attracting enough high quality prospective managers
and publicans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

Any significant delay in finding qualified employees could adversely affect our operating results and financial
condition. We may also incur additional costs in relation to training new employees as a result of high turnover
of our employee base. Specifically, in relation to our late night venues, we generally face a relatively higher
turnover of employees. We may not be able to find qualified employees for such venues in time or at all.

In addition, approximately 8% of our employees as of April 7, 2024 were citizens of the European Union but not
of the UK. Restrictions on the free movement of labor resulting from the withdrawal of the UK from the European
Union has led to further difficulties in finding qualified employees. In addition, competition for qualified
employees or increases in remuneration by our competitors could require us to pay higher wages to attract
sufficiently qualified employees, which could result in higher labor costs. Further, increases in the minimum
hourly wage, employment tax rates or levies, related benefits costs or similar matters over which we have no
control may increase our operating costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects.

**_Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become_**
**_subject could have a negative effect on our business._**

Our pubs are subject to laws and regulations that affect their operations, including those related to employment,
minimum wages, alcoholic drinks control, late-night levies, drink-driving, pub licensing, leisure (gaming)
machines, competition, health and safety, environmental liabilities, sanitation, data protection, access for the
disabled and, in the case of our pubs in the Leased and Tenanted segment, the Pubs Code. The responsibility to
comply with these regulations is typically distributed based on operational control over the relevant sites.
Generally, we are responsible for regulatory compliance in respect of our Managed Pubs whereas Pub Partners
are responsible for regulatory compliance, including in respect of employment regulations, for the pubs they
operate. These laws and regulations impose a significant administrative burden, as managers, operators and Pub
Partners have to devote significant time to ensure compliance with these requirements and therefore have less
time to dedicate to trade. Moreover, it is difficult to predict the changes in policies, if any, that would result from
the recent change to the UK government following the general election, which may adversely affect our business,
results of operations, financial conditions and cash flow.

The risks related to some of the key regulations to which we are subject are discussed below.

**_a._** **_The Pubs Code provides certain tied tenants the MRO option_**

On November 18, 2014, the UK Parliament introduced a series of amendments to the Small Business, Enterprise
and Employment bill which contained the Pubs Code that came into effect on July 21, 2016. These include the
requirement for large pub-owning businesses that own 500 or more tied pubs in England and Wales to provide
their tenants and leaseholders, at certain specified times or on the occurrence of certain specified events (such as
five-yearly rent reviews), with the MRO option that is overseen by an independent adjudicator. The independent
adjudicator has, among others, the power to require pub-owning businesses to pay in each financial year a levy
towards the adjudicator’s expenses. Moreover, the Pubs Code discourages, in any one year, increases in price for
beer by more than 3% above the consumer price index (“CPI”), other alcoholic drinks by more than 8% above
the CPI, products other than alcoholic drinks and services by more than 20% above the CPI, each of which, can
limit our ability to pass on cost increases to Pub Partners. It contemplates fines of up to 1% of the pub-owning
group’s annual turnover for breach of the provisions of the Pubs Code.

The MRO option enables some occupational tenants to convert to a free-of-tie lease at certain points or after
certain events during the term of their agreement, and thereby pay rent and building insurance only. Accordingly,
there is a risk that some our Pub Partners with long-term leases may opt for the MRO option over a period of time
and convert their lease agreements to free-of-tie arrangements. In the event that a large number of our Pub Partners
elect to invoke this option, while our income derived from the supply of tied drinks products would be partially
offset by increases in rent, our total income would likely decline. While the introduction of the MRO option has
not yet had a material impact on our business, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case. As
of April 7, 2024, 886 out of 4,414 sites of the Group, or 20%, operated on a tied lease, and 298 out of 4,414 sites
of the Group, or 6.8%, operated on a free-of-tie lease. From the date of the introduction of the Pubs Code in July
2016 to April 7, 2024, there have been 2,379 rent review or agreement renewal events across 1,691 pubs which
could potentially have triggered an MRO request. As required under the Pubs Code, we have accepted 674 notices
by tenants of which 341 have been concluded by way of mutually agreed tied deals and 181 have resulted in new
mutually agreed MRO terms. In addition, 91 tenants left the pub, 25 claims were withdrawn by the tenant or had
other outcomes with the balance of 36 pending. Of the outstanding 36, 4 have been referred to the Pubs Code
adjudicator for determination. Of the 1,691 pubs referred to above, 734 pubs were still operated by the same tenant
on either tied or new free-of-tie agreements as of April 7, 2024.

Furthermore, while the Pubs Code has now been in place for seven years, there still remains a lack of clarity
around some areas of the Pubs Code leaving elements open to interpretation. In addition, the Pubs Code is subject
to potential consultation and statutory review, which may add extra uncertainty about the interpretation, impact
and application of Pubs Code going forward.

**_b._** **_Employment regulations provide certain rights and protections to our employees, and changes to these_**
**_regulations may reduce our ability to operate our business efficiently._**

The Working Time Regulations (the “WT Regulations”) provide that workers may only be required to work a
48-hour week, although they can choose to opt out and work longer if they wish. The WT Regulations also set out
rights and protections in areas such as minimum rest time, days off and paid leave. A substantial majority of our
employees (but not including our general managers) are covered by the WT Regulations. The existence of the
ability to opt out of, and the guidance as to who is covered by, the WT Regulations may change in the future. In
addition, under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (the “Part
**Time Workers Regulations”), part-time workers can claim the same employment and related rights as full-time**
workers. The Fixed Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 (the “Fixed
**Term Employees Regulations”) similarly provide that employees engaged under fixed-term contracts can claim**
the same employment and related rights as employees engaged under permanent contracts.

The WT Regulations, Part Time Workers Regulations and Fixed Term Employees Regulations, and any changes
to such regulations, may impose constraints on our ability to deploy employees efficiently to a degree that could
adversely affect our operating costs and, in turn, our operating results, financial condition and prospects. In
addition, there are additional regulatory constraints for employees under the age of 18, including among others,
with regard to maximum working hours, working times and holiday entitlement.

In April 2016, the UK government announced the introduction of a National Living Wage, which replaced the
national minimum wage for all working people aged 23 and over in the UK. The National Minimum Wage
remained in place for all working people under the age of 22 who are at least school leaving age in the UK. In
April 2021, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the UK to 18 was £4.62 per hour.
At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 22 was £6.56
per hour and £8.36 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 23 and over was
increased to £8.91 per hour. In April 2022, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in
the UK to 18 was increased to £4.81 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18
to 20 and for people aged 21 to 22 was increased to £6.83 per hour and £9.18 per hour, respectively, while the
National Living Wage for people aged 23 and over was increased to £9.50 per hour. In April 2023, the National
Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the UK to 18 was increased to £5.28 per hour. At the same
time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 22 was increased to £7.49
per hour and £10.18 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 23 and over was
increased to £10.42 per hour. As of April 1, 2024, the National Living Wage has increased by 9.8%, from £10.42
to £11.44 per hour for people aged 21 and over. As we employ a large number of staff at the National Minimum
Wage or the National Living Wage, any further increase in the National Minimum Wage or the National Living
Wage, or their scope, could affect our operating costs. Furthermore, we may be required to raise the salaries of
our other employees in order to preserve the pay differential vis à vis our employees who are employed at the
National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage. Any resulting increase in labor costs could, in turn, have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

To the extent our employees are required to wear a uniform, we are required to record their cost as an expense to
ensure that the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, as applicable, is met. In 2023, His
Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) identified numerous employers in the UK that allegedly failed to pay
the correct minimum wage. Charging staff for uniforms and failure to apply correct wage rates were some of the
reasons given by HMRC for salaries falling below the minimum wage threshold. Identified employers, including
us, were required to compensate employees and pay fines against this potential liability. In addition to companies
being required to make compensation payments and pay fines, individuals may be also subject to criminal
prosecution for deliberately not complying with the relevant legislation in relation to minimum wage standards
and anyone found guilty may be disqualified from being a company director for up to 15 years.

**_c._** **_Government legislation, regulation and campaigns in the UK relating to the consumption of alcohol and_**
**_drink-driving laws may reduce demand for our alcoholic drinks._**

In the UK, consumption of alcoholic drinks has become the subject of considerable social and political attention
in recent years due to increasing public concern over adverse health consequences associated with the misuse of
alcohol and alcohol-related social problems, including the impact of drink and obesity related health issues on the
National Health Service budget in the UK, drink- driving, binge drinking and under-age drinking.

The government in the UK periodically imposes measures relating to the consumption of alcohol, including the
reduction of licensing hours, raising the legal drinking age, the introduction of minimum prices for alcoholic

38


-----

drinks and the introduction of a mandatory code imposing certain conditions on all alcohol retailers, such as a ban
on indoor smoking. For example, in 2018, Scotland introduced minimum prices for alcoholic drinks and the Royal
Assembly of Wales has also adopted minimum prices for alcoholic drinks. Any such measures could reduce our
flexibility to implement profitable business strategies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.

As car drivers and passengers account for a significant proportion of pub customers in the UK, further reductions
in the legal blood alcohol limit could result in customers in our rural and suburban pubs drinking less or
frequenting pubs less often, which could lead to a reduction in revenue in those pubs and a decline in our income
from the sale of alcoholic drinks. For example, in 2014, Scotland introduced new legislation which decreased the
legal blood alcohol limit. While such legislation has not had a material impact on our operations, there can be no
assurance that our operations would be similarly unaffected if the UK government were to impose similar
legislation across the rest of the UK. Any change in laws relating to alcohol consumption therefore could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_d._** **_The late-night levy to which we are subject may increase._**

Pursuant to the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 (applicable only in England and Wales),
licensing authorities are authorized to raise a contribution from late-opening alcohol suppliers towards policing
the night-time economy. The licensing authorities also have the power to choose the period during which the levy
applies every night, between midnight and 6 a.m., and decide what exemptions and reductions should apply.
Certain pubs, particularly those operating in urban areas, are open after midnight, and may be subject to “late
night levy” charges, which came into force in October 2012 and was recently amended in July 2023. These annual
charges range between £299 for small premises and £4,440 for larger venues, and are subject to potential increases.

Even though most of our pubs have not yet had such a late-night levy imposed on them, to the extent that individual
licensing authorities decide to exercise their power under the act or the government in the UK decides to increase
these powers, it could result in increased costs for us or our Pub Partners, as the case may be, and consequently
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_e._** **_Our pub operations require licenses, permits and approvals which we may not be able to obtain and/or_**
**_maintain._**

Each of our pubs is licensed for, among other things, the sale of alcoholic drinks. Difficulties or failures in
obtaining or maintaining required licenses or approvals or the withdrawal of such licenses and approvals as a
result of the failure to comply with the terms thereof, including in relation to our late night venues, could delay or
prohibit the operation of our pubs, as could onerous lease provisions limiting the use of our properties.
Furthermore, if we or any of our Pub Partners were to become insolvent, the relevant licenses could lapse and,
under the UK Licensing Act of 2003 (the “UK Licensing Act”), insolvency is defined to include the approval of
a voluntary arrangement proposed by the company’s directors, the appointment of an administrator in respect of
the company, the appointment of an administrative receiver in respect of the company or going into liquidation.
If we or our Pub Partners are unable to maintain the relevant licenses or if we or our Pub Partners face a significant
number of difficulties or failures in obtaining and/or maintaining required licenses or approvals that could delay
or prohibit the operation of our pubs, that could have a material effect on our business, operating results, financial
condition and prospects.

In addition, licensing requirements which affect our pubs are subject to change, and additional or more stringent
requirements may be imposed on our operations in the future. This could result in us or our Pub Partners losing
licenses or having increased operating costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects.

Furthermore, the provision of leisure machines in premises which have the benefit of a premises license is
governed by the Gambling Act 2005. The Gambling Act 2005, as amended by the Gambling (Licensing and
Advertising) Act 2014, includes explicit monetary limits on stakes and prizes and new social responsibility
provisions requiring close supervision of games. Our pubs typically operate under gambling licenses from local
licensing authorities, who have the discretion to terminate licenses that have been granted or otherwise change the
licensing requirements. If our licenses are terminated, or otherwise the licensing requirements are changed, we
could be required to expand significant capital or other resources to comply with the new requirements and/or
could be unable to meet the new requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating
results, financial condition and prospects.

**_f._** **_Initiatives that result in a requirement to include nutritional information on menus, and overall changes_**
**_in the food labeling and safety regulations, could result in additional costs, including compliance costs._**

On April 6, 2022, the UK Government introduced the Calorie Labelling (Out of Home sector) (England)
Regulations 2021 which required businesses with more than 250 employees to display calorie information on nonpackaged food and soft drink menus. These regulations and other future initiatives that result in a requirement for
restaurants, cafes and pubs to display nutritional information on their menus, including for alcoholic drinks and
other related requirements, could give rise to additional compliance costs for us in relation to our Managed and
Operator-run pubs. These changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the
nutritional properties of certain products and expanded or different labeling. Furthermore, such disclosure
requirements increase consumers’ awareness of the nutritional content of our drink and food offerings, which may
result in consumers changing their preferences. Any or all of these requirements and factors could have an adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_g._** **_The taxes and duties to which we are subject may increase._**

Our activities are affected by a number of taxes and duties, such as the duty on alcoholic and certain soft drinks,
value added tax (“VAT”) and other business taxes. Changes in law and practices that affect all or any of these
matters may adversely affect our financial performance. In particular, the government in the UK imposed a duty
escalator which ran from 2009 to 2014, pursuant to which duties on alcohol rise each year by 2% above the rate
of inflation (based on retain price index (“RPI”)). In the March 2016 budget, duty rates on wine and made-wine
at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by volume rose at the
same rate as RPI inflation, but the UK government froze in cash terms the duty rates on beer, spirits and other
drinks above 22% alcohol by volume and still cider and lower strength sparkling cider. In the March 2017 budget,
the duty rates on alcohol manufactured in, or imported into, the UK rose at the same rate as forecast RPI inflation,
and in the November 2017 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders were frozen. In the October
2018 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders remained frozen but specifically duty rates on
wine and made-wine at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol
by volume rose at the same rate as RPI inflation. In 2021, the UK government announced a new alcohol duty rates
system based on alcohol by volume (“ABV”) (replacing the previous system organized by drink classification).
As of August 1, 2023, an increase in applicable alcohol duty rates came into effect under the revised duty structure
for alcohol products in line with RPI inflation. Alcohol duty rates on beer, cider and wine were frozen following
the autumn 2020 budget. In order to provide certainty to businesses, on November 22, 2023, the government
extended the alcohol duty freeze to August 1, 2024, and on March 6, 2024 the government further extended the
alcohol duty freeze to February 1, 2025. Pursuant to the UK government’s assistance to businesses due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, we opted to defer VAT payments due between March 20, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and
repaid in installments between June 2021 and January 2022. In relation to soft drinks, in April 2018 the UK
Government implemented a soft drinks industry levy as part of its initiative to combat obesity, which was recently
revised in April 2023 to broaden the range of relevant beverages subject to the levy. Applicable taxes and duties
could increase and/or similar taxes and duties could be imposed by the government in the UK in the future and
could therefore affect our activities going forward.

To the extent that we do not, or are not able to, pass on any such duty increases to our customers in relation to our
Managed or Operator-run pubs, this could reduce our margins and could consequently have an adverse effect on
our operating results, financial condition and prospects. On the other hand, to the extent that we do pass on duty
increases to our customers in relation to our Managed or Operator-run pubs by way of higher prices, this could
result in decreased demand and consequently could also have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, financial condition and prospects. Further, in relation to our pubs in the Leased and Tenanted segment,
duty increases will typically be absorbed by Pub Partners but, to the extent that we do pass on duty increases to
Pub Partners which results in price increases for their customers, it could result in decreased demand of beer and
other alcohol beverages by publicans’ customers and consequently could also have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_h._** **_We are subject to revaluation of business rates._**

In the UK, the UK government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect changes in the property market
approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation came into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on
April 1, 2023 (based on open market rental values from April 1, 2021). At revaluation, all properties are given a
new ratable value and multiplier which, depending on the underlying movement in the value of the property, can
have a significant impact on the tax liability due on the property. As part of the revaluation, the UK government
increased business rate reliefs for smaller UK businesses (including business rate reliefs for businesses with a

40


-----

ratable value of less than £51,000). On November 22, 2023, the UK government announced that, effective from
April 1, 2024, 75% of the business rates relief in England will be extended for retail, hospitality and leisure sectors
during 2024-2025. In addition, the small business multiplier will be frozen for a fourth consecutive year and the
standard multiplier will be uprated in line with September CPI. Despite the UK government’s efforts to support
small businesses, the UK government may limit such business rates reliefs for larger corporations or to certain
industries, which could increase the monetary burden on some businesses in the UK. Pursuant to the UK
government’s assistance to businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we received a business rate tax holiday
for the tax year 2020-2021 and for the first three months of the 2021 to 2022 tax year. In addition, we paid 34%
of our business rate for the remaining nine months of the 2021 to 2022 tax year, capped at £2 million. However,
any future revaluation adjustments of the business rates, or any changes to the business rates following the UK
government’s annual budget announcements, could result in increased costs in relation to our Managed and
Operator-run pubs and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects. Our business rate payments were £46 million and £23 million for the 52 weeks
ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively.

**_i._** **_Proposed legislation aimed at ensuring better preparedness to face terrorist events, could require_**
**_expansion/reconfiguration of some of our premises and additional compliance costs._**

On May 2, 2023, the UK Government published the draft Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill (“Martyn’s
**Law”) which puts premises owners under a duty to consider the threat from terrorism and implement proportionate**
mitigating measures. Among other categories, Martyn’s Law also applies to premises with a maximum capacity
of over 100 people, which are required to implement certain safety preparedness measures and policies, including
training, information sharing and completion of a preparedness plan to embed practices such as locking doors to
delay attackers progress or knowledge on lifesaving treatments that can be administered by staff whilst awaiting
emergency services. Martyn’s Law is expected to be adopted as law in the coming months, and its implementation
could require us to undertake additional expansion and/or reconfiguration in our premises, and may result in
additional compliance costs to be borne by us.

**_Material uncertainty exists on our Group’s ability to continue as a going concern._**

Our financial statements for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and our condensed consolidated interim
financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The going concern basis contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business, and does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding
our ability to continue as such. See Note 1.2 of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks
ended September 24, 2023 and Note 1.1 of our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as
of and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024.

In relation to our latest review of our going concern position, our base case forecasts are based on, among others
levels of trade in line with the current year, sales price increases below inflation, labor cost rises to ensure we
remain paying at least National Living Wage and certain out of contract cost price increases. As part of its going
concern assessment, the Group’s board also considered severe but plausible downside scenarios, such as a
reduction in retail sales volumes from the cost of living crisis within its Managed and Operator-run segments and
the inability to refinance debt maturing in July 2025. The Group has continued to meet its day-to-day working
capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of cash generation, charging and collecting rents from
publicans and utilizing its Revolving Facilities (including overdraft facility).

Based on these forecasts, we believe it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated interim financial statements as
of and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 on a going concern basis. However, it is currently difficult to assess
how the current economic environment will evolve. If one or more of our assumptions in making our assessment
to report as a going concern are found to be incorrect, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are
unable to continue as such, we would have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which
those assets are carried on our audited consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose a
part or all of their investment in the Notes.

**_Revenue from sales of beer may decline and have a negative effect on our business._**

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of beer to customers and Pub Partners, respectively.
Although there is an increasing consumer demand for craft beers and premium lagers, if revenue from sales of
beer were to decline in the UK and we are not able to develop our income streams from products other than beer,
a decline in the UK beer market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue or our ability to attract

41


-----

customers to our pubs, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Reduction in disposable income of blue collar workers and students in the UK have had, and may continue to_**
**_have, a negative effect on our business._**

Our customer groups include, among others, blue collar workers and students. Changes to the welfare system over
the past years, and the current economic slowdown, including cost of living crisis in the UK, in recent periods,
have had an impact on the disposable income of blue collar workers and students. In particular, high interest rates
and the cost living crisis, has reduced the real value of students loans, and coupled with increases in student tuition
fees for undergraduates and postgraduates, have had an adverse impact on student trade for our pubs. Any future
cuts to welfare spending, high interest rates and the cost living crisis, increases in student tuition fees or other
costs of higher education, or other events that potentially reduce the disposable income of these customer groups
could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_A significant proportion of our pubs operate in town centers, and if consumers increasingly choose alternative_**
**_shopping channels or locations, trade at our pubs could be adversely affected._**

A significant proportion of our Managed and Operator-run pubs are located in town centers, and the day-time
trade of these pubs is reliant on customers visiting town centers for shopping trips. As such, we are exposed to the
risk of consumers increasingly choosing alternative shopping channels or locations, such as online shopping and
out of town retail parks, thereby resulting in a decrease in the number of visitors to town centers and the number
of potential customers at our pubs. This trend may be particularly exacerbated due to changes in consumer trends
following the COVID-19 pandemic. If shoppers continue to migrate away from town centers, this may also
ultimately result in the closure of shopping centers and other outlets located in town centers. This could in turn
lead to town centers becoming vacant and consumers travelling to larger cities for shopping, which could
exacerbate the risk to us. Any continuing trend in migration away from town centers could accordingly have an
adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Subscription prices for broadcasting services relating to major sporting events may increase._**

We have subscription services for Sky TV, TNT Sport, Amazon Prime and other large screen offerings for
broadcasting major sporting events, such as the Premier League, Champions’ League, FA Cup, Rugby World
Cup, Six Nations and the Ashes. Subscription prices for these services may increase and it may become less
profitable to broadcast such events. As of the 2024-25 campaign, Sky TV and TNT Sport are expected to broadcast
128 and 52 Premier League games per season, respectively, and alongside their announcements regarding an
increase in pricing, both content providers are introducing new training tools for licensees and commitments to
expanded programming, all of which is expected to increase costs related to broadcasting sporting events at our
sites. While we regularly consider our large screen offerings, we cannot guarantee that our subscription prices and
related costs will remain at profitable levels. In addition, the market may become more fragmented resulting in
more subscription services being needed. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business,
operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_We may not realize appropriate value from the sale of our pub sites._**

We have implemented a pub disposal program whereby we opportunistically dispose of select pubs or other sites
in our estate, so as to streamline our estate in line with the trading environment and our current business needs. In
particular, we close down and dispose of underperforming pubs, so as rationalize our offering and focus on our
profitable operations. During the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, we
disposed of 86 pub sites and 36 pub sites, respectively. While we seek to dispose of these sites at a premium to
valuation and with a view to maximize the sale proceeds, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to
do so. In recent periods, as a result of inflationary macro-economic conditions, and high interest and mortgages
rates, property markets in the UK have seen a substantial slowdown. A continued downturn in the property market
could lead to a sustained reduction in our asset valuation, a decline in the price at which we may be able to dispose
of individual sites and may generally impact our ability to implement our pub disposal program. For instance, as
of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, we recognized £1 million of net impairment reversal for
property, plant and equipment. There can be no certainty that property values in the UK will recover from the
downturn in the near-term, or at all. In addition, while disposing off the sites, we may grant certain warranties,
indemnities and other contractual protection to purchasers. As a result, we may be subject to claims, liabilities
(including environmental claims and liabilities), disputes and litigation, in respect of such contractual protections

42


-----

given to the purchaser of the sites. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating
results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Future acquisitions may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources._**

To date, we have grown through the acquisition of other businesses, pubs, bars and venues, and we seek to
selectively continue this growth strategy in future. Successful growth through future acquisitions is dependent
upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions
on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired businesses, pubs, bars or
venues into our group. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate expected margins or cash flows,
or to realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies and costs
savings. The expected benefits of these acquisitions, in particular, the anticipated synergies and cost savings, and
growth opportunities, may not be realized in full (or not at all) or may take longer to realize than planned. There
can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding the acquisition targets and/or expected
synergies will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations.

Further, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our group or turn around businesses that
may previously have been insolvent. Such integration or rehabilitation may require more investment than we
expect, and we could incur or assume unknown, unforeseen or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with
respect to customers, employees, suppliers, government authorities or to other parties, which may impact our
operating results. The process of integrating businesses, pubs, bars or venues that we acquire may be disruptive
to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in
our results of operations as a result of difficulties or risks, including unforeseen legal or regulatory issues, such as
in relation to compliance with data protection laws and regulations, as well as contractual and other issues. The
integration of businesses that we acquire are also subject to a number of operational and other risks, which may
be difficult to overcome. These include, difficulty in standardizing information and other systems, difficulty in
realizing operating synergies, diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business, potential loss
of key employees, customers, suppliers and agents and failure to maintain the quality of services that we have
historically provided. Acquired companies or businesses may have different corporate cultures and practices and
we may not be able to successfully assimilate them with our culture and practices, and as a result, may among
others, be unable to retain key employees from such acquisitions. Any of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

Moreover, any acquisition may result in the incurrence of additional debt, which will increase our interest expense.
Instruments used to finance the acquisitions are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our flexibility in
operating our business. The increased financial indebtedness and interest could reduce our profitability and harm
our business.

**_The acquisition agreements entered into in connection with some of our acquisitions may not fully cover us_**
**_against claims and liabilities that may arise in connection with such acquisitions._**

Over the past few years, we have acquired certain pubs pursuant to multiple acquisition transactions. The
warranties and other contractual protections that we have received from the sellers in these acquisitions are limited
and may not be sufficient to fully cover us against claims and liabilities associated with these acquisitions that
may arise in the future. While we have taken into account such potential claims and liabilities when determining
the consideration to be paid under these agreements, we cannot guarantee that we have been able to identify all
claims and liabilities that may arise in respect of these acquisitions. In the event potential claims or liabilities are
greater in amount than we have estimated or above the agreed monetary limit, we may not be covered against
these claims and liabilities by the sellers in these acquisitions.

While we have had an opportunity to inspect each of the pubs that we have acquired upon the successful
assignment to us of certain leases, we cannot guarantee that we have identified any or all material liabilities
relating to each of these pubs and that may cause us to incur losses in the future. Further, under the relevant
acquisition agreements, we may experience delays or other difficulties in enforcing indemnity claims should they
arise and may be required to pay amounts with respect to such claims without reimbursement.

To the extent that the relevant sellers in these acquisitions are liable for damages with respect to such claims, such
liabilities may significantly diminish the value of the assets we have purchased from those sellers. Our limited
ability, under the acquisitions agreements entered into with these sellers to recover losses or damages arising from
these pubs could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Our revenue, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis and are affected by public holidays, the_**
**_timing of major sporting events and weather conditions._**

Footfall at our pubs is impacted by seasonality and is highest during the Christmas period, Easter, bank holiday
weekends and end-of-the-month salary weekends. In addition, footfall at many of these pubs, particularly those
with Sky TV, TNT Sport or other large screen offerings, is affected by major sporting events, such as the World
Cup, Premier League, European Championships, Champions’ League, FA Cup, Rugby World Cup, Six Nations
and The Ashes. British teams’ performance in those events can also have an impact on footfall, which if materially
different from our expectations, could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, if a British team does
not progress beyond the group stages of the World Cup or the European Championship, this generally represents
a lost opportunity in terms of footfall and drinks and food sales at our pubs. In addition, the cancellation or
postponement of sporting events (or the holding of sporting events behind closed doors or with a limited number
of spectators (for instance, during the period impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic), could lead to lower footfall
in our pubs, and thereby a decline in our revenue.

Weather patterns can also affect footfall across our pubs. Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather,
particularly during the summer months, over our peak trading periods or over weekends, adversely affects us.
Certain of our pubs, namely those with terraces or significant outdoor space, are particularly vulnerable to rain
and other bad weather, as the inability to use their outdoor space prevents such pubs from maximizing their trading
capacity.

If revenue during our main trading periods is lower than expected, or if the UK experiences adverse weather
conditions, this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
For a discussion of the impact of seasonal factors on our results of operation, see “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Seasonal Effects.”_

Seasonal fluctuations also impact our inventory, working capital and liquidity levels. We must carry a significant
amount of inventory before the peak selling periods, which is also reflected in our liquidity with a certain time lag
due to the payment terms that we have agreed with our suppliers. If net sales during our peak trading periods are
significantly lower than we expect, we may be unable to adjust our working capital in a timely fashion. Any of
these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

**_An overall rise in interest rates could increase our financing costs and could lead to uncertainty of cash flows._**

In response to increased levels of inflation in major economies around the world, central banks, such as the Bank
of England, European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates or have signaled that they
will or may further raise interest rates in the future. For instance, in December 2021, the Bank of England voted
to increase the base rate to 0.25% in the first increase since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and since
then, has steadily increased the base rate to 5.25% as of May 2024.

We depend upon our operations as well as external borrowings to generate cash flows, including to support our
working capital needs and make capital expenditure. To the extent we use external debt financing at partially
variable interest rates or when refinancing existing fixed rate indebtedness, an increase in interest rates would
directly result in higher financing costs for us, including through higher costs for funding working capital
requirements, requiring further cash outflow for our business. A rise in interest rates may also result in a downward
pressure on the valuations of our assets. To control our interest rate risk we may enter into hedging contracts in
respect of a portion of its interest rate exposure. However, if any counterparty to these hedging contracts is unable
to meet its obligations or if our hedging procedures turn out to be ineffective for other reasons, the interest
expenses incurred by us could be higher than expected. An overall rise of interest rates could therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and
could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

Borrowings under the Euro Notes will bear interest at a variable rate and we will be exposed to the risk of
fluctuations in interest rates. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest
expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our
ability to make payments on the Notes. The Indenture will not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any
portion of our floating rate debt.

**_We rely on a limited number of suppliers and distributors and, if such suppliers continue to consolidate, or_**
**_face financial difficulties, prices we pay to our suppliers may rise or our operations may be disrupted._**

The brewing and distribution industry in the UK has seen a movement towards consolidation in recent years,
which reduces the number of suppliers and distributors available to us and may have the effect of raising prices
that we pay. We rely on an increasingly limited number of major brewing companies for the supply of beer and
other drink products, with our leading suppliers during the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 being Heineken UK,
Molson Coors (UK), Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited, Diageo, Carlsberg and LWC Drinks. We also enter into
distribution arrangements with some of our suppliers. In addition, our drinks supply contracts must be renewed
from time to time. While we negotiate contract renewals where desirable, we cannot guarantee that we will be
successful in obtaining renewals of our existing contracts with our suppliers on the same or similar terms, or at
all. Failure to timely agree renewals with our suppliers and distributors, termination of these agreements or a
variation of its terms could cause distribution or supply disruptions and could increase costs if we are required to
find alternative suppliers and distributors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, we primarily source our food supply from a single supplier. If the trend in consolidation in the brewing
and distribution industry were to continue, this could further increase our reliance on a limited number of suppliers
and distributors and, therefore we would continue to be subject to their bargaining power, which could have the
effect of increasing the prices we pay for our supplies. Furthermore, if our suppliers and distributors face financial
difficulties, including due to the current economic environment and increasing inflationary pressure, fail to deliver
the agreed level of service, we could encounter difficulties replacing these suppliers, which could result in
disruptions to our business and/or significant costs being incurred. Moreover, any disaster in our head office could
seriously disrupt our daily operations. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, operating
results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Leasing and ownership of a significant portfolio of real estate exposes us to possible impairments, liabilities_**
**_and losses._**

As a result of inflationary macro-economic conditions and high interest and mortgages rates, property markets in
the UK have seen a substantial slowdown in recent periods. A continued downturn in the property market could
lead to a sustained reduction in our freehold and leasehold property values over time, which may impact our
business. For example, for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2023, we recognized £1 million of net impairment
reversal for property, plant and equipment. There can be no certainty that property values will recover from the
downturn in the near-term, or at all. Moreover, all property valuations have a degree of subjectivity, made on the
basis of assumptions that may not reflect the true position of such property. There is no assurance that the
valuations of our property portfolio will reflect actual sale prices or that there will be sufficient demand or
available buyers to sell any of our assets at the right value or at all. We can provide no assurance that a material
impairment loss of assets will not occur in future periods, and the risk of future material impairments has been
significantly heightened as result of the effects of the current downturn in the global economic landscape on our
business. Further impairment losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition and our ability to secure financing.

Approximately 17% of our property portfolio (based on number of sites) was short leasehold as of April 7, 2024.
In addition, we have a number of commercial non-pub properties or areas used for purposes ancillary to pubs
(such as car parks or gardens) where the associated pub is held freehold, but the non-pub property is either wholly
or partly under a leasehold title (together with our leasehold pubs, the “Leasehold Properties”). Our short
leaseholds have unexpired lease terms of less than 50 years and are subject to periodic rent reviews and
renegotiation of rents when leases are renewed. Rents may increase such that they affect the economic viability
of one or more of such properties. Further, as leases underlying our pubs, bars or venues expire, we may be unable
to negotiate a new lease or lease extension, either on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause
us to close our pubs in desirable locations. As a result, our sales and our brand building initiatives could be
adversely affected.

Furthermore, we are generally not entitled to cancel leases, and if an existing or future pub is not profitable, and
we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease,
including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Also, in case of some of our
leasehold properties, the landlord may have an option to break the lease with no compensation payable to us. If
any such options were exercised, we may be deprived of the capital value in the relevant leasehold properties as
well as ongoing income. Moreover, a majority of our leasehold properties contain forfeiture provisions pursuant
to which the landlord may terminate the lease upon the insolvency of the tenant. The termination of any such lease

45


-----

by a landlord could deprive us of any capital value in the relevant leasehold interest as well as the ongoing income
from the relevant property. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, financial condition and prospects.

Additionally, certain of our leasehold properties are or may in the future become subject to disputed claims
between us and the landlords of those leasehold properties. For example, under certain of our lease agreements
landlords can, and occasionally do, challenge the permissibility of the uses to which we put the properties subject
to those leases, and in some cases our landlords may be required to provide consent before we are able to make
changes to the formats at certain of our leasehold pubs. In addition, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic we have
incurred costs related to renegotiating our terms with landlords (including £1 million of COVID-19-related
landlord renegotiation costs for each of the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and 52 weeks ended September
26, 2021). Our inability to successfully resolve disputes between us and the landlords of the leasehold pubs that
we own or operate could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
conditions and prospects.

Furthermore, some of our Leased and Tenanted properties are and may continue to be subject to restrictive
covenants or title conditions that for example limit the sale of alcohol on the premises, prohibit their operation as
a pub or only allow use of the property for residential purposes. We have been operating pubs on several premises
that are subject to such covenants and may, as a result, be in breach of these covenants, although we have not
faced challenge on these grounds so far, however, a successful claim by a party claiming the benefit of such a
covenant or condition might result in the cessation of the current use and frustration of the relevant occupational
lease and could limit our ability to dispose of or re-let the relevant property. While insurance can be taken out to
address these risks, there can be no assurance that we will have taken out title indemnity insurance in respect of
the breach of those covenants or conditions.

Moreover, our lease agreements typically contain covenants relating to the repair and condition of the property.
We do not review the state of repair or condition of our pubs on a regular basis and may, from time to time, be in
breach of these covenants. Moreover, our landlords may require us to carry out works to our properties in order
to maintain them to the standard required by the lease at any time during the term of the lease and also at the end
of the lease. Furthermore, where the interest held in a property is comprised either wholly or partly under a
leasehold title and that property is damaged or destroyed such that business cannot be operated from that property
until rebuilding or repair work is undertaken, the landlord may have a right to break the lease if the property cannot
be rebuilt within a certain period. In addition, in respect of both freehold and the Leasehold Properties, there can
be no assurances that the property can be rebuilt within a certain specified period. In such circumstances, our
operational tenants may cease to operate their business at the relevant freehold or leasehold properties because (i)
it is not viable for them to wait for rebuilding or repair; or (ii) they may wish to continue to operate from an
alternative site and then chooses not to return; or (iii) they may lose their license to operate. Thus, such damage
or destruction could deprive us of cash flow of capital value in the relevant freehold or leasehold properties and/or
ongoing income from operational tenants.

Additionally, a small number of our properties have uncertain title, as a result of which either our or our landlords’
ability to own the freeholds or leaseholds, respectively, to those properties can potentially be challenged. If, due
to these reasons, we are unable to continue to occupy and operate certain of our pubs, that could result in a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Property valuations are inherently subjective and uncertain and are based on assumptions which may prove to_**
**_be inaccurate._**

Property valuations are inherently subjective, uncertain and based on assumptions which may prove to be
inaccurate. We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed
in the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete. As a
result, the valuation report presents the external valuer’s best estimate of the value of the Group’s, the Stonegate
Group’s and the Unique Group’s properties, as applicable.

This Offering Memorandum refers to and presents certain metrics from Avison Young Valuation Reports with
respect to the real estate portfolio owned by the Group, the Stonegate Group and the Unique Group, prepared in
accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Global Standards, effective
from January 31, 2022. See “Presentation of Financial and other Information—Valuation—Avison Young
_Valuation Reports.” Valuation of property and property-related assets is inherently subjective and uncertain, in_
part because all property valuations are made on the basis of information and assumptions which may not prove
to be accurate, and in part because of the individual nature of each property. Property valuations are complex,

46


-----

involve the use of data which is not publicly available and involve a degree of subjective professional judgement
by the valuers. In valuing properties, the valuers are required to make certain key assumptions in respect of matters
including, but not limited to, the existence of willing buyers, title to the property, condition of structure and
services, deleterious materials, environmental matters, legal matters, statutory and regulatory requirements and
planning, estimated market rental values, market-based yields, expected future rental revenues from the property,
where relevant potential future trading performance, and other factors.

The adoption of different assumptions would be likely to produce different valuation results. The assumptions
made may prove to be inaccurate or not borne out by future events and could negatively affect the valuation of
the properties.

We cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in the
Avison Young Valuation Reports are correct, accurate or complete. Avison Young provided its valuation of the
relevant properties as of the valuation date of September 24, 2023 and it does not take into account subsequent
events. Accordingly, the information included in the Avison Young Valuation Reports may not reflect the current
physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the property portfolio. Avison Young
have accepted no responsibility to any third party for the whole or any part of the contents of the Avison Young
Valuation Reports.

Other appraisers may reach a different valuation of our, Stonegate Group’s or the Unique Group’s property
portfolio. Moreover, the values determined in the Avison Young Valuation Reports could be significantly higher
than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of any such properties, individually or in the
aggregate, for instance in a distressed or liquidation scenario or in the event of a downturn in the local, regional
or national real estate market. Accordingly, the Avison Young Valuation Reports should not be considered a
representation of the actual present or future value of our, Stonegate Group’s or the Unique Group’s property
portfolio. The realizable value of the applicable property portfolio at any given time will depend on various factors,
many of which are outside of our control, will change over time, and may change materially. As our business
depends in part on valuation of our properties, inaccurate valuations could result in us not being able to achieve
our expected yield, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_The rent determination and review arrangements in lease and tenancy agreements can lead to decreased rents._**

Some of our Leased and Tenanted pub leases contain open market rent review provisions. It is possible that rents
from these pubs could decrease if the open market rental value at the time of review is less than the passing rent
then payable. Moreover, regardless of the terms of the relevant rent review provision, we may agree to lower the
rent payable, as appropriate, in light of economic or other circumstances. For example, as part of our package of
support provided to our Pub Partners during the COVID-19 pandemic, we agreed to significant rent concessions,
which led to a material reduction in rental income. We may be required to offer similar support to maintain the
health of our Pub Partners and our broader business interests in the future. In addition, considering the current
macro-economic environment, pressures on operating cost of pubs and cost of living crisis, at the time renewing
lease agreement with our existing Pub Partners or entering into fresh lease agreements with new Pub Partners, we
may agree to lower the rent payable. In addition, some of our Leased and Tenanted tenancy agreements and leases
also provide for annual rent reviews by reference to negative movements in the RPI or the CPI. A negative RPI
or CPI in the future would reduce the rents payable in respect of those pubs. Any of the foregoing developments
could decrease our revenues which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_We do not control the operations of our Leased and Tenanted pubs and may not be able to optimize our share_**
**_of the profit from such properties._**

Our Leased and Tenanted pubs are let to tenants who operate the properties as their own businesses, subject to the
terms of their leases or tenancy agreements. Because, a substantial portion of our revenues derive from rent and
revenues from the provision of beer and other drink products to our Pub Partners, declining sales and pub failures
as a result of factors over which we have no direct control, such as poor pub management, poor or declining food
quality and safety, ineffective marketing, changing local demographic trends or otherwise as a consequence of,
amongst other factors, the current economic climate may result in a decline in our operating results. In addition,
Pub Partners may buy beer and other drink products from other suppliers or tamper with equipment monitoring
the flow of draught beverages in contravention of their tied agreements with us, and enforcement of such
agreements may not be effective. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, financial condition and prospects.

47


-----

**_Licensees may fail to pay amounts due promptly or at all._**

There is a general risk that rental and other payments owing to us from publicans (including, for example, for the
supply of beer) will not be paid on the due date or will not be paid at all. This is exacerbated by the financial
challenges faced by our publicans as a consequence of current downturn in the global economic environment and,
in particular, inflationary pressures on cost base and volatile energy prices. A sufficient aggregation of such late
or non-payments would affect our profitability. Continued failure by a particular publican to pay rental and other
payments due to us will usually result in the termination of the publican’s lease and either the closure of the pub
or business or our leasing to a new publican. Where a pub is leased to a new publican, there may also be a period
following the departure of the former publican during which cash flow to us is reduced. The relevant property
may also become vacant which would reduce revenue and our ability to recover certain operating costs (which
would result in us incurring additional expenses until the property is re-let). In addition, the rent and other
payments payable by the replacement publican may not be as high as those paid by the former publican. These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Our ability to manage our properties could be frustrated by compulsory purchase orders._**

Any property in England and Wales could at any time be acquired, among others, by a local authority or
government department, generally in connection with proposed redevelopment or infrastructure projects. In the
event of a compulsory purchase order being made in respect of a property, compensation would be payable on the
basis of the open market value of all owners’ and publicans’ proprietary interests in that property at the time of
the related purchase. However, the amount received from the proceeds of compulsory purchase of the relevant
freehold could be inadequate to cover the loss of cash flow from such property. Further, there is often a delay
between the compulsory purchase of a property and the payment of compensation, largely dependent upon the
ability of the property owner and the entity acquiring the property to agree on the open market value.

Any delay in our receipt of funds from a compulsory purchase could have an adverse impact on our revenues or
affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Negative publicity relating to one of our pubs or brands could reduce revenue at some or all of our pubs._**

Although our pubs do not operate under a single brand, we may, from time to time, be subject to negative publicity
relating to alcohol consumption or quality, food quality, bar facilities, pricing initiatives, compliance with health
and safety regulations, health inspection scores, employee or tenant relationships, food contamination, alcoholrelated violence or other matters at one or more of our pubs. In particular, given the overall macro-economic
environment, our pricing initiatives may receive negative publicity.

The rise of online news reporting, discussion forums and social media has increased the risk to brands of attracting
negative publicity given the ease and speed with which such information is disseminated. We are particularly
susceptible to such risks given the high degree of engagement with social media by certain of our key customer
groups such as the student population. Adverse publicity may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the
allegations are valid, whether they are limited to a single pub or whether we are at fault. Furthermore, many of
our pubs operate leisure machines, and any negative publicity in relation to gambling by minors, the use of leisure
machines in pubs and other concerns with the gambling industry, even if not directly connected to us, may
adversely impact our pubs. In addition, a health and safety accident or incident at a property owned or leased by
us that may lead to serious injury or even loss of life, could significantly affect our reputation.

The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one of our pubs may extend far beyond the pub involved to
affect some or all of our other pubs, as such impact may affect the public’s perception of the pub business in
general and/or negatively affect our reputation in the pub industry, especially amongst potential publicans who
are interested in partnering with us. In addition, restoring image and reputation of our business may be costly and
time consuming. The occurrence of such incidents could have a negative impact on our business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects.

**_Further consolidation in the pub industry, or a decline in the rate of closure of pubs without a consummate_**
**_increase in consumer demand, may have an adverse impact on us._**

The pub industry in the UK has undergone periods of consolidation through joint ventures, mergers and
acquisitions. In connection with further consolidation, competitors could also reinvigorate and/or modernize older
pubs, which could negatively affect our consumer attendance. In addition, any future consolidation in the brewing
and distribution industry could force us to rely on a limited number of suppliers, and consequently, those suppliers

48


-----

may be able to exert pressures on us that could increase the prices we pay for our supplies. Therefore, if we cannot
continue to be a major participant in the pub industry in the UK, we may not be able to secure favorable pricing
from suppliers or attract, or retain suitable employees and managers to operate and manage our Managed pubs or
retain or attract suitable Pub Partners for our pubs in the Leased and Tenanted segment, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

The pub sector in the UK has historically been overcrowded with a number of unprofitable sites. As unprofitable
sites exit the market and the remaining profitable estates, such as our estate, win customer and revenue shares
from those that have exited, resulting in a more balanced market. However, there is no assurance that this trend
will continue. A slowdown in the closure of pubs in the sector, without a consummate rise (or stabilization) in
general customer demand, may lead to an overall decline in profitability in the sector as well as reduced average
volume per pub, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Failure to ensure our business and assets are climate resilient may adversely affect our business._**

A failure to ensure our business is climate resilient presents risks if we are not able to successfully manage the
impacts of climate change. Physical effects of climate change such as increases in temperature, sea levels, the
severity of weather events and the frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes,
wildfires, floods and earthquakes, among other effects, could result in physical damage or a decrease in the value
of our assets. Such severe weather conditions and force majeure events could also have a negative impact on
consumer’s willingness and ability to frequent pubs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, financial condition and prospects. In the worse cases, such properties could even be damaged
beyond repair as a result of such natural disasters. The costs of remediating or repairing such damage, or of
investments made in advance of such weather events to minimize potential damage, could be considerable.
Additionally, such actual or threatened climate change related damage could increase the cost of, or make
unavailable, insurance on favorable terms. While we take steps to mitigate such impacts, including investing in
our assets to protect from future impact of climate change and insuring our assets with appropriate and available
insurance, there is a risk that there may be events that arise which are unforeseen or are not covered by insurance.
If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover
business interruption or losses from these events, our results of operations, financial condition or capital resources
could be adversely affected.

The materialization of any or all of the foregoing risks may therefore have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Disease outbreaks, incidents of food or drink contamination, including a serious contamination or threat of_**
**_contamination, could adversely affect our reputation and result in financial loss._**

We are susceptible to risks relating to disease outbreaks (including incidents of salmonella, E. coli, “H1N1”, other
airborne diseases and the COVID-19 virus or variants thereof), which can affect consumer confidence and
preferences, resulting in lower footfall or expenditure at our pubs.

We are also susceptible to food and drink contamination, including in relation to issues involving integrity and
traceability of food supplies. Any such contamination could lead to increased costs for our Managed pubs, and, in
seeking to address the contamination, we may be required to procure supplies from alternative suppliers or source
alternate products. A serious contamination or threat of contamination at one of our Managed pubs, bars or venues
could also negatively affect the reputation of one or more of our managed brands. Further, if there is an issue in
our food supply chain, including the provision of incorrect allergen information, that leads to serious illness or
loss of life of one of our customers this could lead to restrictions in supply, potential increases in the cost of goods
and reduced sales.

We adopt and maintain rigorous health and safety policies. However, given the degree of access members of the
public have to our premises, our health and safety policies may not be able to prevent a serious health and safety
incident from occurring on our premises, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and, as a result, on
our operating results, financial condition and prospects. The occurrence of a serious health and safety incident at
one of our Managed pubs, bars or venues could also negatively affect the reputation of one or more of our brands.

Furthermore, health and safety incidents, or contamination issues may from time to time result in our becoming
subject to various claims and legal actions. No assurance can be given that we will not experience actual losses in
connection with these legal actions or that new disputes will not arise under which we could face additional

49


-----

liabilities and reputational risk. Further, if incidents involving the abuse of alcohol, use of illegal drugs and
violence continue to occur or increase in frequency on our premises, it may directly interrupt our operations and
could result in litigation or regulatory action or have an impact on our reputation. Any of the foregoing factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are dependent on key executives for our future success._**

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continuing service and performance of key executives and
our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled senior management. The current directors and members
of our management team may not remain with us. Our failure to retain or recruit suitable replacements for any of
our directors, the management team or significant numbers of other key employees could have an adverse effect
on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_We could be liable for environmental compliance costs at our properties._**

We may be liable for a number of environmental compliance costs in relation to our Managed Pubs, such as costs
relating to recycling (for example, recycling of our used cooking oil), waste disposal and the transition to net zero
emissions. In addition, we may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of hazardous or
toxic substances, including asbestos, on or in a property owned or leased by us. The costs of any required removal,
investigation or remediation of such substances may be substantial thus, if we were found to be liable for the costs
arising from any of these or other obligations or if publicans were unable to meet their rental payments as a result
of such obligations (including fines for non-compliance), our revenue could be adversely affected. The presence
of such substances or the failure to remediate such substances properly, may also adversely affect our ability to
sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as security. Changes in law or regulation may impose
further liabilities on us which may also form the basis of liability to third persons for personal injury or other
damages. In addition, changes in legislation and regulations on climate change could result in increased utility
expenses and/or increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our assets or other related
aspects of our assets in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change. Compliance
with new laws or regulations relating to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes or any
carbon reduction regulation, may require us to make improvements to our existing assets or result in increased
operating costs that we may not be able to effectively pass on to our tenants.

Furthermore, any publicity surrounding environmental liabilities could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing
factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
See “Business—Environmental Matters.” Changes in law or regulation may impose further responsibilities on us,
which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_We may need to increase contributions to cover deficits with respect to our pension schemes._**

The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group
Pension scheme (each a “Group Pension Scheme” and together, the “Group Pension Schemes”). These are both
closed to new entrants. As of September 24, 2023, the present value of funded defined benefit obligations was
£61 million, across both schemes, calculated on an IAS 19 basis. In addition, the deficit in respect of the Group
Pension Schemes as of April 7, 2024 was £7 million.

There are many risks arising from the operation of the Group Pension Schemes. The pensions regulator in the UK
(the “Pensions Regulator”), for instance, may impose a scheme funding target and employer contribution rate, if
those matters cannot be agreed between the scheme trustees and the relevant employers. In addition, the trustees
of either Group Pension Scheme may wind up the relevant scheme, as permitted in certain circumstances. The
Pensions Regulator also has statutory power to order a pension scheme to be wound up. Winding up the schemes
would result in a statutory obligation on the various participating employers to fund the schemes by reference to
a “buyout basis” (which represents the estimated cost of securing members’ benefits by purchasing annuity
policies from an insurance company). The Pensions Regulator may require funding or funding guarantees from
our members (in the form of a contribution notice or financial support direction) for defined benefit pension
schemes in various circumstances. In addition, the trustees of the Group Pension Schemes may alter the investment
profile of the relevant scheme. For example, the trustee could exchange equity investments for lower risk
investments such as bonds, which would typically increase the employer funding obligations in relation to the
schemes because of the lower rate of return expected from lower risk investments.

The foregoing risks are linked to the funding level of the Group Pension Schemes, which may be adversely
affected by a number of factors, including: (i) reducing bond yields (since lower yields mean a pension obligation

50


-----

is assessed as having a higher value); (ii) increasing life expectancy (which will make pensions payable for longer
and, therefore, more expensive to provide); (iii) investment returns failing to meet expectations; (iv) actual and
expected price inflation, subject to the limits set out in the Pension Schemes’ governing documentation; (v)
funding volatility as a result of any mismatch between the assets held and the assets by reference to which the
scheme liabilities are calculated; and (vi) other events occurring which make past service benefits more expensive
than anticipated in the actuarial assumptions by reference to which past pension contributions were assessed,
including unanticipated changes to tax or other legislation.

**_Our insurance may be insufficient and certain types of loss may be uninsurable._**

Although insurance policies held or maintained by us cover such risks as material damage, business interruption,
loss of rent and third party liability, there is a risk that our properties could suffer damage so extensive that it is
not fully covered by our insurance. Moreover, certain types of risk are not fully covered by insurance, such as
business interruptions caused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, among others, due to disagreement with our
insurers as to the claim amount. For instance, we initiated legal proceedings against our insurers for recovery in
light of the closure of our pubs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, we entered into a settlement
agreement with our insurers and have recovered a total amount of £54.5 million in respect of our insurance claim,
which represents only a portion of the loss of revenue we suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If an uninsured loss (or a loss above the level of our insurance coverage) occurs at one or more of our properties,
we could lose all or a portion of the capital we had invested in, as well as any anticipated future revenue from,
such properties. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage caused by uninsured risks, and could remain
liable for any debt or other financial obligation related to those properties. As a result of the nature of our business,
we are also exposed to the risk of other health and safety incidents, for example, accidents occurring on our
premises. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition
and prospects.

**_Computer or information system breakdowns could impair our ability to conduct our business._**

Information technology (“IT”) systems are used extensively in our business, including for our ordering systems,
stocking activities, logistics, financial reporting, management of systems monitoring performance, and by our
employees working remotely. Our operations therefore depend on the continued and uninterrupted functioning of
our IT systems. The centralization of many aspects of our operations, such as purchasing, marketing, property,
finance, human resources and IT, to a certain extent make such functions more vulnerable to a catastrophic failure
at the site or sites at which the IT systems underlying such functions are physically located.

If any of our IT systems were to be disabled or were to malfunction or cease operating properly or as designed,
including as a result of computer security breaches, computer viruses, problems with the internet or sabotage, we
could suffer disruption to our business and supply chains, regulatory intervention, reputational damage or incur
liability to retailers or customers or experience loss of data. Further, there is a risk that inadequate disaster recovery
plans and information security processes are in place to mitigate against a system outage, or failure to ensure
appropriate back-up facilities (covering key business systems and the recovery of critical data) and loss of
sensitive data. This could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct our business which, in turn, could
have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, our online presence, the quantity of customer and employee information held by us, and remote
working and increase in employee health data being processed by us, means that we are in possession of personal
data and must therefore comply with strict data protection and privacy laws and regulations such as the General
Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) including as it forms part of UK law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “GDPR”).

**_We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, which could harm the value of our brands_**
**_and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects._**

We depend in large part on our brands and believe that they are very important to our business, particularly in the
context of our Slug and Lettuce format. We rely on our trademarks to protect our brands. The success of our
business depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to increase brand
awareness. Although we have registered the brand names for our key pubs, trademarks and logos that distinguish
our pubs for trademark protection in the UK, these actions may be inadequate to prevent imitation of our brands
and concepts by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by
us. In addition, intellectual property registrations must be continually renewed and failure to do so could see

51


-----

protection for such intellectual property lapse. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property prove to be
inadequate, the value of our brands could be harmed, which could adversely affect our business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects.

**_A significant portion of our business activities is transacted in cash and our internal controls in relation to_**
**_cash management may not be sufficient to address all the risks associated with the handling of cash and cash_**
**_transactions._**

Due to the nature of our business, a significant proportion of our revenue is collected in cash across our Managed
and Operator-run pubs, which exposes us to potential cash loss. Although we have an internal audit department
which maintains a comprehensive cash handling policy and aims to ensure there is minimal cash leakage out of
the business, our internal controls in relation to cash management may not be sufficient to address all the risks
associated with the handling of cash and cash transactions. We may therefore be exposed to risks such as loss,
theft, misappropriation and forgery of the cash used in the transactions in our Managed or Operator-run pubs. In
the event such risks materialize, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects may be
materially and adversely affected.

**_We are subject to cybersecurity risks, and a cyber-incident could occur and result in information theft, data_**
**_corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss._**

Given we are a technologically enabled company and hold a large amount of sensitive and potentially valuable
customer information, we may be subject to cyberattack. In our ordinary course of business, we collect personal
information, which could be subject to a breach of security. Unauthorized access, loss or disclosure of this
information may lead to legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption of operations and reputational damage.

Increased reliance on technology carries with it an increased risk of cybersecurity issues, including phishing and
end point vulnerability. Such an attack could take a variety of forms, for example, a denial of service/mass attack,
penetration of network access in one of our sites or hacking into our network in our offices. Successful penetration
of our defenses against cyberattack could lead to the loss of customer data and the direct costs associated with this
as well as broader reputational damage.

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. These
threats may arise from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to alleged statesponsored attacks. A cyberattack may be generic, or it may be custom-crafted to target the specific information
technology used by us. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an
extended period. Our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. If, as a result of
such cyberattack, our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way,
we could damage our reputation and may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_A failure to comply with data protection laws and regulation could adversely affect our reputation and result_**
**_in adverse regulatory and financial consequences including fines and penalties._**

Data protection laws and regulations have increased in recent years. The GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act
2018 significantly change the data protection landscape in the UK. Such laws and regulations strengthen the rights
of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and
processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims
for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow
privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a
substantial increase in claims being brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased
obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in
the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification
processes with associated response plans. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is
relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in
the future into supplier contracts, employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be
compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations.

If a significant or widely publicized unlawful disclosure of supplier, employee or customer data were to occur,
whether as a result of a cyber-attack, the failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence, the actions of
our suppliers or otherwise, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines or other enforcement action
which could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences and could harm our reputation. A failure to

52


-----

comply with applicable data protection laws and regulation may subject us to fines and penalties which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in_**
**_the normal course of our business could reduce our cash flow, harm our financial position and limit our ability_**
**_to operate our business._**

We have been and, from time to time, may continue to become a party to claims and lawsuits incidental to the
ordinary course of business. For example, in February 2018, a customer who was queuing to enter one of our
venues died due to an incident involving a crowd surge and perimeter barrier collapse outside our venue, for which
we were found guilty of breach of the Health and Safety Regulations Act and were fined £1.56 million.
Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including current or former customers
who visit our pubs, employees, investors or regulators and litigants of previously acquired businesses. If any of
the proceedings against us were to be determined adversely to us, and consequently a settlement involving a
payment of a material sum of money were to occur, or criminal fines or penalties were to be imposed, there could
be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as a negative effect on
our reputation. We may also become subject to enforcement actions or claims for personal injury under
environmental regulations, such as the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 and the Regulatory Reform (Fire
Safety) Order 2005, which could result in significant fines and penalties. See “Business—Environmental Matters.”
We may also be at risk of employment-related claims with regards to both our Managed pub employees and pub
support staff. Any significant adverse litigation judgments or settlements would reduce our cash flow and harm
our financial position and could limit our ability to operate our business and adversely affect our reputation.

**_The adjustments to our Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and certain other adjusted financial_**
**_information in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment_**
**_decision._**

This Offering Memorandum presents certain adjustments to Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks
ended April 7, 2024 to calculate our Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended April
7, 2024. These adjustments are based on certain assumptions. For example, we have made an aggregate adjustment
of £31 million for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024, which represents the estimated additional revenue from an
increase in price of drinks supplied to our Pub Partners or sold at our Managed and Operator-run Pubs as if we
had implemented such price increases throughout the period between April 2023 and April 2024 effective April
10, 2023. In calculating the additional revenue from such price increases, we have assumed a decline in volumes
purchased. See also Note 10 of “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and other Information.”

Any cost savings that we believe we can realize are based on our past experience and certain assumptions that we
believe are reasonable. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate
or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the period presented or any future period,
and may not be comparable to our historical consolidated financial statements or the other financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, it should be treated with caution when making an
investment decision. If we are unable to realize our estimated cost savings, or achieve estimated EBITDA-based
increases based on our other assumptions, or if the costs in achieving these projected EBITDA-based increases
are significantly higher than our current estimates, that may cause our actual financial performance to differ
significantly from that implied by the Stonegate Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering
Memorandum, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition or prospects. In addition, we present certain adjusted financial information in this Offering
Memorandum which is designed to present a view of certain select metrics after giving effect to the Transactions.

**_The unaudited current trading data included herein need to be carefully considered and that may differ from_**
**_actual results._**

This Offering Memorandum incorporates current trading data for the twelve-week period ended June 30, 2024
and the first two weeks of the fourth quarter ending September 29, 2024, in each case, as derived from our
preliminary operating data and management accounts, which have not been and will not be audited or reviewed
in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards and are subject to change. The current trading data
for the twelve-week period ending June 30, 2024 and the first two weeks of the fourth quarter ending September
29, 2024 presented herein is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results

as interim or year-end financial information. Furthermore, management accounts may not provide for closing

**_Terrorist attacks, war, and threats of attacks and war may materially and adversely affect consumer spending,_**
**_and in turn, our financial condition, financial returns and results of operation._**

Terrorist attacks in the UK and abroad, as well as war and threats of war or actual conflicts involving the UK or
other countries, may dramatically and adversely impact the economy of the UK and cause consumer confidence
and spending to decrease. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, financial condition and prospects.

**_Economic substance legislation of the Cayman Islands may adversely impact us or our operations._**

The Cayman Islands, together with several other non-European Union jurisdictions, have introduced legislation
aimed at addressing concerns raised by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD)
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative as to offshore structures engaged in certain activities which
attract profits without real economic activity. The International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (as
revised, the “Economic Substance Act”) contains economic substance requirements for in-scope Cayman Islands
entities (the “relevant entities”) which are engaged in certain “relevant activities.” As Parent (and some of the
Guarantors) is a Cayman Islands company, its compliance obligations will include filing an annual notification,
which needs to state whether it is a relevant entity which is carrying out any relevant activities and if so, whether
it has satisfied economic substance tests to the extent required under the Economic Substance Act. If the Cayman
Islands Tax Information Authority determines that Parent or any of its Cayman Islands subsidiaries has failed to
meet the requirements imposed by the Economic Substance Act, Parent or the relevant subsidiary may face
significant financial penalties, personal liability in relation to relevant persons and/or be struck off in the Cayman
Islands.

The Economic Substance Act and associated guidance may continue to evolve over time and may be subject to
further clarification and amendments. Parent may need to allocate additional resources to keep updated with these
developments and may have to make changes to its operations in order to comply with all requirements under the
Economic Substance Act. Failure to satisfy these requirements may also subject Parent to penalties under the
Economic Substance Act.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of April 7, 2024, after
giving effect to the Transactions (including the issuance of the Notes, and the application of the proceeds
therefrom, as applicable), Stonegate Group would have had total adjusted third-party debt of £2,521 million
(excluding a lease liability of £658 million as of April 7, 2024, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16). See
“Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

  - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

  - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
interest and any amortization costs on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow
to fund the payment of principal of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

54


-----

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not
as highly leveraged; and

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our high level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which_**
**_could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture, the Revolving
Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement (if
entered into) contain, or will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount
of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. Furthermore, the
Platinum Group is, or on the Issue Date will be, as applicable, designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Unrestricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and
engage in other activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may not engage. See “Description of the Notes.”
Additionally, the Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement do not
prevent us from incurring obligations that would not constitute indebtedness under these agreements.

**_The debt under the Euro Notes, the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement_**
**_bear interest at a floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and reducing_**
**_our cash flow._**

Borrowings under the Euro Notes, Revolving Facilities and the Second Lien Facility bear interest at floating rates
of interest per annum equal to SONIA or EURIBOR, as applicable, plus an agreed margin. SONIA and EURIBOR
could rise significantly in the future. Although we have entered into and maintain, and in the future may enter
into, certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging
will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that
we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent
interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the Euro Notes and debt under our
Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement would correspondingly increase, thus
reducing cash flow.

Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under
the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to SONIA) may: (i) discourage market participants from
continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or SONIA); (ii) trigger
changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark.
Any proposal to cease the determination or publication of SONIA, EURIBOR or any other benchmark, changes
in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could
result in changes to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment
to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any
of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals
for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which
could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to that benchmark
and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, reducing cash flows otherwise
available for our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and servicing our debt obligations, including the
Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Sponsor
Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into) restrict, or will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

  - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock;

55


-----

  - make investments or other restricted payments;

  - enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

  - transfer or sell assets;

  - engage in transactions with affiliates;

  - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

  - impair security interests; and

  - merge or consolidate with or into another company.

The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs
and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. All of these limitations
are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.

For the restrictions that are included in the Indenture, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” For the
restrictions that are included in the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the
agreements governing the Unique Securitized Notes and the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, see
“Description of Other Indebtedness.” A breach of covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions contained in these
agreements could result in an event of default under these agreements. In particular, upon the occurrence of any
event of default under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or the agreements
governing the Unique Securitized Notes and the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement or the Sponsor
Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into), subject to any applicable cure periods and other limitations on
acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the relevant facilities and elect
to declare all amounts outstanding under the relevant facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due
and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility
Agreement or the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into) could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the
Indenture. If our creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that
our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other
liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the
Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against
any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

We are also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the Revolving Facilities Agreement. In particular,
the Revolving Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with a financial covenant to maintain our consolidated
leverage ratio for each period of twelve months ending on any quarter date if utilizations thereunder exceed a
certain threshold. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet
these covenants and restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we
will meet them.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate_**
**_sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures,
will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some
extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are
beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods
of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due. We also
experience seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow. Attendance levels at our pubs are affected by the weather and
by the timing of major sporting events. Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather, especially during the
summer months or over our peak trading periods such as the Christmas period, Easter, bank holidays in the UK
and end-of-the-month salary weekends, can have a negative effect on our cash flow. The absence of major sporting
events, or the poor performance of a British team, could have a negative impact on our cash position, which could
impact our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures.

56


-----

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that revenue growth,
currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity
financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the
Notes or to fund our other liquidity needs.

In addition, we are subject to certain limitations under the agreements governing the Unique Securitized Notes
and the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, including limitations on the ability of Unique Group to make
certain upstream payments to us. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are
insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

  - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the Indenture and the terms governing the Revolving Facilities, the Second Lien
Facilities, the Unique Securitized Notes, the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, the Sponsor Subordinated
Loan Agreement (if entered into) and any future debt, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.
Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be
no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of
such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements and any Operating Facility (as_**
**_defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in_**
**_any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees related to them will be secured, on a first- ranking basis
with security interests over the Collateral, which also secures our obligations under the Revolving Facilities
Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. Further, the Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement
and the Second Lien Facility Agreement permit the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms of these agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving
Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements and any Operating Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) that are secured by assets that also secure obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, will
receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

As a result, in the event of any realization or enforcement of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the
Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements or
any Operating Facility are greater than the proceeds realized.

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted for or will be_**
**_granted as security for the Notes and the Note Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy_**
**_the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will
be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to provide
funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following
an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than,
amounts due on the Notes.

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event
of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among other things, general market and economic

57


-----

conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair
market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going
concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the
Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not
be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion
of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a
measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value.

In addition, not all of our assets and those of the Issuer will be secured. In particular, no security will be provided
by any member of the Unique Group or with regard to any assets of the Unique Group. In addition, the security
granted by Midco over its shares in the Parent will be non-recourse to Midco other than in relation to the charged
shares. Furthermore, the Platinum Group is, or will be, designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and no security
will be provided by any member of the Platinum Group or with regard to any assets of the Platinum Group. See
“—Risk Related to Our Structure—Unrestricted subsidiaries, including the Platinum Group, will not be subject
_to the covenants in the Indenture governing the Notes.”_

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable
or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other
rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights
that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders
of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay
all amounts due on the Notes and the Note Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of
the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining
assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement
governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition,
there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all. Proceeds from enforcement
sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must first be applied in satisfaction of obligations
under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements and any Operating Facility (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and thereafter to repay on a _pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the_
Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted
to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition,
the Indenture allows incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral
on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce
amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

To the extent that other first priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture, the
Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Sponsor Subordinated Loan
Agreement (if entered into) and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, the parties may have or
may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control
over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. Subject
to the Security Documents, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture or a continuing
acceleration event under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or the Sponsor
Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into) would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among
other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect
to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary
course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that
have the benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether
on or after the date the Notes will be issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens

58


-----

and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability
of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security
interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the
Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third
parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may
not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of_**
**_the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but are granted
only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence the holders of the Notes will not have
direct security interests and not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the
Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

**_The Security Agent may not be able to appoint its choice of administrator in the event of insolvency nor have_**
**_the right to appoint an administrative receiver._**

There is a risk that the floating charges granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors do not constitute qualifying
floating charges (as defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (“IA86”)
and, as a result, it would be unlikely that the Security Agent would be able to appoint its choice of administrator
and the Security Agent would not have the right to appoint an administrative receiver. For further details on
appointment of administrators or administrative receivers, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and Security Interest—England and Wales— Administration and Floating Charges.”_

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, we would have the option to redeem the Notes._**

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as defined under “Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts,” become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments_
on the Notes or the Note Guarantees, we may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date
of redemption. We are unable to determine whether such a change to any tax laws will be enacted, but if such
change does occur, the Notes will be redeemable at our option.

**_The incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods, i.e. the periods of time_**
**_following the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in_**
**_accordance with the laws applicable in England, Wales and the Cayman Islands._**

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral
may restart or reopen such hardening periods, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security
granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future
indebtedness. The applicable hardening periods for these new security interests can run from the moment each
new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or perfected were
to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce such security interest. The same rights also apply in
connection with the accession of subsidiaries as additional Guarantors to the Notes and the granting of security
interests over their respective assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**Risks Related to Our Structure**

**_The Issuer is a wholly owned finance subsidiary that does not have any revenue generating operations of its_**
**_own and depends on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

59


-----

The Issuer is organized as a special purpose finance subsidiary to facilitate the offering of debt securities with no
business operations or material assets, other than its rights under various intercompany loans made to other Group
entities in relation to the proceeds of financings from time to time. The Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow
from our operating companies to meet its obligations under the Notes. If entities within the Group do not distribute
cash to the Issuer, in order for the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any
other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amount of cash
available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of our operating companies and the ability
of those companies to transfer funds under applicable law. Our operating companies, however, may not be able
to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly or indirectly, to
the Issuer in order for the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. Various agreements governing our
debt may restrict, and in some cases, may prevent the ability of the members of our group to transfer funds within
the group. In addition, the members of our group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make
payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, TDR Capital indirectly beneficially owns approximately 99.4% of
the outstanding shares of the Parent. As a result, TDR Capital is able to control matters requiring shareholder
approval, including the election and removal of our directors, our corporate and management policies, potential
mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The
interests of TDR Capital may differ from yours in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of TDR Capital, as ultimate majority
shareholder, may be in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment,
could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the
Notes. TDR Capital has no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to
fund our business if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture permits us to pay management
fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and TDR Capital may have an
interest in our doing so. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

Furthermore, TDR Capital and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may
from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly and indirectly with us, or with
which we conduct business. TDR Capital and their affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may
be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. You
should consider that the interests of these holders may differ from yours in material respects. See “Principal
_Shareholders” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”_

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” of the Issuer.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to
the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient
funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase
price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving
Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the agreements governing the Unique Securitized
Notes, the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement and the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into)
or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of
control may result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and a right to require
repayment of outstanding loans under the Second Lien Facility Agreement. The exercise of the right of holders of
the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt
documents, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from members
of our group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control,
may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay an equal amount of debt and cancel the
corresponding commitments under our Revolving Facilities Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal
under the Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an
event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer
for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the
purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent
to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In
addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a

60


-----

change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer
to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Sponsor
Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into). See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power
or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.
See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Except as described under “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase_
or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed
not to be a change of control if a defined consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed a certain level in connection
with such event. In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, whether or not such sale constitutes a change of
control under the Indenture, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our
current business and financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Parent’s and its
restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control
has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain Note Guarantees and Collateral may be released, and any retaken Collateral_**
**_may be subject to hardening periods._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown. See “Description of the Notes—IPO
_Pushdown.” Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), references to_
the Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time,
although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. Upon such substitution, each Holding Company (as defined in
“Description of the Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Note Guarantees or security granted by
such Holding Company in respect of the Indenture and the Notes will be released. In such a case, new security
documents in respect of collateral to be retaken and that will remain in place following an IPO Pushdown,
including the pledge of the shares of the Issuer, may need to be executed and be subject to new hardening periods.

**_English and Cayman Islands insolvency laws and other jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than_**
**_U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer and certain members of our group, including most of the Guarantors, are incorporated under the laws
of England and Wales. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely
to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law. In addition, the Parent and certain other Guarantors
are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any
of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of the Cayman Islands. English
or Cayman Islands insolvency laws are not identical to, and insolvency outcomes may vary from the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the
Issuer or Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
insolvency or similar proceedings or whether English/Cayman insolvency laws would be favorable to your
interests.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future guarantors, if any, or any other of the
Parent’s subsidiaries were to experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Any Note Guarantees and Collateral provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in
this Offering Memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise.
Any enforcement of the Note Guarantees or security after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other

61


-----

jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other
jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in
conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void
preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and
duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under
the Note Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”

Each Note Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or
subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.

Each Note Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Indenture provides that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor,
voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would
be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

Enforcement of any of the Note Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to
Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses
generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased
liability under its Note Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of any Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee, (ii)
direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or
to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically
if the court found that:

  - the relevant Note Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions,
when the granting of the Note Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the
recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee;

  - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for
the relevant Note Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the
relevant Note Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note
Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay at maturity;

  - the relevant Note Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent”
at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was
insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent
on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

62


-----

The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Note
Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise
being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee
may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to decide that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided
such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect
of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor
under the relevant Note Guarantee which has not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is
invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee
obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if
we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Note Guarantees will_**
**_be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released
automatically, including:

  - in connection with any sale or other disposition of the property or assets constituting Collateral, if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the “Limitation on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
covenant or other provisions of the Indenture;

  - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and share capital, of such Guarantor;

  - in accordance with the “Amendments and Waivers” provisions of the Indenture;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction
_and Discharge;” or_

  - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

  - in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) or the share capital of that Guarantor to a person that is
not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent or a restricted subsidiary of the
Parent, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Limitation on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary
Stock” covenant in the Indenture and the relevant Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of the sale or other disposition;

  - in accordance with the “Amendments and Waivers” provisions of the Indenture;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction
_and Discharge;” or_

  - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Note Guarantees will each be subject to release upon enforcement sale as contemplated under the
Intercreditor Agreement. Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall
not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the relevant Note Guarantees or security interests in
the Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

  - for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; and

63


-----

  - pursuant to a public auction, or a fairness opinion has been obtained from an independent financial
advisor. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the
_Notes.”_

**_Unrestricted subsidiaries, including the Platinum Group, will not be subject to the covenants in the Indenture_**
**_governing the Notes._**

The Platinum Group are Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Facilities
Agreement and the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement, and will be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries
under the Indenture and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. These entities will not guarantee the Notes. Other
than as described herein, Unrestricted Subsidiaries, such as the Platinum Group entities are not subject to the
covenants in the Indenture governing the Notes. This means that these entities (subject to restrictions under the
Platinum Facilities) may be able to engage in certain activities that we and our Restricted Subsidiaries may be
prohibited or limited from doing under the terms of the Notes. In addition, subject to any restrictions under the
Platinum Facilities, we could incur additional indebtedness in the Platinum Group, and secure such indebtedness
with the assets of the Platinum Group.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.
Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form will be
issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of the book-entry interests
will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes unless and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the
sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made
to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be
credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global
form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any other paying
agent or any registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant
through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the
Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the Notes and the
Note Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (as
registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent
you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient
to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

  - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar

64


-----

to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market
for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is
possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative
effect on you, as a holder of the Notes regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is
no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you
may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance
is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange being granted, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative
admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a
material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture allows us to issue additional notes in the future, which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks
related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value
of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by
the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and
trading of the Notes.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the
Notes comply with applicable securities laws.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and their
business is conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the
jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the
Indenture, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the
assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to
enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S.
Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the
federal securities laws of the United States. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent auditors._**

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports, including language limiting the
independent auditors’ scope of responsibility in relation to their audit work. Investors in and purchasers of the
Notes may have limited or no recourse against the independent auditors.

65


-----

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), the independent auditors’ reports included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum each states that the relevant report has been prepared for the Company and other
named parties (the “Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the Addressees for an audit opinion from
independent auditors on the directors’ reports and financial statements; that the report was designed to meet the
agreed requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time; that the report should not therefore
be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against the independent
auditors other than the Addressees for any purpose or in any context; that any party other than the Addressees
who obtains access to the report or a copy and chooses to rely on the report (or any part of it) will do so at its own
risk; and that to the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditors will accept no responsibility or
liability in respect of the report to any other party. In the context of the Offering, the independent auditors have
reconfirmed to us that they do not intend their duty of care in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such
as investors in and purchasers of the Notes, other than the Addressees of their reports.

Without in any way or on any basis affecting or adding to or extending the independent auditors’ duties and
responsibilities to the Addressees or giving rise to any duty or responsibility being accepted or assumed by or
imposed on the independent auditors to any party except the Addressees, the independent auditors have provided
consent to the Company’s inclusion, independently of the independent auditors, of the audit reports with the
historical financial statements to which they relate in this Offering Memorandum for the proposed issuance of the
Notes, thereby demonstrating that an audit of the directors’ reports and financial statements for each relevant
period has been undertaken for the Addressees. The consent provided by the independent auditors is different
from a consent filed with the SEC under Section 7 of the Securities Act, which is applicable only to transactions
involving securities registered under the Securities Act. As the Notes have not been and will not be registered
under the Securities Act, the independent auditors have not filed a consent under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
The independent auditors’ reports on the historical financial statements for the 52 weeks ended September 26,
2021, the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 are included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used
in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the
Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse
that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or
the directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which
independent auditors may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many
jurisdictions, including the UK. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of
holders of the Notes to bring any action against the independent auditors for damages arising out of an investment
in or purchase of the Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We intend to use the proceeds from the Offered Notes, the Second Lien Facility and shareholder contribution,
along with cash on balance sheet to:

- redeem any and all outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes;

- part-prepay borrowings under the Revolving Facilities Agreement;

- repay the borrowings under the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement in full; and

- pay certain costs, fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The estimated sources and uses of the funds are shown in the table below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated

equivalents reflects the portion of the cash we intend to utilize in connection with the Transactions, as further described under “Use of
_Proceeds.” The adjusted cash and cash equivalents does not give effect to any other movement in cash since April 7, 2024._

(2) Represents (i) £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 8.00% Fixed Rate Notes that were issued by the Issuer on July
13, 2020, (ii) £950 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 8.25% Fixed Rate Notes that were issued by the Issuer on July
31, 2020, (iii) £120 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 8.25% Fixed Rate Notes that were issued by the Issuer on
December 1, 2020 and (iv) £165 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 8.25% Fixed Rate Notes that were issued by the
Issuer on August 5, 2021, in each case, excluding any accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate carrying value of the Fixed Rate Notes
on our balance sheet as of April 7, 2024 was £1,742 million, which represents the sum of (i) aggregate principal amounts of the Fixed
Rate Notes and (ii) £34 million relating to the difference between the net present value of cash flow discounted at the original effective
interest rate and the principal borrowed, calculated in accordance with IFRS 9, net of £27 million of capitalized transaction cost. The
adjusted amount of Existing Fixed Rate Notes assumes that the entire aggregate outstanding amount of Existing Fixed Rate Notes are
redeemed. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(3) Represents the pound sterling equivalent amount of €495,788,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes,
consisting of €300,000,000 in aggregate principal amount issued by the Issuer on July 31, 2020 and €195,788,000 in aggregate principal
amount issued by the Issuer on August 5, 2021, excluding any accrued and unpaid interest, converted from euro at an exchange rate of
£0.91 per €1.00 (which represents the exchange rate used by us in our condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for
the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024). The carrying value of the Existing Floating Rate Notes on our balance sheet as of April 7, 2024 was
£436 million, which represents the pound sterling equivalent amount of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate
Notes (£452 million, converted from euro at an exchange rate of £0.91 per €1.00), deducted by £15 million relating to the difference
between the net present value of cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate, calculated in accordance with IFRS 9, and
£1 million of capitalized transaction costs. The adjusted amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes assumes that the entire outstanding
amount of Existing Floating Rate Notes will be redeemed.

the Offered Sterling Notes and £37 million of aggregate principal amount of the Premium Sterling Notes and (ii) £395 million in respect
of the Offered Euro Notes, which represents the pound sterling equivalent amount of €470 million of the aggregate principal amount of
the Offered Euro Notes, converted from euro at an exchange rate of €1.19 per £1.00 (which represents the spot exchange rate as of July
15, 2024 obtained by us from a third-party platform).

(5) Represents the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Facilities drawn by us as of April 7, 2024. The carrying value
of the Revolving Facilities on our balance sheet as of April 7, 2024 was £247 million, which represents the aggregate principal amount
drawn under the Revolving Facilities, net of £1 million in relation to capitalized transaction costs. In connection with the Transactions,
on or about the Issue Date, we intend to part-prepay £150 million of the outstanding amount drawn by us under the Revolving Facilities.
In addition, following the RCF Amendment Agreement, on or prior to the Issue Date, certain amendments to the Revolving Facilities

January 31, 2029. The Revolving Facilities under the Revolving Facilities Agreement provide for multicurrency credit facilities in an
aggregate amount of £273 million (of which £25 million is an overdraft facility). See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving
_Facilities Agreement.”_

(6) Represents the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Second Lien Facility in the amount of £400 million under the Existing
Second Lien Facility Agreement. In connection with the Transactions, we intend to discharge in full our outstanding liabilities under
the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement. Following such discharge, the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement will be
terminated. The carrying value of the Existing Second Lien Facility on our balance sheet as of April 7, 2024 was £392 million, which
represents the aggregate outstanding amount of the Existing Second Lien Facility, plus £8 million relating to the difference between the
net present value of cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate and the principal borrowed, net of £8 million of capitalized
transaction costs.

(7) On or prior to the Issue Date, we intend to enter into Second Lien Facility Agreement, which provides for the Second Lien Facility in
the aggregate principal amount of £156 million. The Second Lien Facility matures on the earlier of (i) the date falling three months after
the maturity date of the Notes and (ii) October 31, 2029. We intend to utilize the proceeds from the Second Lien Facility in connection
with the Transactions, including the discharge of our liabilities in full under the Existing Second Lien Facility. See “Use of Proceeds”
and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Second Lien Facility Agreement.”

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in the periods set forth below._

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements included_
_elsewhere in this_ _Offering Memorandum, as well as the “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial_
_Information.” The following presentation and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. For the reasons explained under “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” and elsewhere_
_in this_ _Offering Memorandum, our future results may differ materially from those expected or implied in these_
_forward-looking statements._

_Some of the measures used in this discussion and analysis are not measurements of financial performance under_
_IFRS and have important limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes_
_for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. See “Certain Definitions” and “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information.”_

_In this discussion, all references to the Group are to the Company and its Subsidiaries (which, includes the_
_Stonegate Group and Platinum Group); all references to Stonegate Group are to the Company and its Restricted_
_Subsidiaries (which excludes the Platinum Group); and all references to “we,” “us,” “our” are to the Group,_
_unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires._

**Overview**

We are the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites (4,414 Group sites and 3,380
Stonegate Group sites, as of April 7, 2024). We began our trading operations in November 2010 with the
acquisition of 333 pubs from Mitchells & Butlers and, through a series of strategic acquisitions, including the Ei
Acquisition, we are now the largest pub company in the United Kingdom. Since 2010, we have acquired
businesses and assets in order to geographically diversify our presence across the United Kingdom, providing
exposure to regional markets and a number of operating models, formats and brands that provide a diverse and
resilient financial profile. We continually evaluate opportunities to strategically acquire individual sites in
situations where those sites are a particularly good fit for our existing business.

We have a strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties, approximately 81%
by number of Group sites and approximately 90% by value (as of September 24, 2023) and a Group property asset
value of £4.1 billion (as of September 24, 2023). Within Stonegate Group, which has a property asset value of
£3.2 billion (as of September 24, 2023), our freehold estate comprises approximately 76% by number of sites and
approximately 88% by value, in each case as of September 24, 2023. We have a strong presence in London and
the southeast region of the United Kingdom and have diverse operating models, formats and brands.

Our revenue is generated from a variety of sources, including drink sales (76.7% and 77.2% of our Group’s
consolidated revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024) and food
sales (10.4% and 9.8% of our Group’s consolidated revenue in the same periods). We believe that our diverse,
resilient and agile business across operating models, formats and brands, led by our experienced and reputed
management team, is instrumental in driving our revenue growth. Our Group’s revenue, operating profit, and loss
after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 were £1,719 million, £68 million
and £155 million, respectively, and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 it was £916 million, £190 million and
£4 million. Stonegate Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 was £1,594 million and Stonegate
Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 would have been £411.6 million.

The pubs and bars sector in the UK experienced significant disruption due to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic and the subsequent government intervention, which resulted in the temporary closure of pubs and bars,
severely impacted trading in 2020 and 2021. However, according to CGA, the pubs and bars sector in the UK has,
in the year ended December 31, 2023, recovered to similar levels as measured by sales as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with pub companies experiencing particularly strong
trading in the past 12 months.

We operate three main business segments: Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run:

  - _Leased and Tenanted: Within our Leased and Tenanted segment, Pub Partnership is our principal_
business activity following the completion of the Ei Acquisition. In addition, this segment also includes

73


-----

commercial properties which consist of free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties that are operated and
managed by third-party leaseholders on arms-length agreements. A key feature of the Pub Partnership
operating model is the tie arrangement, whereby most Pub Partners have agreed under their lease or
tenancy agreements to purchase beer and other beverages through us. The tie arrangements, along with
rental income, provide us with resilient and recurring earnings. As of April 7, 2024, the Group has 3,019
Leased and Tenanted pubs, which includes 1,985 Leased and Tenanted pubs in the Stonegate Group with
the remaining 1,034 pubs in the Platinum Group.

  - _Managed Pubs: Our Managed pubs are owned and operated by us and derive their income predominantly_
from the retail sale of food and drinks, accommodation and gaming machines. We believe this segment
allows us to take advantage of the pubs we believe have a significant upside potential through direct
management by experienced pub managers and pub operators. Our Managed pubs are strategically
positioned to cater to different customer demographics, trends and occasions. Our Managed pubs are
classified into nine formats, Bars & Venues, Be At One, Popworld, Premium, Proper Pubs, Pub & Dining,
Slug & Lettuce, Social Pub & Kitchen and Sports Bar & Grill. In addition, within our Managed Pubs
business segment, we also have entered into 48 joint ventures with experienced retail partners. As of
April 7, 2024, we had 803 pubs operating within our Managed segment, all within the Stonegate Group.

  - _Operator-run Pubs: The Operator-run pubs are run by self-employed operators under our guidelines for_
managed pub operations, with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but typically a limited
food offering. The self-employed operator is paid a fixed percentage of revenue and is responsible for
employing all of the on-site staff. Accordingly, we benefit from low levels of operational gearing,
resulting in resilient earnings, downside protection and proportionally lower central costs to operate
Operator-run pubs. We operate these pubs under the Craft Union format, with one clear retail offer that
is drinks-led with quality beers at affordable prices, served in local, well-invested facilities, with audio
visual equipment for sports and entertainment. We believe that the structure of the Operator-run model
supports superior return on capital investment, as well as provides for higher levels of downside
protection given that we retain all revenue and meet all costs (other than staff costs, which are paid by a
self-employed operator who receives a percentage of revenue in order to do so). As of April 7, 2024, we
had 584 pubs operating within our Operator-run segment, all within the Stonegate Group.

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and directives from the UK government from time to time, our pubs
remained closed for business or operated under significant operating limitations for a majority of the duration of
fiscal year of 2021, which commenced on September 28, 2020. Our pubs remained closed for business from
November 5, 2020 to December 4, 2020 and from December 20, 2020 to April 11, 2021. In addition, some of our
pubs were also subject to localized closures as a result of tier restrictions or other local measures throughout the
period from September to November, 2020 and thereafter in December 2020. On April 12, 2021, we reopened a
majority of our pubs with outdoor seating areas for business, and in compliance with UK government’s directive,
we opened more of our pubs with indoor seating starting May 17, 2021. The remainder of our pubs were reopened
on July 19, 2021 in England and shortly thereafter in Scotland and Wales. As a result of this period of closure and
the measures we took to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial condition and results of
operation for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 differs when compared to the financial condition and results
of operation for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 or the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023. In addition,
our financial condition and results of operation for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, will also differ when
compared to the historical financial condition and results of operation for prior periods.

In response to the closure of our pubs and/or other restrictions, we have adopted swift measures to significantly
reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of
maximizing our liquidity position. Notwithstanding the steps we took to minimize cash burn and preserve liquidity
during successive lockdown periods, and our resilient operating and financial performance during periods of
limited reopening during 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the UK government’s measures in
response thereto have had a negative effect on our results of operations for the 52 weeks ended September 26,
2021. During lockdown periods, in particular, we did not record any revenue other than nominal rent revenue and
monies received in the form of government grants, which we recognized as other income.

-----

**_Financial Periods_**

Our historical consolidated financial statements have been drawn up for a whole number of weeks in accordance
with common practice in the pub industry. Financial years are therefore generally 52 weeks long, with the
occasional 53-week period to maintain our year-end to the Sunday nearest to the end of September each year,
which for 2021, 2022 and 2023 financial year periods were September 26, 2021, September 25, 2022 and
September 24, 2023, respectively. Our financial year accounting period for 2021, 2022 and 2023 was 52 weeks.
In addition, the comparability of our interim financial results is impacted by the varying lengths of our trading
quarters. Our first trading quarter of each 52-week financial year is made up of 16 weeks, while the remaining
three trading quarters of our 52-week financial year are each made up of 12 weeks. For that reason, our first trading
quarter may not be comparable to any of our other three trading quarters as they contain a different number of
weeks.

**_Change in Accounting Policy_**

On September 24, 2023, the Group adopted a policy of revaluation, which is a change from the cost model used
in prior years. Management have concluded the presentation of property, plant and equipment at valuation instead
of at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses results in the financial statements
reflecting the importance of the property portfolio to the operations of the business, as it provides current
information about the fair value of the Group’s property portfolio to users of the accounts.

The Group has applied this prospectively and accordingly has charged depreciation during the year 2023 and the
comparative information presented for financial year ended on September 25, 2022 has not been restated. On
adoption at September 24, 2023, upwards revaluations have been taken to the revaluation reserve whilst downward
revaluations have been taken to the income statement. The revaluation reserve is stated before tax, with the related
deferred tax recorded in retained earnings. Overall, there has been an upwards revaluation of £790 million which
has credited the revaluation reserve and a downwards revaluation of £48 million which has been debited to the
income statement. See Note 1.4 of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023.

**_Acquisition and Disposals_**

Our historical consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum
reflect the trading of certain pubs that we acquired, disposed of and closed during the 52-week periods ended
September 26, 2021, September 25, 2022 and September 24, 2023. Accordingly, because of the changes in the
number of pubs in operation in, and during, any given year, our operating results for each of the periods presented
are not directly comparable. For further information on the impact of our acquisitions and disposals on our results
of operations, see “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Strategic Initiatives” below.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**_Changing Consumer Preferences and Prevailing Macroeconomic Conditions_**

Our financial results are impacted by changes in consumer habits and preferences within the UK and our day-today trading is exposed to macroeconomic risks including deterioration in consumer spending prompted by any
downturn in the economy together with potential shifts in consumer spending patterns. The fundamental need for
consumers in the UK to socialize will always remain, however changes in consumer preferences are often rapid
and trends may continue to impact our financial results, particularly if we are unable to anticipate, identify and
respond to such changes by evolving our brands and offering adequately and in a timely fashion. Examples of
changes in consumer habits that have favorably impacted our financial performance include long-term growth in
the eating-out market, an increase in on-trade consumption of spirits and wines at the expense of beer, focus on
overall customer experience and an increase in popularity of pubs attracting women and families with children.
On the other hand, if consumers’ spending patterns in respect to alcohol evolve in such a way that they purchase
a higher proportion of their alcoholic drinks at supermarkets, off-licenses and other off-trade channels than has
been the case in the past, particularly in light of consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, where more
consumers than usual turned to these alternative sources to buy alcoholic drinks, we may experience a decline in
our sales. See “Industry.”

Adverse changes in the general macroeconomic environment can also have an impact on our sales. The outlook
for the UK economy is currently subject to significant uncertainty, which may lead the UK into a prolonged period
of economic downturn, recession or depression. Although the impact of COVID-19 has lessened more recently,

75


-----

inflationary pressures and the cost of living crisis in the UK has led to lower profit and operating cashflows than
would otherwise have resulted had these conditions not existed. In particular, the current cost of living crisis,
exacerbated by the war in Ukraine which has driven up energy and food prices in particular, has continued to
pressure consumers and the trading environment. More specifically, the pub industry in the UK is facing
significant inflationary cost pressures across drinks, food and wage lines, as well as due to the impact of increased
energy costs. While there has been an increase in the price of beer, other drink products and food that has resulted
in higher procurement costs, our operating costs have been particularly impacted by rising energy and
employments costs. Where appropriate, in recent periods, we have sought to selectively pass-on the increase in
our operating costs to our Pub Partners in our Leased and Tenanted pubs (by way of an increase in cost of drinks
supplied) or customers in our Managed and Operator-run pubs (by way of an increase in the price of our drinks
and food offerings). However, considering how consumer spending on eating and drinking out is discretionary in
nature, our continuing ability to pass-on increases in operating costs to our Pub Partners and customers is limited,
and as a result revenues and the trading environments of pubs are affected by general levels of disposable income.
While we seek to reduce the impact of additional costs by adopting pro-active measures such as selective price
rises, reconfiguration of product offerings in our pubs and implementing steps to further strengthen operational
productivity, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully reduce the impact of increased costs.
Our business is also subject to macroeconomic factors such as increased interest rates, reduced disposable income,
unemployment rates, taxes, consumer credit levels and house prices, which could all affect the level of consumer
confidence and, in turn, impact the level of consumer spending on eating and drinking out and other leisure
activities. In particular, an increase in interest rates could directly result in higher financing costs for us, including
through higher costs for funding working capital requirements, requiring further cash outflow for our business. A
rise in interest rates may also result in a downward pressure on the valuations of our assets.

**_Strategic Initiatives_**

From time to time, we dispose of and close down underperforming pubs to streamline our offering and focus on
our profitable operations. For the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, September 25, 2022 and September 24,
2023, and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, we disposed of 140 pubs, 69 pubs, 86 pubs and 36 pubs, respectively,
to third parties. As agreed with the UK Competition and Market Authority in connection with the Ei Acquisition,
we had undertaken to dispose of 42 sites to third parties (40 sites during the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021
and two sites for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022), which have been completed.

The following table presents the numbers of pubs acquired, disposed of and closed down, as well as the total
number of our sites, for the periods indicated:

(1) Since April 7, 2024, we have disposed of 16 sites, acquired no sites.

In addition, we proactively manage the composition of our estate and pursue a strategy of selective and
opportunistic acquisition whereby we seek to acquire high-quality pubs that complement our current offering.

On January 26, 2024, we completed a limited recourse financing of a portfolio of 1,034 Platinum Pubs, by
transferring the Platinum Pubs to the Platinum Group for an aggregate consideration of £810 million. The Platinum
Transactions followed a comprehensive and competitive process undertaken by us, and marked a significant
strategic initiative in achieving our long-term balance sheet goals and facilitating deleveraging, while preserving
optionality and value upside. See “Summary—Platinum Transactions.”

**_Operating Costs Control_**

Our cost structure mainly comprises drink and food costs, employment costs and other costs. Drink and food costs
and employment costs and are significant elements of our operating costs and accounted for 36.3% and 26.7%,

respectively, of our operating costs for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and for 35.5% and 25.9%,
respectively, of our operating costs for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024. Operating costs referred to in this section
are, for the avoidance of doubt, before depreciation and amortization.

The chart below illustrates the breakdown of our operating costs before depreciation and amortization for the 52
weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024:

_Drink and food costs_

Our results are affected by the cost of supplies purchased from third parties. While a majority of our supply chain
is UK based, we also seek to capitalize on opportunities to mitigate, where possible, foreign supply chain costs by
switching to less expensive geographies. We purchase beer and other drink products from various suppliers. Our
six leading drink suppliers during the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 were Heineken UK, Molson Coors (UK),
Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited, Diageo, Carlsberg and LWC Drinks. Our gross margins derived from beer
and other drink products is affected by changes in the wholesale prices at which they are bought from brewers
and suppliers and the corresponding changes in prices at which they are sold on to customers. Our gross margin
for drinks sales can also be impacted by duty escalators that may be applied by the government in the UK with
respect to alcoholic drinks. See “Industry.” Our gross margin for food sales is affected by the changes in prices at
which food is bought, the corresponding changes in wholesale prices at which they are sold on to customers and
the impact of our menu changes. As a result of inflation and current macro-economic conditions in the UK
(including the impact of Brexit) and elsewhere, there has been a general increase in wholesale prices of beer and
other drink products, as well as food. However, our drink and food costs remained stable, increasing only by a
non-meaningful percentage during the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 as compared to the 28 weeks ended April 9,
2023.

We rely on key suppliers and distributors to ensure there is a continuous supply of both food, drink and other
products to our Managed pubs and its publicans. We are exposed to the risk of failure by these suppliers to deliver
in the required time frames or to the standards expected. We have mitigated supply risks as much as possible by
expanding the number of our key suppliers for food and drink and have established a disaster recovery and
business continuity plan to mitigate such risks.

_Employment Costs_

Employment costs constituted 26.7% of our operating costs for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, of which
53.5% constituted the cost of wages (which are a variable cost to us) and the remaining 46.5% constituted the cost
of salaries (which are a fixed cost to us). In addition, employment costs constituted 25.9% of our operating costs
for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, of which 53.4% constituted the cost of wages and the remaining 47.8%
constituted the cost of salaries.

Minimum wage legislation, which is also driven by macro-economic conditions and inflation, largely establishes
our base compensation levels. In April 2016, the UK government announced the introduction of a National Living
Wage, which replaced the national minimum wage for all working people aged 23 and over in the UK. The
National Minimum Wage remained in place for all working people under the age of 22 who are at least school
leaving age in the UK. In April 2021, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the UK
to 18 was increased to £4.62 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20
and for people aged 21 to 22 was increased to £6.56 per hour and £8.36 per hour, respectively, while the National
Living Wage for people aged 23 and over was increased to £8.91 per hour. In April 2022, the National Minimum
Wage for people from school leaving age in the UK to 18 was increased to £4.81 per hour. At the same time, the
National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 22 was increased to £6.83 per hour
and £9.18 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 23 and over was increased to
£9.50 per hour. In April 2023, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the UK to 18
was increased to £5.28 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for
people aged 21 to 22 was increased to £7.49 per hour and £10.18 per hour, respectively, while the National Living
Wage for people aged 23 and over was increased to £10.42 per hour. In April 2024, in the UK, the National

77


-----

Minimum Wage was increased to £6.40 per hour for people aged under 18, to £8.60 per hour for people aged 18
to 20, and to £11.44 per hour for people aged 21 and over.

While we closely monitor staffing levels, especially in our Managed Pubs business to ensure efficiency of staff
rostering and to effectively manage our employment costs, a continued increase in such costs, whether due to
macro-economic environment, market conditions or increases in mandatory minimum wages or benefits, can have
a material impact on our results of operations. Increases in employee turnover can also result in increased
recruiting expenses and reduced efficiency through lost management time. During the 28 weeks ended April 7,
2024, our employment costs increased by 3.5% as compared to the prior period, primarily due to increases in the
National Living Wage and salary increases driven by macro-economic conditions and inflation and offer
potentially by a smaller estate. In this context, we have implemented an initiative to optimize organizational
functions across our operations and reduce headcount, which we estimate will result in an annual cost savings of
£8 million. A majority of the identified headcount reductions have been completed and we expect remaining
reductions to be completed during the course of financial year 2024. Our cost savings estimate include severance
and other related costs that we expect to incur.

Employment costs includes within it labor costs. For the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks
ended April 7, 2024, our labor costs, which represents our aggregate site labor costs only (and is a financial metric
commonly used in our industry) were 19.4% and 19.6%, respectively, of revenue. We believe that we have the
ability to manage our fixed and variable labor costs at different levels of sales volumes if it is required.

_Other costs_

With respect to our property portfolio as of April 7, 2024, the majority of our leases have less than five-year rent
review cycles. We believe that relatively weak commercial rental markets outside of London give us a strong
negotiating position in those markets. Our capital investment in the pubs we rent and efforts to extend lease terms
have also historically helped us negotiate rent concessions from our landlords. For the period our pubs were
temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent
payments during the period of closure.

We believe that we have the ability to manage our managed pub site costs at different levels of sales volumes if it
is required; however, we have less flexibility to manage our operating lease rental expense, site overhead costs
and central overhead costs at different levels of sales volumes. Costs related to our business rates are affected by
government policies in effect from time to time. Our site costs (including costs associated with trading, energy
and utilities, door, live entertainment, consumables, promotions, staff expenses, Sky TV, house repairs, refuse and
other site operating costs) were £216 million and £133 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and
the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively. Our site costs, increased by 7.8% during the 28 weeks ended April
7, 2024 as compared to the prior period, primarily due to the increase in energy and utility costs at our Managed
and Operator-run pubs. As a result of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, the global energy market has seen
significant disruption in recent periods and a substantial increase in business and domestic energy prices. In
response, among other initiatives, the UK government announced discounts on business energy unit rates
applicable from October 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Effective April 1, 2023, the UK government announced a
new scheme for businesses with a reduced level of discount to energy rates available if the wholesale energy prices
are above a certain price threshold. The UK government energy discount scheme lapsed on March 31, 2024.
Although we have benefited from these schemes, as a result of drop in energy prices during summer of 2023, we
are currently not utilizing this scheme. In addition, on the back of recent drop in energy prices, we have sought to
manage our exposure to energy costs by hedging almost 100% and 75% of our expected electricity usage for
summer and winter 2024 and 98% and 78% of our expected gas usage for summer and winter 2024.

Our site overhead costs (including bonuses, insurance premium, building repairs, other overhead costs and other
operating income) were £105 million and £38 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28
weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively. Our central overhead costs, covering head office and other pub support
costs, were £117 million and £76 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended
April 7, 2024, respectively. Our business rate payments were £46 million and £23 million for the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively.

In addition, we aim to control our operating costs through the efficient use of our utilities, such as lighting and
waste management, and we evaluate the terms of our contracts with our utility providers on an on-going basis.

**_Focused Investment Program and Continued Operating Efficiency Improvements_**

We have a focused investment program and take a disciplined approach to investment appraisal. We identify
priority investments through biannual estate reviews, and approve each project at multiple levels, before it can
finally be approved at our senior management meetings. Proposed schemes are reviewed at the Managing Director
executive committee chaired by our managing directors and the operations board chaired by our CEO before being
authorized at our senior management meetings chaired by our chairman. After the COVID-19 closure period,
beginning June 21, 2021 through April 7, 2024, we have refurbished approximately 120 Managed or Operatorrun pubs and converted 185 pubs from our Leased and Tenanted estate. Our investments made over the last two
years are also presented at each senior management meeting for post-investment review.

We seek to actively invest in our estate, with a particular focus on executing opportunities with relatively high
return on investment. We periodically carry out a detailed review and identify opportunities to convert pubs in
each of our Leased and Tenanted, Managed and Operator-run formats to the other formats, generally with a view
to potentially uplift EBITDA per pub and increase profitability. Further to the Ei Acquisition, we have
implemented a program to convert select Leased and Tenanted pubs to Craft Union pubs and to our other Managed
pub formats. In particular, we believe that a significant opportunity for value creation exists in the Craft Union
community pubs model (quasi-managed/franchised platform), as these pubs are run by self-employed operators
who receive a fixed percentage of revenue generated in these pubs, thereby making site earnings less volatile. In
addition, we have also selectively converted certain Managed pubs into Operator-run pubs, and particularly to
manage our operating costs while earning revenue as dry rent and/or wet rent, into Leased and Tenanted pubs.
During the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, we converted 15 Leased and Tenanted pubs to Managed pubs,
63 Leased and Tenanted pubs into Operator-run pubs, 23 Managed pubs to Operator-run pubs and 29 Managed
pubs to Leased and Tenanted Pubs. In addition, during this period, we also converted three Operator-run pubs to
Leased and Tenanted pubs. During the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, we converted 1 Leased and Tenanted pub
to a Managed pub, 16 Leased and Tenanted pubs into Operator-run pubs, 24 Managed pubs to Operator-run pubs,
17 Managed pubs to Leased and Tenanted pubs and 8 Operator-run pubs to Leased and Tenanted pubs. We believe
that our ability to successfully identify ideal trading formats for the pubs we acquire, and to integrate and/or
convert these pubs into those formats, has allowed us to achieve strong like for like revenue growth.

During the periods impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts at the time to manage cash outflows and
preserve and build liquidity, our ability to make investments in our estate, including investments made to convert
Leased and Tenanted pubs from Ei Group’s estate to our Managed Pubs formats or to the Craft Union format, was
limited. Following the removal of the COVID-19 restrictions and the return to a steady state of business, we
resumed actively investing in our estate. In particular, for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, the Group
spent £64 million on Investment Capital Expenditure, as compared to £55 million during the 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022 and £18 million during the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021.

Furthermore, in light of the increase in our operating costs in recent periods, we have begun implementing a
program to selectively convert certain Managed pubs into Leased and Tenanted pubs or Operator-run pubs. We
believe that the selected pubs are more suitable for operations under the Leased and Tenanted model, and the
conversion will allow us to better rationalize our operating cost, while earning revenue from these pubs as dry
rent and/or wet rent. We intend to continue to implement these conversions during the course of financial year
2024.

**_Ability to Assist Pub Partners and Utilize Learnings from our Managed Pubs Segment_**

We have historically provided Pub Partners with a broad range of services to help them increase sales and reduce
costs, and to operate their pubs efficiently and effectively. In particular, from the operation of our Managed Pubs,
we are able to provide additional insight, experience and best practices, all of which help us further enhance the
support that can be provided to Pub Partners. We also assist Pub Partners during periods of economic challenge
in order to help prevent business failures, including providing direct financial assistance. For instance, in light of
and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we had extended an overall support package to our Pub Partners consisting
of rent credits, trade credits, concessions on tie release fees and fixtures and fittings. The extent of business failures
and the need to provide support to publicans from time to time tends to affect income from our Leased and
Tenanted pubs. For example, if Pub Partners experience low sales volumes for extended periods of time, they may
not be able to pay rent at the levels agreed or at all, which could reduce our rental income.

**_Regulation_**

Our pubs are subject to laws and regulations that affect their operations, including in relation to employment,
minimum wages, alcoholic drinks control, late-night levies, drink-driving, pub licensing, leisure (gaming)
machines, competition, health and safety, sanitation, data protection and access for the disabled. See “Industry”
and “Business.”

We are subject to the Working Time Regulations in the UK. As we employ a large number of our staff at the
minimum wage, increases in the minimum wage may result in increases in our labor costs and, to the extent we
are not able to pass through these labor cost increases to our customers, we may experience an adverse impact on
our gross margins. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Operating Costs Control—
_Employee Costs.”_

In addition, in relation to a majority of our Leased and Tenanted pubs, we are subject to the Pubs Code, introduced
by the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, which came into effect on July 21, 2016. The Pubs
Code regulates the relationship between tied pub tenants and the large pub-owning businesses that rent pubs to
tenants and sell them tied products, and establishes a new independent Pubs Code adjudicator to enforce the code.
The Pubs Code provides tied publicans with a right, under certain circumstances, to replace their existing freelynegotiated tied agreements with a new free-of-tie MRO arrangement, which could have an impact on our income
from publican partnership pubs.

Licensing authorities in the UK are authorized to impose a late-night levy on late-opening alcohol suppliers. Many
of our pubs are open late and some are subject to these late-night levies. To the extent that individual licensing
authorities decide to implement late-night levies or the government decides to increase the scope of these powers,
we could experience an increase in our operating costs.

Furthermore, we are subject to certain disclosure requirements such as those provided under the Calorie Labelling
(Out of Home sector) (England) Regulations 2021 requiring businesses with more than 250 employees to display
calorie information on non-packaged food and soft drink menus. In addition, Martyn’s Law (currently expected
to be adopted as law in the coming months) puts premises owners under a duty to consider the threat from terrorism
and implement proportionate mitigating measures and its implementation could require us to undertake additional
expansion and/or reconfiguration in our premises. Compliance with these laws and regulations impose costs and
administrative burdens on us, as our managers are required to devote significant amounts of their time to managing
and ensuring compliance with these requirements, which reduces the time they are able to dedicate to the running
of the business. For risks related to changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new
regulations to which we may become subject, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in
_regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject could_
_have a negative effect on our business.”_

**_Seasonal Effects_**

Attendance levels at our pubs are affected by the weather and by the timing of major sporting events. Persistent
rain, snow or other inclement weather, especially during the summer months or over our peak trading periods such
as the Christmas period, Easter, bank holidays and end-of-the-month salary weekends, or weekends in general,
can have a negative effect on our revenue. Inclement weather during major sporting events can also affect our
revenue due to lower footfall resulting from poor weather conditions. The absence of major sporting events, or
the poor performance of a British team, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In particular,
the cancellation or postponement of sporting events (or the holding of sporting events behind closed doors or with
a limited number of spectators (for instance, during the period impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic), could lead
to lower footfall in our pubs, and thereby a decline in our revenue. The seasonality of the pub industry results in
variable demand and, consequently, our revenue and operating results tend to fluctuate from period to period.

**Segment Reporting**

Further to the acquisition of Ei Group (which we completed on March 3, 2020) and the integration of the Ei Group
business segments with our business, including the conversion of pubs into different operating models and formats
so as to enhance value creation and profitability, we introduced the following reportable segments from the period
commencing on July 4, 2021:

- _Leased and Tenanted, in which we have no direct involvement in the operations and which consists of_
(i) Pub Partnerships, covering rental income and revenue from supply of drinks and gaming machines

80


-----

from our tied Pub Partners and (ii) commercial properties, covering rental income from our untied
commercial properties;

- _Managed Pubs, in which we manage the site fully, taking on full operational risk and in return receiving_
the full retail margin, and which consists of (i) the managed pubs operated by us and (ii) managed
investments operated pursuant to certain joint ventures entered into by us with experienced retail
partners; and

- _Operator-run, in which we contract with a third party operator to manage the day-to-day operations of_
the site, receiving a turnover-based fee. All labor costs are borne by the third party, but all other costs are
borne by us, and we have access to the full retail margin covering revenue from the sale of food, drink,
accommodation and gaming machine income. This segment consists of our Craft Union format.

Note 2 of our financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 and the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum presents revenue, Group Pre-adjusted
EBITDA and certain other metrics by reporting segment. We eliminate intersegment revenues and costs upon
consolidation and the segmental note is presented net of these eliminations.

All of our revenue is generated in the UK and is not further segmented based on location. Therefore, no
geographical segmental analysis has been provided.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue is mainly derived from the sale of food and drinks to third parties, after deducting discounts and
VAT. It also includes revenue derived from admission, accommodation and machine (gaming), and is recognized
at the point of sale. In addition, it includes rent revenue, which is recognized on a straight line basis for the term
of the lease based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements.

**_Other Income_**

Other income includes monies received in the form of government grants and furlough income and are recorded
in the income statement in the same periods during which the related expenses were incurred.

**_Operating Costs before Depreciation & Amortization_**

Our operating costs before depreciation and amortization represent our drink and food costs, employment costs
and other costs. For instance,

- our drink and food costs represented 36.3% of our operating costs before depreciation and amortization
for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and 35.5% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, and in
each case, primarily comprised the costs associated with the supply of our food and drinks;

- our employment costs represented 26.7% of our operating costs before depreciation and amortization for
the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and 25.9% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, and in each
case primarily comprised salaries and wages to our staff and management; and

- our other costs represented 37.0% of our operating costs before depreciation and amortization for the 52
weeks ended September 24, 2023 and 38.6% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, and in each case
primarily comprised, energy and utilities costs, door costs (i.e., costs associated with entrance security at
some of our pubs), live entertainment costs, live sport subscription costs (such as the cost of subscriptions
to Sky TV), repair and maintenance costs, business rates, insurance costs, marketing costs and IT system
costs.

81


-----

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA represents operating profit / (loss) before depreciation, amortization, impairment, revaluation and profit
on sale of non-current assets.

**_Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment and Revaluation_**

Depreciation relates to the depreciation and impairment of our property, plant and equipment over their useful
lives. Amortization relates to the amortization and impairment of certain of our intangible assets over their useful
lives. Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions is capitalized and is tested annually for
impairment.

**_Profit/(Loss) on Sale of Non-Current Assets_**

Profit/(loss) on sale of non-current assets represents the difference between the proceeds received from the sale
of a site and its book value. For the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and the 52 weeks ended September 24,
2023, this line item also includes write-offs related to certain tangible fixed assets at certain sites that are no longer
in use due to capital investments made at these sites.

**_Finance Income_**

Our finance income represents interest receivable on loans extended to certain members of our management as
well as interest that accrued on our overnight bank deposits, which we recognize as it accrues using the effective
interest method.

**_Finance Costs_**

Our finance costs include interest on bank loans, notes, the loans made to certain members of our management,
certain pension charges related to the carrying value of our pension liability to its fair value, amortization of debt
issue costs and certain other interest expenses.

**_Movement in Fair Value of Swaps_**

Movement in fair value of swaps represents the movement on the fair value of the interest rate and currency swaps
between balance sheet dates.

**_UK Income Tax Credit/(Charge)_**

The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because
of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is
recognized, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, except as
otherwise required by International Accounting Standard 12.

An increase of corporation tax in the UK to 25% (effective from April 1, 2023) was announced by the UK
government in the March 2021 budget and substantively enacted in the prior year to adjust deferred tax balances
to the 25% tax rate.

**_Profit/(Loss) for the Period_**

Profit/(loss) for the period represents the result of the consolidated income statement after provision for taxation.

and Tenanted to Craft Union formats) and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the prior period. During
the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, as a result of the spread of “Omicron” COVID-19 variant in December
2021, our Christmas trading results were adversely impacted. In addition, for a period of time during the months
of December 2021 and January 2022, we were also subject to certain government-mandated restrictions, such as
requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccines or a negative lateral flow test for entry into nightclubs in England and
Wales, and social distancing requirements, restrictions on number of customers in hospitality venues and closure
of nightclubs in Scotland and Wales.

weeks ended September 24, 2023 increased by £35 million, or 3.6%, from £976 million for the 52 weeks ended

52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 increased by £36 million, or 22.2%, from £162 million for the 52 weeks

energy costs and increased costs in line with higher sales. In addition, our central costs, for the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 increased by £10 million, or 9.3%, from £107 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25,

by £29 million, or 8.2%, from £353 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 to £382 million, primarily
driven by an increase of £134 million in the level of goodwill impairment in the 52 weeks ended September 24,
2023. This was partly offset by the difference between the £145 million net movement from impairment in the 52
weeks ended September 25, 2022 under a cost model and £56 million net downwards revaluation charged on
property, plant and equipment under revaluation model in the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023.

33.3%, from £6 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 to £8 million for the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 due to higher proceeds received by us pursuant to site disposals.

**_Finance Income_**

Our finance income for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022
remained constant at £2 million.

million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 to £301 million, primarily due to increased interest expense
on our floating rate debt that is not subject to swap arrangements, most notably our Existing Second Lien Facility
and our Revolving Facilities.

Our movement in fair value of swaps for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 decreased from a positive £33
million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 to a negative £26 million for the 52 weeks ended September
24, 2023, driven by ordinary course market movements in the value of our swap arrangements.

Our tax credit on ordinary activities increased from a charge of £3 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25,
2022 to a charge of £102 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, primarily due to deferred tax being
recognized on the change of accounting policy for the revaluation of assets and partly due to the movement in
profits/losses before tax.

**_Profit/(Loss) for the Period_**

We reported a loss of £155 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 compared to a loss of £127 million

**_Revenue_**

Our revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 increased by £904 million from £707 million for the 52
weeks ended September 26, 2021 to £1,611 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, primarily due to
the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic measures during the prior period, which resulted in higher trading level and
increased sales across our segments. In particular, our pubs remained closed for business from November 5, 2020
to December 4, 2020 and from December 20, 2020 to April 11, 2021. In addition, some of our pubs were also
subject to localized closures as a result of tier restrictions or other local measures throughout the period from
September to November, 2020 and thereafter in December 2020. On April 12, 2021, we reopened a majority of
our pubs with outdoor seating areas for business, and in compliance with UK government’s directive, we opened
more of our pubs with indoor seating starting May 17, 2021. The remainder of our pubs were reopened on July
19, 2021 in England and shortly thereafter in Scotland and Wales. Set forth below is a split of our revenue as per

received during the 52 weeks ending September 26, 2021.

**_Operating Costs_**

Our operating costs for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 increased by £483 million, or 72.7%, from £664
million for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 to £1,147 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022,
primarily due the increased revenues 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 following the lifting of COVID-19

volumes across our business segments.

pandemic: our operating costs of our Leased and Tenanted pubs for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022

Our depreciation, amortization, impairment and revaluation for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 increased
by £257 million, from £96 million for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 to £353 million for the 52 weeks
ended September 25, 2022, primarily due to a £145 million net movement from impairment in the 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022, which is calculated as the carrying amount of such property, plant and equipment which may
not be recoverable, and reflects our assessment of the reduction in our freehold and leasehold property values, as
compared to the prior period, when we recognized a net £74 million impairment reversal credit. In addition,
goodwill was also impaired by £44 million during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, in line with the
property impairments.

50.0%, from £4 million for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 to £6 million for the 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022, primarily due to higher proceeds received by us pursuant to site disposals.

**_Finance Income_**

Our finance income for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 increased by £2 million, from £0 for the 52 weeks
ended September 26, 2021 to £2 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, due to £1 million interest
on a tax refund received by us and £1 million of other interest payments received by us.

million for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 to £283 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022.
This increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of additional Existing 8.00% Fixed Rates Notes during
the course of the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 (£120 million in aggregate principal amount issued on
December 1, 2020 and £165 million in aggregate principal amount issued on August 5, 2021), whereas interest
was paid on such additional Existing 8.00% Fixed Rates Notes throughout the course of the 52 weeks ended
September 26, 2021. Such additional interest expense was partially offset by the reduced interest expense payable
by us pursuant to the exchange of the then outstanding senior term loan facilities into additional Existing Floating
Rates Notes, which was completed on August 5, 2022.

**_Movement in fair value of swaps_**

Our movement in fair value of swaps for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 increased from a negative £28

September 25, 2022, primarily due to the increased amount of taxable loss during the 52 weeks ended September
26, 2021 as compared to the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022.

**_Profit/(Loss) for the Period_**

We reported a loss of £127 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 compared to a loss of £193 million
for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021.

**Key Operating Metrics of Stonegate Group**

Our like to like metrics, in particular, Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate
Group Operator-run Revenue Growth (Like for Like) and Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like),
are some of the key operating metrics used to evaluate our performance. Various factors affect our like for like
metrics, including:

- the prevailing economic climate and trends, including the impact of inflation and high interest rate;

89


-----

- customer preferences and our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends and customer
preferences;

- changes in the competitive environment;

- the level of our capital investment in our pubs;

- changes in our food and drink mix and pricing;

- the number and mix of pubs included in the calculation;

- health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;

- management of our pubs and the level of customer service that we provide; and

- our ability to source and distribute food and drink products efficiently.

We present these like-for-like metrics, as we believe they enable discussion on comparative operating performance
of our pubs in each of our three segments. In addition, we present them for Stonegate Group only as the Notes
shall be guaranteed by Stonegate Group entities and the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, the Revolving
Facilities Agreement apply to Stonegate Group only. We believe these Stonegate Group metrics enhance the
investor’s understanding of Stonegate Group and its ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital
expenditures and meet and service its obligations. These Stonegate Group metrics have not been and will not be
audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. Such figures may not have
been prepared on the same basis as the Group figures and therefore investors should not place undue reliance on
such figures.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and directives from the UK government from time to time, our pubs
remained closed for business or operated under significant operating limitations for a majority of the duration of
fiscal year of 2021, which commenced on September 28, 2020. As a result, we have presented below Stonegate
Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Operator-run Revenue Growth (Like for Like)
and Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like) for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the
28 weeks ended April 7, 2024.

The following table presents Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group
Operator-run Revenue Growth (Like for Like) and Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like), for
the periods indicated:

Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like) was 0% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024,
primarily due to price increases, with a positive Christmas trading period being offset by a challenging trade in
January and February 2024. Stonegate Group Managed Revenue Growth (Like for Like) was 3.0% for the 52
weeks ended September 24, 2023, primarily due to retail price increases across food and drink.

**_52 weeks ended September 24, 2023_**

Stonegate Group Operator-Run Revenue Growth (Like for Like) was 3.1% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024,
primarily due to price increases offsetting a challenging trade in January and February 2024. Stonegate Group
Operator-Run Revenue Growth (Like for Like) was 10.3% for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, primarily
due to retail price increases across food and drink.

**_ended September 24, 2023_**

Stonegate Group L&T Revenue Growth (Like for Like) was 6.2% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 and 5.5%
for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 primarily due to annual price increases more than offsetting volume
decline and inflation and inflation positively impacting rental income.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Liquidity_**

We have significant debt service obligations. As of April 7, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions (including
the issuance of the Notes, and the application of the proceeds therefrom, as applicable), Stonegate Group would
have had total adjusted third-party debt of £2,521 million (excluding a lease liability of £658 million as of April
7, 2024, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16). Following the completion of the Transactions, our Revolving
Facilities are expected to be drawn in an amount of £98 million, and we would have £150 million of credit facilities
and £25 million of overdraft facilities available to draw under the Revolving Facilities Agreement (subject to our
continued compliance with the covenants therein, including the financial covenant). See also “Capitalization” and
“Description of Other Indebtedness.”

The Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement contain, and the Indenture governing
the Notes and the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into) will contain, covenants significantly
restricting our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the
Parent;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances
to and on the transfer of assets to the Parent or its restricted subsidiaries;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities;

- consolidate or merge with other entities;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

- amend certain documents.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. These covenants could
limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs.

We depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our operating activities, supply capital
to finance our operations and growth, make capital expenditure and manage our debt levels. As a result, our
principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our operating cash flow. Our ability to generate cash depends
on our future operating performance, which in turn depends on general economic, financial, industry and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” In addition,
we have access to the Revolving Facilities to service our working capital and general corporate needs. The
availability of this facility is dependent upon conditions, including compliance with financial covenants relating
to our consolidated leverage ratio and other covenants as described further under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Revolving Facilities Agreement.” Although we believe that our expected cash flows from_

91


-----

operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service
needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future
debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due,
including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

- increase in our operating costs, including drink and food costs, employment costs (such as cost of wages
and labor costs) and other costs such as energy and utility costs, due to inflation and other macroeconomic conditions;

- a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could be
due to downturns in our performance or the industry or the UK economy as a whole;

- exposure to increased interest rates and, more generally, financing costs in relation to that portion of our
borrowings which bears interest at a variable rate;

- inability to access capital;

- adverse working capital developments;

- a reduction in operating cash flows due to prolonged periods of closure or restrictions in the operations
of our pubs due to COVID-19 or other health emergencies; and

- any need to fund higher than anticipated capital expenditures.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under our Revolving
Facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced
to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

- reduce or delay our planned acquisitions;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, after giving effect to the Transactions, limit our
ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt. We anticipate that our high leverage
will continue for the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for
you. For more information, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities_**

Our net cash flow from operating activities increased by £57 million, from a net cash inflow of £181 million for
the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023 to a net cash inflow of £238 million for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024. This
increase was primarily driven by improvements in trading across both our Leased and Tenanted and Operator-run
segments more than offsetting a decline in trade in our Managed Pubs segment, particularly post-Christmas.

Our net cash flow from operating activities increased by £20 million, from a net cash inflow of £402 million for
the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2022 to a net cash inflow of £422 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24,
2023. This increase was primarily driven by the pay down by us of certain overdue items, most notably rents, tax
and professional fees, which related to previous periods when our pubs had remained closed due to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic and had been deferred and thus negatively impacted cash flows in the 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022.

Our net cash flow from operating activities increased by £216 million, from a net cash inflow of £186 million for
the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 to a net cash inflow of £402 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25,
2022. This increase was primarily due to improved trading performance at our pubs and higher cash generation
during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, as compared to 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, which was
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities_**

Our net cash flow from investing activities decreased by £19 million, from a net cash outflow of £68 million for
the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023 to a net cash outflow of £49 million for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024. This
decrease was primarily due to an increase in the cash received from disposals during the 28 weeks ended April 7,
2024 together with a reduction in the cash spent on capital expenditure in the same period.

Our net cash flow from investing activities decreased by £3 million, from a net cash outflow of £98 million for
the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 to a net cash outflow of £95 million for the 52 weeks ended September
24, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to due to a loan of £4 million being made to a parent company.

Our net cash flow from investing activities increased from a net cash inflow of £13 million for the 52 weeks ended
September 26, 2021 to a net cash outflow of £98 million for the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022. This increase
was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of pubs disposed of by us (63 disposals during the 52 weeks
ended September 25, 2022 as compared to 140 disposals during the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021), which
resulted in lower inflows compared to the prior period, and higher Investment Capital Expenditure across our
estate (£55 million during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 as compared to £18 million during the 52
weeks ended September 26, 2021), in each case, during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 as compared to
the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021.

**_Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities_**

Our net cash flow from financing activities increased by £572 million, from a net cash outflow of £163 million
for the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023 to a net cash inflow of £409 million for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024.
This increase was primarily due to a net cash inflow of £609 million as a result of the Platinum Transactions partly
offset by higher interest payments on the Existing Second Lien Facility and Revolving Facilities.

Our net cash flow from financing activities decreased by £27 million, from a net cash outflow of £395 million for
the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 to a net cash outflow of £368 million for the 52 weeks ended September
24, 2023. This decrease was driven by a lesser amount of rent paid by us to landlords during the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 as compared to the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022. During the 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022, we paid additional rent amounts to our landlords in respect of certain prior periods when our
pubs were shut down pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic and the payment of such rent had been deferred. In
addition, the decrease in net cash outflow from financing activities during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022
as compared to the prior period, was partially offset by higher interest expense paid by us during this period.

Our net cash flow from financing activities increased by £126 million from a net cash outflow of £269 million for
the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 to a net cash outflow of £395 million for the 52 weeks ended September
25, 2022. This increase was primarily due to receipt of proceeds from the issuance of £165,000,000 in aggregate
principal amount of the 8.25% Existing Notes during the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, with no
corresponding receipt of proceeds from debt financing received by us during the 52 weeks ended September 25,

-----

2022, and additional rent amounts paid to our landlords during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, in respect
of certain prior periods when our pubs were shut down pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic and the payment of
such rent had been deferred.

During the periods under discussion, our capital expenditures have been made in relation to Investment Capital
Expenditure and Maintenance Capital Expenditure, primarily real estate refurbishments and upgrades, our pub
conversion program (including, conversion of Leased and Tenanted pubs to Craft Union and other Managed
formats, and conversion of Managed pubs to Craft Union format), general maintenance and enhancement of the
estate and investment in IT expenditure. Our Group’s capital expenditure decreased slightly to 8.4% of revenue
for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 compared to 8.7% of revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 25,
2022. Our Group’s capital expenditure decreased to 8.1% of revenue for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024
compared to 9.5% of revenue for the 28 weeks ended April 9, 2023. We constantly review the level of capital
being spent in line with our liquidity forecasts and the returns generated and expect to continue the current level
of capital expenditure during the course of financial year 2024.

For the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, 31.1% of capital expenditure constituted of Investment Capital Expenditure
and 68.9% of capital expenditure constituted of Maintenance Capital Expenditure. During this period, our Group’s
Investment Capital Expenditure (excluding conversionary capital expenditure) was made at 106 sites which
included investments in 64 pubs in our Leased and Tenanted segment, 33 pubs in our Managed Pubs segment and
9 sites in our Operator-run segment.

For the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, 44.4% of capital expenditure constituted of Investment Capital
Expenditure and 55.6% of capital expenditure constituted of Maintenance Capital Expenditure. During this period,
our Group’s Investment Capital Expenditure (excluding conversionary capital expenditure) was made at 181 sites
which included investments in 25 pubs in our Leased and Tenanted segment, 25 pubs in our Managed Pubs
segment and 17 sites in our Operator-run segment.

**Contractual Obligations**

The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of September 24, 2023, as adjusted to give
effect to the Transactions. The following table excludes any future interest payments that we would be required
to make. The table also excludes lease obligations and related interest and any payments under any hedging
agreements and related interest. For a summary of our actual contractual obligations as of September 24, 2023,

**Post-Retirement Benefits**

As of April 7, 2024, we operate two defined benefit pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable
salary. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.

Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured using market values and have been calculated using the full
annual actuarial valuation carried out as at February 28, 2023, updated on an approximate basis to September 24,
2023. Differences between the expected return on assets and actual return on assets have been recognized as an
actuarial gain or loss in our consolidated cash flow statement.

We also participate in two defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of certain employees. The assets
of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amount
charged to the income statement represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting
period.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of April 7, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

During the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, we entered into new cross currency interest rate swap hedging
arrangement to replace to replace our previous hedging arrangement in relation to our Existing Floating Rates
Notes, and from time to time, we may enter into new interest hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates or new currency hedging arrangements. See also Note 23 of our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Financial Risk Management**

Our board of directors regularly reviews our financial requirements and the risks associated with them. We have
summarized the principal risks arising from our current financial instruments below. See also Note 23 of our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We finance our operations through a combination of trading cash flows, bank borrowings and longer term notes.
Borrowings under our Revolving Facilities Agreement, Second Lien Facility Agreement and Euro Notes will bear,
floating rates of interest. We seek to minimize our cost of borrowings and reduce the impact of interest rate
fluctuations, including through the entry into interest rate hedging agreements. For additional information on these
activities, see “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”

**_Liquidity Risk_**

We seek to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet our foreseeable needs. We
monitor the maturity of our financial liabilities to avoid the risk of shortage of funds and also place surplus funds
on deposit so that they are available at short notice. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

**_Currency Risk_**

All of our revenue and the majority of our costs are generated in pound sterling and involve little or no currency
risk. We review our currency exposure on a continual basis and enter into hedges if we consider it necessary.

95


-----

**_Credit Risk_**

Our principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables. The credit
risk associated with cash and cash equivalents is limited. Credit risk is managed by transacting with financial
institutions with high-quality credit ratings. Trade receivables comprise a large number of individually small
amounts from unrelated customers and are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts. Management estimates
the provision for doubtful debts based on a review of all individual receivable accounts, experience and known
factors at the end of the relevant period. The credit risk associated with these is minimal. We have no significant
concentration of credit risk.

**Selected Significant Judgments and Estimates**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during an applicable period.

Management periodically evaluates its estimates and judgments and bases them on historical experience and other
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial
statements are discussed below. For a more comprehensive explanation of the accounting policies used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements as of
and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Exceptional Items_**

During the applicable periods, certain items are identified and separately disclosed as exceptional. Judgement is
applied as to whether the item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed. This assessment
covers the nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that item on reported performance.

**_Going Concern_**

The directors exercise judgement when concluding on going concern as the basis of preparation of the financial
statements. See also “Risk Factors—We may be unable to continue as a going concern.”

**_Presentation of deferred tax_**

The tax base has changed in the 52-week period ended September 24, 2023 as a result of property, plant and
equipment now being revalued and measured at fair value. This has resulted in a movement in the deferred tax
liability and a portion of this movement does not directly relate to the revaluation. IAS 12 does not provide any
guidance on how to allocate this overall movement between the income statement and other comprehensive
income and management have used judgement to allocate this on a reasonable basis to reflect both the unwinding
of existing deferred tax liabilities due to the change in tax base through the income statement and revaluation
through the statement of comprehensive income.

**_Valuation of property, plant and equipment, and investment property_**

Properties are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the revaluation reserve
except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognized as an expense
in the income statement in which case the reversal of the revaluation decrease is recognized in the income
statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken to the revaluation reserve to the extent that
there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is recognized in the income
statement as an expense. Changes to the fair value of investment properties are recognized in the income statement
in the period in which they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external valuers.

Licensed land and buildings are revalued annually to fair value in accordance with RICS Valuation–Global
Standards and IFRS 13. The valuation methodology uses an estimation of the fair maintainable trade (FMT) of a
pub held in PPE and commercial rent for a property held as an investment property and then applies a multiple.
The FMT is estimated based on historic trends and projected future income whilst multiples are determined by

96


-----

our valuers with reference to each specific asset and market information. For more details on the FMT and multiple
see Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023. The
valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. An adjustment to any
of these assumptions could lead to a material change in the property valuation. The highest and best use for the
licensed land and buildings is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally due to the legal restrictions
imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial implications of a change of
use given those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However, consideration is given to an alternative
highest and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists which is physically possible,
legally permissible and financially feasible.

**_Impairment of goodwill_**

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the
Group’s operating segments. As properties move between segments the associated goodwill will also be
transferred.

**INDUSTRY**

**UK Pubs and Bars Overview**

We predominantly operate in the pubs and bars sector in the United Kingdom, which continues to be a significant
part of the wider UK drinking-out and eating-out market. In the United Kingdom, this sector consisted of
approximately 43,150 pubs and bars as of the end of 2023, according to CGA.

The pubs and bars sector in the UK experienced significant disruption due to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic and the subsequent government intervention, which resulted in the temporary closure of pubs and bars,
severely impacted trading in 2020 and 2021. According to CGA, the pubs and bars sector in the UK has, in the
year ended December 31, 2023, recovered to similar levels as measured by sales as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with pub companies experiencing particularly strong
trading in the past 12 months.

**_Overview of Ownership in the United Kingdom_**

Public houses have been part of British culture for more than two millennia. More recently, about three decades
ago, the pub industry was dominated by six large brewers (Scottish & Newcastle, Allied, Bass, Courage, Grand
Met and Whitbread) who controlled just over half of all UK pubs and accounted for approximately 75% of UK
beer production.

In 1989, a report drafted by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that a complex monopoly existed in
favor of brewers who owned tied houses or who had tying agreements with free houses in return for loans (brewer
loans) at favorable interest rates. Subsequently, The Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989 (“the Beer Order”)
was passed to force the sale of 50% of breweries’ pub estates in excess of 2,000 units by November 1992. This
led to the development of the independent pub company, which took over ownership of many of these pubs from
the breweries. These pub companies typically negotiate agreements with the breweries for the supply of beer and
then on-sell that beer to the pubs they own, thus intervening in the direct sale of beer from breweries to pubs.

Since then, pub companies have increased their ownership of pubs in Britain. In 2006, pub companies owned
approximately 54% of UK pubs, with the two largest, Punch Taverns and the legacy Ei Group, controlling
approximately 30% of the UK pub sector. The Beer Order was revoked in 2002 pursuant to the Supply of Beer
(Tied Estate) (Revocation) Order 2002, following a review by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which found that
the sector had undergone significant changes in ownership, such that concerns relating to brewers’ vertical
integration and the Beer Order were not relevant anymore.

The ownership of pubs in the United Kingdom is broadly spread across three main categories of owners:

- Brewer-owned pubs, typically operating under a ‘tied contract’;

- Independent pub companies that either manage pub operations by themselves or lease the pubs out to
tenants; and

- Independent pub owners, who are typically individuals with either a single pub/bar or a small portfolio
of sites.

**_Operational Formats_**

The UK pub sector can be categorized into a number of distinct business models, across pubs and bars. The pubs’
business models include, among others, Managed, Leased and Tenanted (of which some are commercial or freeof-tie properties) and independently owned. For bars, a variety of late night offerings exist, differentiated by the
tempo of the environment, variety of product offerings and target consumer base.

_Managed Pubs and Bars_

Managed pub companies directly employ central management and local staff and have complete control over the
sales format and product offering within each pub. As a result, they benefit from the entire revenue, are responsible
for all costs, and ultimately retain all of the net income generated from their operations. Managed pub operators
have performed particularly well within the pub industry over the past few years and have improved their market
share as compared to Leased and Tenanted pub operators and independent pubs. Managed pubs also typically
generate higher gross margins than publicans or independent pubs, as Leased and Tenanted pubs are generally

required to purchase their beer at a premium from the pub companies that lease the pubs to them, while
independent pubs lack the scale to buy on terms as good as those from which large pub companies benefit. Apart
from the Stonegate Group, key operators within the Managed sector include Mitchells & Butlers and JDW, as
well as some of the estates of Marston’s, Greene King, Young’s and Fuller’s.

_Operator-run Pubs_

Operator-run pubs are owned by the pub company and are run by self-employed operators who receive a
percentage of revenue generated and are responsible for organizing and paying the staff. The remaining revenue,
other costs and management responsibility belong to the pub company. One of the key advantages of operatorrun pubs is the lower operational leverage as staff cost is directly linked to revenues. Additionally, these sites
benefit from having the Managed pub knowledge base with respect the areas of pricing, marketing, range and
scale while simultaneously benefitting from local operators who are embedded in the communities they serve.

_Leased and Tenanted Pubs_

Leased and Tenanted pubs are typically owned by a pub company or brewer but are operated by a third party
tenant or lessee, who normally pays below-market rent to the owner and is normally contractually obligated to
purchase the majority of its supply of drink products (in particular, beer) from the owner, an arrangement known
as the “tie.” Tied publicans typically enjoy support and certain benefits from pub companies as part of the
arrangement, such as marketing advice, capital investments or training courses. Importantly, the publican also
benefits from receiving living accommodation above the pub, allowing that person to cover quiet trading hours
without having to employ anyone. While the publican rents the building and fixtures and purchases the drinks
from the pub companies, the pub companies have limited direct influence on revenue generation (though there
can be ways to incentivize volumes sold through beer discounts) and limited exposure to the costs of the pubs, as
the pubs effectively operate independently and are responsible for their own operating costs (i.e., labor, food/drink,
energy and overheads). Following the acquisition of Ei Group, we are the largest Leased and Tenanted pub
company in the United Kingdom. Our main competitors in the Leased and Tenanted pubs segment are Star Pubs
& Bars, Punch Taverns, Greene King and Marston’s.

In July 2016, the Pubs Code introduced the MRO option allowing tenants to give notice to the landlord to opt to
pay rent at a free-of-tie commercial rate without requiring them to purchase drinks from the pub company. These
leases tend to be comparable to regular commercial real estate leases with upward rent reviews only. The typical
lease duration for commercial properties is 10 years or less.

_Independently Owned Pubs_

Independently owned pubs (sometimes known as “freehouses”) are generally smaller, standalone pubs owned by
private individuals who have free rein over the products offered. Their average revenue is generally similar to
tenanted pubs.

_Typical Elements of Basic Pub Agreements_

The table below sets forth the distinguishing characteristics typical of the most common types of pub agreements
in the United Kingdom:

**Market Overview and Competitive Landscape**

**_Historical and Current Market_**


Lessee Pub owner


According to CGA, the total UK food and drinks market in outlets that have a license to sell alcohol on the
premises (the “on-trade” market) is estimated to have reached £55.9 billion in sales in 2023, of which pubs and
bars retail sales comprises £30.7 billion. Between 2015 and 2019, the pubs and bars market showed 3.0% growth
per year on average. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the market value declined to £12.8 billion, before
recovering to above pre-pandemic levels after 2022. Throughout the same period, a reduction in the total number
of operating pubs and bars was observed, leaving the remaining pubs and bars to benefit from a more balanced
market position, capturing customers from those venues that closed down. Average selling prices have increased
as a result of factors such as the premiumization of drink offerings and underlying inflation, for example, the
average pub price of draught lager per pint has increased from £3.45 in 2015 to £4.57 in 2023. Further growth in
pub revenues is expected from increased food sales and higher traffic as a result of entertainment offered in pubs,
such as sporting events or live music. In 2023, the on-trade market in the UK is predominantly covered by
Managed and Leased and Tenanted establishments, with approximately 51% and 26% market share by value,
respectively.

**_Supply of Pubs and Bars_**

The UK pubs and bars sector has historically been overcrowded with a number of unprofitable sites. However, as
unprofitable sites exit the market and the remaining profitable estates win customer and revenue shares from those
that have exited, the result is a more balanced market. According to CGA, supply of bars and pubs in the United
Kingdom has decreased from 51,630 sites in 2015 to 43,154 sites in 2023. Within this trend, Leased and Tenanted
pubs in non-prime locations closed down at a faster rate than pubs in the broader sector, resulting in pub operators
selling off the less profitable parts of their estates. We expect that pub operators will continue to close or sell
unprofitable sites in the future (albeit at a slower rate), providing stronger, more resilient pubs the opportunity to
increase market share. According to the CGA, the number of Leased and Tenanted pubs saw a decline of 31%
from 23,290 to 15,989 over the six year period from 2015 to 2023, with Managed pubs growing 13% over the
same period. We believe that this demonstrates that pub companies are recognizing the benefits of directly
investing in and operating their estates, including each estate’s approach to branding, through a Managed operating
model, as opposed to relying on their tenants to do so under the Leased and Tenanted operating model.

**_Volume and Market Value_**

From 2010 to 2019, although UK pub sector revenues increased over time, total alcohol volumes fell as a result
of a combination of factors. These factors included lower prices at off-license stores and supermarkets, the
smoking ban, the economic recession and a general cultural shift toward opting for premium or craft products
over alcohol quantity. Ultimately, these factors also led to lower alcohol consumption. Despite the lower level of
alcohol consumption, the on-trade drinks market remains stable and resilient, with CGA estimating continued
revenue growth in the coming years.

**_Pricing_**

The on-trade price of beer has historically increased broadly in line with the consumer price index (CPI), although
recent inflation highs in 2022 and 2023 have resulted in CPI increasing ahead of the price of on-trade drinks. The
price of on-trade beer, off-trade beer and wine & spirits increased by 19.7%, 16.9% and 15.9% from January 2017
to January 2023 respectively. Over the longer period of 2005-2023, on-trade beer prices have increased by a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2% annually, whereas off-trade beer prices have increased by a
significantly lower rate by a CAGR of 1.3% annually, in the same period. We believe that the high growth
achieved in on-trade prices and the focus on promoting an increased range of offerings, including higher priced
cocktails and premium products, are the primary factors that have resulted in growth of total pub revenues despite
a fall in volumes.

**_Premiumization and On-trade Drinks Market_**

The on-trade market can be distinguished into four segments: the value segment, which covers venues that draw
price conscious customers; the mainstream segment, which covers branded and high street venues offering food
and drink at mid-range prices drawing middle- and high- income customers; the premium mainstream segment,
which covers experience-driven venues that provide a higher proportion of premium products and the premium
segment, which covers casual dining outlets and venues delivering high-end drink and food offerings.

Customer demand for premium drinks such as craft beer, craft cider, micro-distillery spirits, premium mixers and
cocktails has been growing. Within the on-trade market, the rapid growth in the popularity of cocktails has been
particularly important in increasing the profitability of pubs and bars, driving increased volumes for spirits and
allowing pub and bar operators to reposition themselves with higher per unit priced drinks.

According to CGA, the largest segments of the on-trade market (premium, premium mainstream and mainstream)

**_Competitive Environment_**

The pubs and bars sector in the United Kingdom faces competition from leisure and service providers such as
retail outlets for the sale of food and drink and restaurants (in particular casual dining outlets), as well as offlicense shops and supermarkets. Pubs and bars have therefore been increasing the breadth of their offerings in
terms of product range, experience-led occasions and access to broader demographics through late night offerings.
The wider on-trade food and drinks market can be broadly segregated on the basis of consumer age and
demographics. As seen in the market positioning map below, the operational flexibility of our various brands
enables us to target consumers across both age and demographics without hurting our own revenues, which we
believe gives us a competitive edge.

While the pubs and bars sector in the United Kingdom remains fragmented, it has undergone periods of
consolidation through joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions. This has led to the emergence of certain large
competitors with considerable financial and operational resources. We are the largest pub company in the United
Kingdom by number of sites as evidenced below, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage.

Leased & Tenanted Operator-run Managed


_Source: Publicly available company information for FY 2023/2024. Stonegate Pub Company’s 4,406 sites excludes 8 closed/non-trading sites._

We benefit from scale, diversified operating models, operational expertise, favorable geographic locations, high
quality estate and breadth of formats.

In the UK pub market, there is a dominance of large players, evidenced by approximately 62% of pubs being
operated under either Leased and Tenanted or Managed models (versus approximately 38% by independent
operators). Within the Leased and Tenanted or Managed category, 62% of pubs are operated by major pub
companies with 500 or more sites. The scale benefits the pub companies with large platforms through competitive
advantages including enhanced procurement, deeper operational expertise and greater operating leverage.
Therefore, as the UK’s largest pub company, we benefit from scale, diversified operational models, operational
expertise, favorable geographic locations, high quality estate and breadth of formats.

Major pub owners in the UK can be categorized into a few archetypes. The following archetypes are associated
with the corresponding strategies:

   - Pub rental revenue generators: Focus on owning a large portfolio of pubs and generating revenue through
leasing or renting pubs to tenants.

   - Scale-driven maximizers: Maintain direct control over pub operations, ensuring consistent experience
and maximised profitability through economies of scale. The breadth of the portfolio allows for efficient
allocation of resources, with investment directed towards the highest-returning opportunities.

   - Brewery affiliated networks: Promote and sell their own beer brands through a network of owned pubs,
driving brand recognition and dedicated sales for their products.

   - Integrated leisure operators: Operators who integrate their pubs into their leisure portfolio in order to
enhance guest experiences, attract customers and provide convenient entertainment offerings.

   - Independent pub operators: Entrepreneurial owners establishing unique experiences, often focusing on
local clientele and fostering a strong sense of community within their establishment.

**Overview of Trends Within the Wider Drinking-Out Market**

Pubs continue to hold cultural and social significance for UK consumers, and consumer spend has been resilient
despite macroeconomic-driven fluctuations impacting disposal income. The UK pub customer base has proved to
be resilient in the face of the cost of living crisis, reinforcing the view that eating and drinking out of the household
remains an important part of the average consumer’s lifestyle. We do not expect this to be significantly impacted
despite spending pressures on households. According to Barclaycard data, annual spend growth in pubs and bars
has outpaced restaurants during 2023 and year-to-date May 2024. In restaurants, customers have reduced the
number of visits, but spend greater amounts when they go out. In pubs, customers have retained the habit of
visiting a pub, backing up the view that visiting the pub forms part of a typical pub customers everyday life, but
their spend per transaction has been growing at a lower rate. As a result, overall Year-on-Year (YoY) change in
spending has been strong for bars, pubs & clubs, while restaurants have struggled in the post-pandemic
environment, as shown by the graph below. In particular, the rebound in pub spend at a faster rate than other ontrade categories following the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the prioritization of consumer spend at pubs
versus other leisure categories.

The resilience of the pub and bars industry in the UK is evidenced by the recent consumer surveys which highlight
that consumers continue to plan on prioritizing pubs over other discretionary leisure activities, such as holidays,
events and gym memberships.

In the period following the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers faced a cost of living crisis which strained household
finances as CPI including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) inflation increased to a peak of 9.6% in the
twelve months ended October 2022. Additionally, the Bank of England has increased rates on 14 successive

106


-----

occasions, resulting in the current base rate of 5.25%. As a consequence, the interest rate has passed through to
households on either floating rate mortgages or expired fixed rate mortgages, as well as fueling high increases in
average rental prices as a significant proportion of landlords are also impacted by the higher interest rate
environment through buy-to-let mortgages. However, CPIH inflation has abated in recent months, decreasing to
2.8% in the last twelve months ended May 2024, UK five-year swap rates have fallen and wage inflation has
remained strong. We believe that as a consequence of these three factors improving in recent months, consumer
confidence in the UK has increased and they are more likely to have the confidence to spend disposable income
on discretionary expenditure, of which eating and drinking out of the household is a key component.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has also been an increase in employees working from home
and adapting to hybrid working patterns, which has resulted in higher growth for pubs operating in suburban areas.

Younger generations are driving a decline in alcohol sales volumes due to their reduced alcohol consumption.
Nonetheless, they are boosting the market value by exhibiting a preference towards higher-end specialty beverages
and spirits. According to the BBPA, wine and spirits consumption has grown at a CAGR of 1.2% and 2.1%,
respectively, from 2000 to 2022, whilst beer consumption has declined by a CAGR of 1.2%, in the same period.

**_Experiential and Leisure Propositions_**

Consumer trends are now showing a growing interest in differentiated and memorable experience-led offerings.
With clear demand for a wider offering and service, leading operators have been upping their entertainment and
events to satisfy this shifting consumer preference, including televising major sporting events, hosting music
festivals, live music nights, escape rooms, garden games and raffles, all of which serve to retain existing
customers, attract the younger adult market (particularly among the 18 to 34 segment) and persuade infrequent
pub- and bar-goers to visit more often. Providing better and more complete experiences and leisure-based
entertainment in pubs and bars can lead to an increase in footfall and volumes.

**_All-Day Trading Formats_**

With the changing profile of the average consumer and a movement to all-day trading, there has been an
accompanying shift in demand for particular types of products and site formats. Pubs have proven to be
increasingly popular venues for out-of-home dining as customers continue to look for value by choosing pubs
over more expensive restaurants when eating out. The food offering increases the footfall in pubs and is an
additional growth driver for the overall pub industry.

**_Digitalization_**

Engagement with technology is impacting the way in which pub and restaurant owners interact with their
customers, specifically the millennial consumer demographic. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the
digitalization trend in the pubs and bars sector. Given the restrictions put in place by the UK government,
hospitality venues relied heavily on the use of technology in order to enforce social distancing measures.

107


-----

Moreover, the mobile channel is becoming increasingly important, in particular for booking and reservations,
enhancing the overall customer experience, engaging with customers outside the guest visit, speeding up payment
and real time customer feedback.

**_Increasing Input Costs_**


Input costs for pub operators have increased across key categories including energy, food and labor, with the latter
partially driven by staffing and recruitment challenges.

In terms of labor, the National Living Wage (NLW) for employees over the age of twenty-one (the highest level
of NLW) increased by 9.8% from £10.42 to £11.44 from April 1, 2023 to April 1, 2024. The OBR forecasts that
NLW will increase at 2.8% per year between 2024 and 2027. Not only does this impact employees earning the
NLW, but also it may have a knock-on effect on higher wage earners within the business.

In terms of energy, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused oil and gas prices to jump due to concerns
about disruption to supply. Sanctions on Russia, the embargo on Russian oil, a potential embargo on Russian gas
and cuts in Russian gas supply to Europe have pushed oil and gas prices up further still. There was a spike in
wholesale gas prices in early December 2022, but prices fell back in early 2023 and have since remained at levels
well below their 2022 peak, but still above their pre ‘energy crisis’ levels.

In terms of macroeconomic factors, the UK pubs and bars industry is influenced by the levels of consumer
confidence and performance of the economy, as discretionary spend on eating and drinking and pubs and bars is

-----

likely to increase when inflation is low, interest rate outlook is strong and annual wage inflation is high. As shown
in the chart below, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) forecasts CPI inflation to ease in the second half of
2024 alongside an aggregate increase in real wages for the UK population driven by persistently high annual wage
growth. As a consequence, consumer confidence is forecasted to increase, which will serve as an advantage to the
pubs and bars industry.

Additionally, inflation is an important factor to the UK pubs and bars industry because it relates to a significant
proportion of a venues’ cost base, including energy, food ingredients and drinks. As shown below, the ONS
forecasts CPI inflation to continue trending towards the Bank of England’s 2% target into 2025. As inflation falls
towards the Bank of England’s target, the pub companies in the UK are likely to benefit from interest rate cuts.

**_Regulatory Environment_**

The pubs and bars industry in the United Kingdom is subject to laws and regulations across a variety of operational
areas and related activities. These include premise licensing, pub licensing, the rental relationship between tied
tenants and large pub companies, alcoholic drinks control, late-night levies, leisure (gaming) machines,
employment, minimum wages, competition, health and safety, sanitation, drink driving, data protection and access
for the disabled.

In the UK, there is a growing acknowledgement from politicians that the property rates system is archaic as the
UK has moved to an online-focused retail environment. Accordingly, in 2019, the government introduced business
rates relief under the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure (“RHL”) scheme for certain retail properties. This scheme
was recently extended to its fifth year up until April 2025 and provides eligible RHL properties with a 75%
business rates relief up to a certain subsidy control cap.

**_Alcohol Duty_**

Alcohol duty is a tax charged at the point of production or importation of drinks of alcoholic strength exceeding
1.2% alcohol by volume. The alcohol duty system was simplified on August 1, 2023, with the new system
introducing measures to tax alcohol according to strength. Duty rates differ between beers, ciders, wines, spirits
and other fermented products, with higher rates of alcohol duty being levied on products with higher alcohol level.
This policy is an advantage for the pub industry as high proportion of sales is generated through beers and ciders,
drinks at the lower end of the spectrum of alcohol strength.

Since the implementation of the new duty system, the duty rates have been frozen at their levels at Autumn
Statement 2023 and Budget 2024. The rates are due to stay at this level until February 2025. Afterwards, the
government will revert to increasing duty rates in line with Retail Price Index from August 1, 2024. Meanwhile,
the UK government has also increased the value of draught relief, reducing the tax burden on alcoholic beverages
sold in on-trade venues, such as pubs, from 5.0% to 9.2% for beer, cider, flavored alcohol products and from
20.0% to 23.0% for wine and spirits products.

Stonegate Group sites, as of April 7, 2024). We began our trading operations in November 2010 with the
acquisition of 333 pubs from Mitchells & Butlers and, through a series of strategic acquisitions, including the Ei
Acquisition, we are now the largest pub company in the United Kingdom. Since 2010, we have acquired
businesses and assets in order to geographically diversify our presence across the United Kingdom, providing
exposure to regional markets and a number of operating models, formats and brands that provide a diverse and
resilient financial profile. We continually evaluate opportunities to strategically acquire individual sites in
situations where those sites are a particularly good fit for our existing business.

We have a strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties, approximately 81%
by number of Group sites and approximately 90% by value (as of September 24, 2023) and a Group property asset
value of £4.1 billion (as of September 24, 2023). Within Stonegate Group, which has a property asset value of
£3.2 billion (as of September 24, 2023), our freehold estate comprises approximately 76% by number of sites and
approximately 88% by value, in each case as of September 24, 2023. We have a strong presence in London and
the southeast region of the United Kingdom and have diverse operating models, formats and brands.

Our revenue is generated from a variety of sources, including drink sales (76.7% and 77.2% of our Group’s
consolidated revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024) and food
sales (10.4% and 9.8% of our Group’s consolidated revenue in the same periods). We believe that our diverse,
resilient and agile business across operating models, formats and brands, led by our experienced and reputed
management team, is instrumental in driving our revenue growth. Our Group’s revenue, operating profit, and loss
after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 were £1,719 million, £68 million
and £155 million, respectively, and for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024 it was £916 million, £190 million and
£4 million. Stonegate Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 was £1,594 million and Stonegate
Group Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended April 7, 2024 would have been £411.6 million.

The pubs and bars sector in the UK experienced significant disruption due to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic and the subsequent government intervention, which resulted in the temporary closure of pubs and bars,
severely impacted trading in 2020 and 2021. However, according to CGA, the pubs and bars sector in the UK has,
in the year ended December 31, 2023, recovered to similar levels as measured by sales as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with pub companies experiencing particularly strong
trading in the past 12 months.

We operate three main business segments: Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run:

  - _Leased and Tenanted: Within our Leased and Tenanted segment, Pub Partnership is our principal_
business activity following the completion of the Ei Acquisition. In addition, this segment also includes
commercial properties which consist of free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties that are operated and
managed by third-party leaseholders on arms-length agreements. A key feature of the Pub Partnership
operating model is the tie arrangement, whereby most Pub Partners have agreed under their lease or
tenancy agreements to purchase beer and other beverages through us. The tie arrangements, along with
rental income, provide us with resilient and recurring earnings. As of April 7, 2024, the Group has 3,019
Leased and Tenanted pubs, which includes 1,985 Leased and Tenanted pubs in the Stonegate Group with
the remaining 1,034 pubs in the Platinum Group.

  - _Managed Pubs: Our Managed pubs are owned and operated by us and derive their income predominantly_
from the retail sale of food and drinks, accommodation and gaming machines. We believe this segment
allows us to take advantage of the pubs we believe have a significant upside potential through direct
management by experienced pub managers and pub operators. Our Managed pubs are strategically
positioned to cater to different customer demographics, trends and occasions. Our Managed pubs are
classified into nine formats, Bars & Venues, Be At One, Popworld, Premium, Proper Pubs, Pub & Dining,

110


-----

Slug & Lettuce, Social Pub & Kitchen and Sports Bar & Grill. In addition, within our Managed Pubs
business segment, we also have entered into 48 joint ventures with experienced retail partners. As of
April 7, 2024, we had 803 pubs operating within our Managed segment, all within the Stonegate Group.

  - _Operator-run Pubs: The Operator-run pubs are run by self-employed operators under our guidelines for_
managed pub operations, with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but typically a limited
food offering. The self-employed operator is paid a fixed percentage of revenue and is responsible for
employing all of the on-site staff. Accordingly, we benefit from low levels of operational gearing,
resulting in resilient earnings, downside protection and proportionally lower central costs to operate
Operator-run pubs. We operate these pubs under the Craft Union format, with one clear retail offer that
is drinks-led with quality beers at affordable prices, served in local, well-invested facilities, with audio
visual equipment for sports and entertainment. We believe that the structure of the Operator-run model
supports superior return on capital investment, as well as provides for higher levels of downside
protection given that we retain all revenue and meet all costs (other than staff costs, which are paid by a
self-employed operator who receives a percentage of revenue in order to do so). As of April 7, 2024, we
had 584 pubs operating within our Operator-run segment, all within the Stonegate Group.

**Our Strengths**

Our key credit strengths include the following:

**_Attractive and stable market, growing with a shrinking pub footprint_**

Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK pubs and bars market demonstrated stable long-term
growth, increasing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.0% between 2015 and 2019 to reach a
total industry revenue level of approximately £29.5 billion in 2019. Following two years of disrupted business
and operations due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK pubs and bars market recovered to preCOVID- 19 levels in 2022, and CGA forecasts growth in the sector to be approximately 2.8% during the period
from 2023 to 2029. We expect that this stable market growth, coupled with a continued reduction in the number
of establishments in the sector, to be beneficial to the remaining establishments such as the Group.

We believe that we are also well-placed to benefit from the supportive supply-demand dynamics in both the
“drink-led” (or “wet”) and “food-led” (or “dry”) segments of the on-trade market (i.e. consumer businesses that
hold a license to sell alcohol on the premises). As shown below, the number of sites in the UK has declined from
2015 to 2023 by approximately 8,400 sites, with the decline in pubs and bars exacerbated during the COVID-19
impacted period. On the other hand, over the same period, the pubs and bars wet and dry market value has increased
by approximately £4.4 billion, thereby increasing the effective revenue per site by approximately £203,000 from
£509,000 in 2015 to £712,000 in 2023. According to CGA, the effective revenue per site is estimated to further
increase by 27% to £907,000 from 2023 to 2029.

The UK pubs and bars market has experienced downward trending wet volumes, impacted by the change in
alcohol consumption between different generations. According to the NHS health survey, alcohol consumption
has fallen among younger generations by approximately 15-22% from 2011 to 2021, although this has been
partially offset by an increase in alcohol consumption by older generations of approximately 5-11%. CGA
estimates that wet volumes during the period between 2023 and 2029 will remain relatively stable. However, as
a consequence of a declining number of sites, wet volumes per establishment are expected to increase at 10%
to 49 kL in 2029.

**_UK’s largest pub company benefitting from economies of scale_**

We have a high-quality and sustainable pub and bar estate. The quality of our estate is evident in our geographic
distribution and overall profile of our pubs. Our pubs are favorably weighted towards more suburban and rural
areas as well as towards London and areas in the southeast region of the United Kingdom. Additionally, our pubs
have diverse operating models, formats and brands, which we believe provides higher rental income and higher
drink sales based on a higher volume.

Our position as the United Kingdom’s largest pub company affords the business significant benefits of scale in
comparison to smaller pub companies in the United Kingdom. In terms of negotiating procurement terms, we
benefit from enhanced bargaining power with suppliers and service providers as a result of our size and
purchasing volume. In terms of operating leverage, we have higher revenue potential as our portfolio absorbs
the fixed costs associated with a pub company more effectively. Our operational expertise is a key benefit of
our scale, as it allows us to disseminate operational best practices across our estate to increase profitability, as
well as to access substantial data to inform key decisions such as strategic pricing and promotional initiatives.
Additionally, the size of our estate creates significant headroom for operational improvement across our portfolio
and value accretive capital opportunities, including the ability to convert and carry out expansionary
refurbishment, and the breadth of our portfolio allows for an efficient allocation of resources, where investment
is directed towards the highest returning opportunities.

Our diversification and significant scale position us to compete more effectively than other market participants,
delivering greater value to our stakeholders, including tenants, employees, customers and local communities.

**_Proven platform with a resilient, multi-offering business model_**

Our business is divided across three reporting segments, acting as a landlord for the Leased and Tenanted segment,
a proprietary pub operator for the Managed Pubs segment and a partner for third party operators for the Operatorrun segment.

As we are flexible in applying the format best suited to the demographic trends or customer base of a certain area,
we are able to overlay the appropriate brands and formats across our portfolio to maximize the performance of
our estate. Our multiple formats allow us to maintain a significant presence in growing cities without adversely
affecting sales at our pubs in adjacent locations, as compared to single-format operators that are limited to catering
to select target groups. Thanks to our multiple formats, we are also able to target a wide customer demographic
while being able to cater to various consumer trends.

Our multi-format platform brings diversity in terms of income sources (rental income, wholesale drink sales
and retail drink and food sales), locations (distribution throughout the United Kingdom with a weighting in


113


-----

more profitable areas such as London and the southeast region of the United Kingdom), operating models
(Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run).

**_High-quality and primarily freehold real estate portfolio_**

Our Group has a strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties,
approximately 81% by number of sites and approximately 90% (as of September 24, 2023) and a property asset
value of approximately £4.1 billion (as of September 24, 2023).

The estate is weighted towards rural and suburban locations, and the majority of its holdings also benefit from
being in the southern region of England, with approximately 53% of the Group’s estate as of September 24,
2023 located in that region where property prices are generally higher than the rest of the United Kingdom. Our
portfolio is well invested in with significant levels of capital expenditure, with a spend of £144 million, £140
million, £53 million on Capital Expenditure in the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, 52 weeks ended
September 25, 2022 and 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021, respectively.

Our Group has a strong track record of disposing of properties above book value and from September 28, 2020
to April 7, 2024, has disposed of 290 sites at, on average, a 23.6% premium to book value. This continues the
pre- acquisition track record of the Ei Group, who, in the ten financial years ending on September 30, 2019,
disposed of 3,371 properties at a premium to book value of 19.9%.

**_Highly experienced, best-in-class management team_**

We have a highly experienced and stable senior management team, with significant relevant experience and
complementary skill sets in the retail, leisure and service sectors. Our board of directors is comprised of David
McDowall (Chief Executive Officer), David Ross (Chief Financial Officer), Brian Magnus (Senior Partner at
TDR Capital), Hassan Adel ElGazzar (Partner at TDR Capital) and Mark Davies (Non-Executive Director).

Our Group is led by our Chief Executive Officer, David McDowall, who has over 25 years of experience in the
retail and hospitality sector. Prior to joining us in January 2023, David was at the innovative brewer and bar
operator BrewDog, first as chief executive officer of the bars business, before holding a wider role as the
president and chief operating officer, overseeing the strategic direction and day-to-day operations of the business
in the United Kingdom and internationally. Prior to BrewDog, David was the group operations director at G1
Group, a leading Scottish hospitality operator. Our Chief Financial Officer, David Ross, has served in that capacity
since January 2012 and has over 20 years of experience in the retail industry. David qualified as a chartered
accountant with PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 1999, and before joining us, had held various senior roles at Boots,
Spirit Group, Laurel Pub Company, Bay Restaurant Group and Town and City Pub Group. Mark Davies has
joined us as a non-executive Director in June 2024. Mark is currently the chief executive officer of Primary
Healthcare Properties, a FTSE 250 UK real estate investment trust, and a non-executive director of Palace
Capital, a regional focused REIT. Mark was previously a co-founder and chief executive officer of NewRiver
REIT and Hawthorn Community Pub Company, which was sold to Admiral Taverns in 2021. Our management,
who we believe are the architects of the managed business model in the United Kingdom, have the knowledge,
skill set and experience required to run the largest pub company in the United Kingdom.

Our Group continues to have strong sponsor backing from TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm with over
€15 billion of assets under management. In July 2020, TDR Capital contributed equity of £50 million to support
the business in light of the challenges presented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that TDR Capital’s
active support, combined with the depth of our management’s industry experience, provides for efficient
decision-making and insightful leadership for our Group.

**Our Strategies**

As the business has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and is now operating in a steady
state, we intend to pursue the strategies set out below to take advantage of the attractive supply and demand
market dynamics.

**_Business as usual_**

 - _Leased and Tenanted: Within our Leased and Tenanted segment, we plan to operate the Pub Partnership_
business, our main business, in its existing form. We believe that the estate is of high quality, having
been shaped into a strong and profitable business by strategically disposing of underperforming, smaller

114


-----

and secondary assets over time. We intend to continue to invest in the Leased and Tenanted portfolio to
ensure that our Pub Partners have the infrastructure that they require to provide the best customer
experience and to increase site profitability, ensuring the resilience of our income.

 - _Managed Pubs: Our strategy for the Managed Pubs business includes continued capital investments,_
responsiveness to industry trends, pricing improvements, labor efficiency and the implementation of
operational best practices across our estate.

 - _Operator-run: We continue to leverage our Managed Pub expertise in our Operator-run estate,_
combining best practice from Managed Pubs in a format where there is limited operational gearing.
We will continue to be innovative with the formats deployed, focusing primarily on the proven Craft
Union format.

**_Asset optimization strategy_**

We intend to maintain our commitment to asset optimization through capital investment and to capital recycling
through disposals, as we continue to improve our business performance and further increase our market share.
We have a sizeable pipeline of opportunities in our portfolio, which provides for strong investment and growth
opportunities in the future. Our commitments will be primarily focused on conversions to the Operator- run
model where we can use our flexibility and innovation in ensuring the most suitable format is implemented, in
particular, on converting the majority of applicable pubs to our Craft Union format.

We expect that our capital program going forward will be weighted towards pubs in suburban locations in order
to maximize our returns in the current trading environment. However, the scale of our potential pipeline allows
us to be flexible when selecting investment opportunities and we will remain alert to any changes in underlying
consumer trends and adjust our capital investment strategy accordingly, to the extent necessary. We intend to
capitalize on our ability to deliver market-leading operating performance across the Leased and Tenanted,
Managed Pubs and Operator-run models, particularly in light of the value creation opportunities provided by the
low operating leverage inherent in the Operator-run model. These strategies are discussed in more detail below.

Supported by our established asset management function, assuming a steady state of business and in line with
our strategy to invest in value enhancing operating models, we currently expect to convert approximately 50
pubs a year over the next 6 years from the Leased and Tenanted segment to mainly the Operator-run and a few
to the Managed Pubs segment. We have been historically successfully in converting our pubs between operating
format, with a historical record of approximately 40% return on investment for conversions during the 156
weeks ended April 7, 2024.

_Expand the Operator-run model to capture retail economics_

We believe we can create value by improving the existing Craft Union pubs and converting suitable Leased and
Tenanted pubs into the Craft Union format. We estimate that we will invest, on average, approximately £150,000
to £200,000 per pub to convert Leased and Tenanted pubs into Operator-run pubs, with high performing Leased
and Tenanted sites selected for this conversion, which benefits from the labor cost arbitrage of the tenanted
model and allows for greater control of investment, format and operations. The conversion allows us to capture
the full retail margin on food and drink sales, whilst minimizing exposure to labor costs. This would allow us
to capture Operator-run retail economics, in which we are targeting an estimated return on investment of
approximately 41% as illustrated in the chart below.

_conversion, although at the individual pubs level, a range around this average level is generally expected. References to “EBITDA” in the_
_illustration above are to pre-adjusted EBITDA._

As illustrated above, to achieve a pre-adjusted EBITDA uplift of approximately £80,000 per pub, on conversion,
we believe we can benefit from approximately £450,000 of captured retail economics of the Operator-run format,
and enhancing revenue potential through optimal bar management. This is then offset by increased labor and pubs
costs of approximately £260,000, together with the forgone rent and operator fees of approximately £110,000.

Operator-run pubs are run by self-employed operators who receive a fixed percentage of the revenue generated
at these pubs and are responsible for organizing and paying staff. This operating model provides the benefits of
a Managed Pub model, in terms of control over investments, formats and operations (e.g., in areas of pricing and
marketing), together with the capture of retail economics, while also providing certain benefits of the Leased
and Tenanted model, in terms of allocating responsibility to the pub operator for labor, staffing and other costs.
These pubs tend to be drink-led with no food offering and have a sports focus. We believe that the Craft Union
format is particularly well suited for drink-led pubs with lower revenues.

_Conversions from Leased and Tenanted to Managed Pubs_

We expect to convert a number of Leased and Tenanted pubs into Managed Pubs. Our Leased and Tenanted
estate provides a large pipeline for these conversions and we currently expect to convert approximately 5 pubs
a year from Leased and Tenanted to Managed Pubs.

We generally expect these conversions to result in higher profitability. Above a minimum level of sales,
Managed Pubs typically generate incremental profit on a unit basis when compared to a Leased and Tenanted
pub by capturing profit that would otherwise have been retained by tied publicans in the Leased and Tenanted
model. Additionally, through our capital investments program, whereby we estimate we will invest, on average,
approximately £300,000 to £350,000 per pub to implement these conversions, we are targeting an estimated
return on investment of approximately 20% as illustrated in the chart below.

_conversion, although at the individual pubs level, a range around this average level is generally expected. References to “EBITDA” in the_
_illustration above are to pre-adjusted EBITDA._

As illustrated above, to achieve a pre-adjusted EBITDA uplift of approximately £160,000 per pub, on
conversion, we benefit from approximately £995,000 of captured retail economics of the publican, and
enhancing revenue potential through optimal bar management. This is then offset by increased labor and pubs
cost of approximately £800,000, together with foregone rent of approximately £35,000.

_Conversions from Managed Pubs to Operator-run_

We expect to convert a number of Managed pubs into Operator-run pubs. We generally expect these conversions to
result in higher profitability by realizing the opportunity to capture cost savings from Managed pubs with low average
weekly take (“AWT”) and limited food sales, while retaining the full margin on drinks sales. We consider Managed
pubs generating approximately £10,000 to £12,000 in AWT, of which approximately £1,000 is related to food sales,
to be low in AWT. Additionally, through our capital investments program, whereby we estimate we will invest, on
average, approximately £50,000 to £100,000 per pub to implement these conversions, we are targeting an estimated
return on investment of approximately 35% as illustrated in the chart below.

_Note: Illustrative example shows average to the nearest £5,000 from management’s estimated profit and loss for typical pubs post conversion,_
_although at the individual pubs level, a range around this average level is generally expected. References to “EBITDA” in the illustration above_
_are to pre-adjusted EBITDA._

As illustrated above, to achieve a pre-adjusted EBITDA uplift of approximately £110,000 per pub, on conversion,
we benefit from approximately £305,000 of labor cost savings and £235,000 of wider pub cost savings. This is then
offset by operator fees of approximately £90,000 and reduced retail economics of approximately £340,000.

_Expansions_

In addition to the conversions, an important aspect of our asset optimization strategy going forward is
concentrated on investing in the refurbishment and upgrading of assets in the existing estate. The strategy
includes each of the Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run segments, with a total of
approximately 300 to 400 sites a year, at a cost of approximately £30 to £40 million each year.

The strategy is predominantly focused on the Leased and Tenanted estate, targeting approximately 250 planned
expansions a year over the next 6 years, with management intending on accelerating its investment into the
Leased and Tenanted division beginning in the 2025 financial year. During the 156 weeks ended April 7, 2024,
expansion schemes in the Leased and Tenanted segment have delivered approximately 68% return on investment. The
average expenditure for the planned expansions is approximately £30,000 per Leased and Tenanted site until
2029 (with an annual increase in line with 2.5% inflation). Additionally, we are planning on targeting
approximately 100 Operator-run or Managed Pubs expansions a year over the next 6 years.

_Disposals_

Disposals are a key pillar of our asset optimization strategy. In addition to planned sale-and-leaseback of selected
Managed Pubs sites, we aim to opportunistically crystallize value through selective site disposals, which
predominantly consist of sites that are no longer core to our conversions or expansions strategy.

The disposal strategy contributes to our business strategic objectives of deleveraging, funding growth capital
expenditure and providing an opportunity to crystalize value at attractive multiples. From September 28, 2020
to April 7, 2024, we have received a total of £158.4 million in disposal proceeds, with a total of 290 sites disposed
of at run-rate multiples of 22.7x.

**_Continuous Optimization Initiatives of Business Operations_**

We continuously focus on delivering optimization through a number of business initiatives outlined below.

_Pricing_

Pricing is a key component of ensuring we continue to improve our margins, which has been particularly key to
our overall strategic objectives given the inflationary environment in the United Kingdom in the last 2 years, with
Consumer Price Index inflation reaching a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Our current pricing strategy focuses
on offsetting cost inflation by raising prices via data-led strategic increases in our Managed Pubs and Operatorrun segments and maximizing price levers within the Leased and Tenanted segment.

For the Operator-run segment, we believe our pricing is currently below our peers’ pricing. Therefore, in the
near term, we are planning on capitalizing on price headroom to deliver strong price increases during the second
half of 2024, alongside a longer-term strategy to increase prices marginally ahead of inflation. For the Managed
Pubs segment, the higher-end positioning of the Managed Pubs business enables longer-term price increases

117


-----

above inflation, driven by premiumization trends. For our Leased and Tenanted business, price increases are
implemented through yearly price reviews in April and are limited to CPI inflation plus 3%. Additionally, the
pricing of the rental component of the Leased and Tenanted income is supported by predominantly index linked
tenancy agreements, which implement rent increases with inflation.

_Media_

We realize the potential for use of digitalization and technology to enhance our Group’s performance and
improve our margins. Our media strategy is focused on two key initiatives, first, the “Media” initiative, which
involves the installation of digital advertising screens at our Managed sites, and second, the MiXR App, which
is a cross portfolio loyalty application that engages customers across multiple brands.

The Media component of our strategy involves installing of digital advertising screens to exhibit promotional
content at Managed sites. We aim to have installed digital advertising screens at approximately 800 selected
sites by November 2024. The screens will feature premium brands to enhance the increasing trend of
premiumization among our customers, whereby customer demand for premium drink categories has been
growing, particularly for premium lager and craft beer. The screens will also provide additional revenue from
third-party advertising media sales and content.

The MiXR App is a newly launched loyalty application designed to encourage customers to pre-book visits to
pubs in our estate, as well as display our promotional initiatives. The application has been popular since its release,
with downloads continuing to perform ahead of the rate required to achieve our target of 1.5 million downloads by
September 2024. The MiXR App is designed to increase customer loyalty to our pub estate and increase the
frequency of visits by customers.

_Cost Rationalization_

We continue to focus on improving our margins, of which cost rationalization is a key part of the wider strategy.
Significant progress has been made towards the operational improvement of our business, in particular, cost
rationalization in our head office functions, in addition to further initiatives in place to support long-term
strategic initiatives. As part of our cost rationalization strategy, we are also focused on simplifying our overall
structure, including increased spans of control, automation of processes where applicable and cost reductions.

_Energy_

Wholesale energy prices increased rapidly from the second half of 2021 and into 2023 as a consequence of a
supply-demand imbalance, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Following this period of
volatile and elevated energy costs, we have taken steps to reduce energy consumption and otherwise mitigate
the impact of energy price volatility across our estate. There was a spike in prices during December 2022, but
prices fell back in early 2023 and have remained at levels well below their 2022 peak. However, they still remain
above their pre ‘energy crisis’ levels.

The pricing component of the energy strategy is focused on hedging energy prices to mitigate the impact of
volatility in future energy prices, with the Group hedging almost 100% and 75% of our expected electricity usage
for summer and winter 2024 and 98% and 78% of our expected gas usage for summer and winter 2024.
Additionally, to reduce consumption, we conduct periodic trainings and communication initiatives for our staff to
support reduced energy consumption.

**History**

We were incorporated in August 2010 in connection with our acquisition of approximately 333 pubs,
predominantly freehold, from Mitchells & Butlers and began our trading operations in November 2010. We have
since grown in size and scale through a series of strategic acquisitions. In 2011, we acquired Town & City, which
owned 226 leasehold pubs, thereby growing our geographical presence in the UK and helping us to develop our
formats to cover a wider demographic catchment. In 2013, we acquired 12 pubs from Living Room, which allowed
us to strengthen our presence in some of the major cities across the UK, including London, Manchester, Liverpool,
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol. Again in 2013, through our acquisition of 78 pubs from Bramwell Pub Company,
we were able to further grow our reach within the UK, particularly in cities and towns where we did not have an
existing presence. In 2015, we acquired 15 pubs from Maclay, which allowed us to expand our presence in the
major cities and towns of Scotland, and we agreed to acquire 53 hand-picked pubs from TCG, allowing us to

118


-----

continue to strengthen our presence throughout the UK. In December 2016, we acquired Intertain, which operated
30 pubs across the UK predominantly under the Walkabout brand, a dedicated sports format popular with
millennials, expanding our reach to town and cities where previously we did not have any sites, such as Carlisle
and Lichfield. In 2017, we selectively acquired 13 pubs from JDW and acquired three central London pubs from
the Faucet Inn Sellers. In 2018 and 2019, we acquired 33 pubs pursuant to the Be At One Acquisition, 15 pubs
pursuant to the First Novus Acquisitions, 32 pubs pursuant to the Fever Bars Acquisition and six pubs pursuant
to the Second Novus Acquisitions. In addition, on March 3, 2020 we completed the Ei Acquisition, acquiring an
additional 4,028 pubs and combining Ei Group’s operation with ours. We continually evaluate opportunities to
acquire individual sites in situations where those sites are a particularly good fit for our existing business.

**Business Segments**

We operate three main business segments: Leased and Tenanted, Managed Pubs and Operator-run.

**_Leased and Tenanted_**

We acquired our Leased and Tenanted business segment pursuant to the Ei Acquisition. Within our Leased and
Tenanted segment, Pub Partnership is our principal business activity following the completion of the Ei
Acquisition, operating public houses under the Leased and Tenanted pub model. As of April 7, 2024, we had
2,711 pubs under the Pub Partnership model. Under our Leased and Tenanted business, we grant leases to, or
enter into tenancy agreements with, Pub Partners who operate the pubs as their own businesses and who must pay
rent and purchase beer and other drinks from us (or suppliers nominated by us) and enter into income sharing
arrangements with us in relation to income generated from leisure machines.

We have a shared interest with our Pub Partners in the success of the pubs they operate. In the equilibrium of
trade, in line with the expectations of both parties, the drink and dry rents are together aimed at representing a fair
return and payment for the use of the property. If we and the Pub Partner cooperate to increase alcoholic drinks
sales, then both parties will benefit from the higher profits. If the Pub Partner struggles and fewer alcoholic drinks
are sold, we, as landlord, will receive less drink rent and the Pub Partner will enjoy a lower effective rent.

We provide support to Pub Partners through a package of flexible lease agreements, capital investments and
proactive intervention of regional managers. In addition, we offer our Pub Partners a broad range of businessbuilding services to help them increase sales and reduce costs, and to operate their pubs efficiently and effectively.
Reducing the instances of business failure is one of our key strategies to maintain and grow revenue performance
as failures have usually had a significant impact on their income. As a result of our temporary concessions and
support to Pub Partners as well as a history of disposing of underperforming pubs, we have experienced an
improvement in the overall quality of the estate and a decline in pub failures.

The ability to mitigate the financial risks faced by Pub Partners during periods of economic challenge is a unique
attribute of the Pub Partnership business model. The proactive intervention of our regional managers to identify
and then avoid potential business failures is particularly important when Pub Partners are likely to be facing cost
pressures. The current inflationary macro-economic environment and cost of living crisis in the UK, exacerbated
by the war in Ukraine which has driven up energy and food prices in particular, has continued to pressure the
trading environment of our Pub Partners. While our Pub Partners have received benefits under government relief
schemes, such as the scheme to support energy bills of pubs and other businesses with a discount on business
energy unit rates, we have taken pro-active measures to support our Pub Partners. For instance, we have initiated
temporary concessions and discretionary support where short term cash flow is more challenging. As a result of
these initiatives, business failures across our Pub Partnership estate has remained low, at 2.4% the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 and 1.9% for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024.

In addition, we also have free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties operated and managed by third-party
leaseholders on an arms-length agreement and as of April 7, 2024, we had 308 commercial properties, which are
traded as free-of-tie pubs. Following the completion of the Platinum Transaction, pursuant to which we have
transferred 1,034 pubs to the Platinum Group, Stonegate Group has, as of April 7, 2024, 1,985 Leased and
Tenanted pubs, consisting of 218 free-of-tie pubs and 1,767 tied pubs.

This business manages a developing portfolio of assets which we lease out to third parties on commercial property
terms and derives its income predominantly from rental payments and contributes to the diversification of earnings
by providing another source of recurring rental income.

**_Managed Pubs_**

Our Managed Pubs segment is comprised in its majority by pubs that are owned and operated by us. Therefore,
this segment allows us to take advantage of the pubs we believe have a significant upside potential through direct
management by experienced pub managers and pub operators. As of April 7, 2024, we had 803 Managed pubs (of
which 755 are Managed pubs operated by us and 48 are pubs operated pursuant to certain joint ventures entered
into by us with experienced retail partners). As these businesses are wholly or jointly owned and operated by us,
we directly benefit from revenue generated by their operation, including revenue from the sale of food, drinks and
accommodation and gaming machine income.

Our Managed pubs are managed on a regional basis with 52 area managers supporting seven operational directors,
as of April 7, 2024, who report to one managing director. Each pub is managed by a general manager is
incentivized to maximize profit through a bonus scheme.

Our Managed pubs are classified into nine formats, Bars & Venues, Be At One, Popworld, Premium, Proper Pubs,
Pub & Dining, Slug & Lettuce, Social Pub & Kitchen and Sports Bar & Grill. Our nine formats represent the
diversity of our offering, our wide geographical reach within the UK and our broad customer base. By operating
our Managed pubs through a multi-format strategy, we believe we have strategically positioned ourselves across
a wide range of consumer demographics, trends and occasions.

The table below presents a summary of our formats through which we operate.

79 The Slug and Lettuce brand is
an inclusive, female friendly,

food.

138 Individually crafted pubs, with
extensive cocktails, gin, craft
beer and food offerings, with
locations across the UK.

7 London-based sports bars, split
between transport hubs and
high streets, including
Clubhouses.


In addition, as of April 7, 2024, we also have 48 joint ventures with experienced retail partners. Under this
partnership model, we are allowed to work with carefully selected Managed pub operators to share in the benefits
of trading in certain high quality and specialist retail segments. This business predominantly operates in premium
consumer segments with attractive price elasticity and is therefore better able to mitigate the inflationary pressure
that is especially challenging for more value-oriented, food-led businesses.

During the integration of acquired pubs, we focus on achieving cost synergies and format integration. Starting
with our original acquisition of pubs from Mitchells & Butlers in August 2010 and from Town & City in June
2011, we have successfully managed the transition of pubs from Ember Inns, Vintage Inns, Toby Carvery, Crown
Carvery, Harvester, Scream, Living Room, Maclay and TCG, as well as of unbranded pubs and venues, into our
existing formats. Further, we fully integrated into our current formats the pubs we acquired from Intertain, Large
Bars, Faucet Inns, Ei Group (pursuant to the asset acquisitions from them in 2017) and Punch Taverns.
Furthermore, we have fully integrated into our current brands and formats the pubs we acquired pursuant to the
First Novus Acquisitions, Second Novus Acquisitions, the Fever Bar Acquisitions and the Be At One Acquisition.
Pursuant to the Ei Acquisition, in addition to conversion to Operator-run formats, we have also converted, and
plan to continue to convert select Leased and Tenanted pubs to Managed.

**_Operator-run_**

Our Operator-run pubs are run by self-employed operators under our guidelines for Managed pub operations, with
a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but limited food offering. The self-employed operator is paid
a fixed percentage of revenue (typically around 19.5%) and is responsible for employing all the on-site staff and
as such we benefit from low levels of operational gearing, resulting in resilient earnings and a superior return on
capital investment, downside protection and proportionally lower central costs to operate our Operator- run pubs.

The Craft Union format, under which these pubs are run, has national coverage as a leading scale operator of
community pubs, with one clear retail offer that is drinks-led with quality beers, at affordable prices, served in
local, well-invested facilities, with audio visual equipment for sports and entertainment. Trading with limited
branding, Craft Union pubs have the look and feel of a local pub in the heart of communities. These pubs generally
offer no food, and instead focus on a sports and entertainment drink-led retail offer. They are run by self-employed

121


-----

operators who receive a percentage of the revenue generated in these pubs and who are responsible for employing
all staff in order to manage the day to day operations of the pubs, resulting in a proportionally lower central cost.

As of April 7, 2024, we had 584 pubs operating within our Operator-run segment.

We expect to continue to drive value by converting a number of pubs in our Leased and Tenanted segment to our
Operator-run segment, and thereby potentially increase the number of pubs that are run based on this model.

**Our Offering**

**_Drinks Offering_**

Our drinks sales, which include drink sales to customers in our Managed and Operator-run pubs and to our Pub
Partners in respect of our Leased and Tenanted pubs, made up 76.7% and 77.2% of our consolidated revenue for
the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024.

For our Managed and Operator-run businesses, we generally pass through drink price rises annually in April,
coinciding with alcohol duty increases in the UK. The government in the UK imposed a duty escalator which
commenced in April 23, 2009, pursuant to which duties on alcohol rise each year by 2% above the rate of inflation
(based on RPI). This duty escalation was removed from beer in the March 2013 budget and from spirits, wine and
made-wine, cider and perry in the March 2014 budget, while the March 2015 budget subsequently reduced duty
rates on beer, spirits and lower and high-strength cider, and froze duty rates on wine below 22% alcohol by volume
and high-strength sparkling cider. In the March 2016 budget, duty rates on wine and made-wine at or below 22%
alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by volume rose at the same rate as RPI
inflation, but the UK government froze in cash terms the duty rates on beer, spirits and other drinks above 22%
alcohol by volume and still cider and lower strength sparkling cider. In the March 2017 budget, the duty rates on
alcohol manufactured in, or imported into, the UK rose at the same rate as forecast RPI inflation, and in the
November 2017 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders were frozen. In the October 2018
budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders remained frozen but specifically duty rates on wine
and made-wine at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by
volume rose at the same rate as RPI inflation.

In 2021, the UK government announced a new alcohol duty rates system based on alcohol by volume (“ABV”)
(replacing the previous system organized by drink classification). As of August 1, 2023, an increase in applicable
alcohol duty rates came into effect under the revised duty structure for alcohol products in line with RPI inflation.
Alcohol duty rates on beer, cider and wine were frozen following the Autumn 2020 budget. In order to provide
certainty to businesses, on November 22, 2023, the government extended the alcohol duty freeze to August 1,
2024, and on March 6, 2024 the government further extended the alcohol duty freeze to February 1, 2025. For
risks related to potential increases in alcohol duties to which we are subject, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Business—Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which_
_we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business—The taxes and duties to which we are subject_
_may increase.”_

**_Food Offering_**

As of April 7, 2024, approximately 81% of our Managed pubs offered both food and drinks. We have established
strict standards and specifications for the food we source for our Managed pubs to help us ensure the quality and
consistency of the food products sold. The mix of food and drink sales at our Managed pubs varies over the course
of the day. On average, at these pubs, food accounted for 29.6% and 29.5% of all pre-6:00 p.m. sales across our
Managed pubs for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively.
Our food sales made up 10.4% and 9.8% of our consolidated revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023
and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively. Although drinks sales are the main focus of our Managed
Pubs business, food offering helps us maximize profitability.

For our Managed Pubs, we change food menus twice a year, once during spring and once during autumn, passing
through any price changes at the same time. We attempt to remain current with, and continue to effectively
address, customer preferences and consumer trends in the food and drink market. For our Managed Pubs, we also
review our food and drink inventory and supply management on an ongoing basis to ensure that our Managed
Pubs offering is responsive to customer demand and to changing customer and industry trends. For risks related
to our inability to keep up with these preferences and trends, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—

_Consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to drinks and food may continue to change and we may be_
_unable to adapt to such changes.”_

**_Other_**

Our other sales, which include sales from amusement, admission fees, accommodation, gaming machines and
other sales (excluding rent revenue), made up 6.1% and 6.0% of our consolidated revenue for the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023 and the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024, respectively.

**Our Property Estate**

**_Geographical Presence_**

Our pubs have a geographically diversified footprint across the UK that consisted of 4,414 sites as of April 7,
2024, with a strong presence in London and the southeast region of the UK. Following the completion of the
Platinum Transaction, pursuant to which have transferred 1,034 sites to the Platinum Group, Stonegate Group’s
estate consists of 3,380 sites, approximately 45% of which are located in town centers and approximately 55%
being located in rural or suburban locations.

We review our geographical footprint on an ongoing basis. In 2013, we acquired 12 pubs from Living Room,
which allowed us to strengthen our presence in some of the major cities across the UK, including London,
Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol. Further, in 2013, through our acquisition of 78 pubs
from Bramwell, we were able to further grow our reach within the UK, particularly in cities and towns where we
did not yet have an existing presence. In 2015, we acquired 15 pubs from Maclay, which has allowed us to expand
our presence in the major cities and towns of Scotland, and in September 2015 we agreed to acquire 53 pubs from
TCG, allowing us to continue to strengthen our presence throughout the UK. In December 2016, we acquired
Intertain, which owned and operated 30 pubs across the UK predominantly under the Walkabout brand, a
dedicated sports format popular with millennials, expanding our reach to towns and cities where previously we
did not have any sites, such as Carlisle and Lichfield. In addition, we have also selectively acquired 13 pubs from
JDW and acquired three central London pubs from the Faucet Inn Sellers, and we continually evaluate
opportunities to acquire individual sites in situations where those sites are a particularly good fit for our existing
business.

In July 2018, we completed the Be At One Acquisition pursuant to which we acquired 33 bars spread across
central London (approximately 34%), outer London (approximately 19%) and regionally in the UK
(approximately 47%), and in December 2018, we completed the acquisition of the last of the 15 pubs acquired
under the First Novus Acquisitions and located in attractive areas of London with a high footfall such as the City
of London, the West End and Soho. In January 2019, we acquired 32 pubs pursuant to the Fever Bars Acquisition
located in certain towns and cities in the UK, such as Tunbridge Wells, Redditch and Basingstoke, and in a
majority of these locations, we have limited or no presence. In addition, in January 2019, we also acquired six
pubs pursuant to the Second Novus Acquisitions. The six sites acquired pursuant to the Second Novus
Acquisitions are in attractive locations in the business and financial districts of London such as St. Mary Axe,
Tooley Street, Canary Wharf and Bishopsgate. Following the completion of the Ei Acquisition, Ei Group as the
largest portfolio manager of pubs and Leased and Tenanted pub owner in the UK at such time, contributed an
additional 4,028 pubs.

**_Freehold and Leasehold Properties_**

As of April 7, 2024, approximately 81% of our pubs are freehold, comprising 3,582 pubs, approximately 2% are
long leasehold (with 50 years or more remaining under the lease term), comprising 105 pubs and approximately
17% are short leasehold (with less than 50 years remaining under the lease term), comprising 727 pubs. According
to valuations by Avison Young, the market value of our, Stonegate Group’s and Unique Group’s freehold
properties as of September 24, 2023 is approximately £3.73 billion, £2.80 billion and £1.42 billion, respectively.
The market value of our, Stonegate Group’s and Unique Group’s total estate is approximately £4.11 billion, £3.18
billion and £1.50 billion, respectively.

With respect to our property portfolio as of April 7, 2024, the majority of leases have five-year rent review cycles.
We are also focused on continuing to monitor our lease agreements to allow us to renegotiate our rental payments
across our estate when possible.

**_Pub Investment Program_**

Since we began trading, and through April 7, 2024, we have refurbished (including expansions and conversions)
approximately 1,992 pubs that we operated, and we continue to invest in our managed estate. We have a focused
real estate investment program and take a disciplined approach to investment appraisal. For our managed estate,
we identify priorities for investment through bi-annual estate reviews and have put in place a multi-stage estate
review to ensure a disciplined approach to investment across our pubs. Sites are identified by analyzing current
performance, consumer trends and capacity opportunities. Investments are then approved through separate
operations, business and board committees. We consider the projected Group Return on Investment in deciding
whether to invest. Following the investment, performance is monitored at board meetings for the following three
years. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to manage cash outflows and preserve and build
liquidity, our ability to make investments in our estate had been limited for some time. During this time, we kept
discretionary spending at a minimum, and have taken a number of other steps to support our cash reserves.
However, with the removal of the remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England from July 19, 2021 onwards and
the gradual return to a steady state of business, we have resumed actively investing in our estate. In particular, for
the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, the Group spent £64 million on Investment Capital Expenditure, as
compared to £55 million during the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and £18 million during the 52 weeks
ended September 26, 2021.

**_Pub Disposal Program_**

Disposals are a key pillar of our strategy to optimize our assets. We analyze each site in the combined estate and
assess its optimal format going forward. Pursuant to this analysis we have identified, and continue to do so an
ongoing basis, Leased and Tenanted sites which could generate more value as Operator-run pubs or Managed
pubs, and sites which could generate more value if disposed of, particularly where those sites may have attractive
alternative use opportunities. We have disposed of 86, 63, 140 and 36 trading sites during the 52 weeks ended
September 24, 2023, 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 and 28 weeks
ended April 7, 2024, respectively.

**_Agreements with our Pub Partners_**

Our relationship with our Pub Partners is generally governed by the type and terms of the lease or tenancy
agreement in place between the Group and the individual Pub Partner. We currently enter into one of two main
categories of such lease or tenancy agreement with our Pub Partners, under which the tied publican operates the
pub as either a lessee or a tenant and agrees to pay the rent specified in the relevant agreement. The two main
categories of our existing leases are: (i) standard lease (up to ten years) and (ii) standard tenancy (majority of
which are for five years). In addition, Ei Group had previously granted 157 agreements with a wider variety of
terms to expiry and they had also inherited some legacy agreements through acquisitions such that the estate
includes lease agreements of between five and 65 years and tenancy agreements of between three and five years.

As part of a lease or tenancy agreement, the tied publican also agrees in most instances that we are to be the sole
supply for certain products. These “tie” arrangements relate primarily to the publican’s purchase of beer, cider,
flavored alcoholic beverages, wines, spirits and minerals, sales of which generally constitute the majority of the
publican’s revenue. In other instances the publican agrees to pay us a tie release fee on an ongoing basis in
exchange for reduced purchase obligations whereby categories of beverages may not be subject to a tie
arrangement.

Standard leases are generally fully repairing, which means that the lessee is responsible for repairs to the premises
during the term of the lease, and are generally fully assignable after two years (subject to our consent, which is
not to be unreasonably withheld). Standard leases generally contain provisions for annual price index rent
adjustments.

Standard tenancies, which are short-term arrangements, involve us undertaking to carry out the majority of
structural repairs to the relevant pub and are generally not assignable and subject to an annual RPI or CPI rent
adjustment. Pub Partners are usually required to provide a deposit on entry into their tenancy agreement. Some
forms of lease and tenancy agreement contain landlord’s or tied publican’s options to break the lease or tenancy.
In addition, there may be circumstances in which we would allow a tied publican to terminate a lease or tenancy
agreement early, as it is in our interest to have a motivated tied publican in our pub.

The use of a lease or tenancy agreement and its terms and conditions vary according to the profit expectations,
risk assessment and plans which we and the publican may have for the pub concerned.

(1) Includes, tenancy-at-will agreements and expired agreements.

Rental income is paid to us weekly, fortnightly, monthly or quarterly in advance or in arrear in accordance with
the type of agreement for the lease or tenancy of a pub by the tied publican. The rent is agreed at the outset of
each lease or tenancy agreement, and, in the case of new leases and tenancies, is based on its open market rental
value.

The majority of our Pub Partnership pubs are subject to rent reviews every five years. Following a rent review,
the rent payable under a lease or tenancy agreement may either increase or decrease. There may also be a rent
review on the last day of the term which effectively provides an initial rent for any renewal lease.

**Supply**

We have developed strong relationships with certain of our key suppliers, which have enabled us to benefit from
attractive pricing terms. Our pubs benefit from shared administrative, supply and logistics functions, thereby
reducing costs and yielding cost synergies, including by giving us greater leverage when negotiating our supply
agreements. We select our food and drink suppliers based on quality, the price of their products and consumer
tastes and preferences.

We purchased the majority of the drink stock from approximately six suppliers during the 28 weeks ended April
7, 2024, with our leading suppliers being Heineken UK, Molson Coors (UK), Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited,
Diageo, Carlsberg and LWC Drinks. The largest drinks supplier was Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited
(accounting for approximately 21.0% of our drink supply cost for the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024) followed by
Heineken UK (accounting for approximately 17.9% of our drink supply cost the 28 weeks ended April 7, 2024.
Since many of our suppliers source the products that they supply in the UK, we have seen limited impact due to
Brexit, which came into effect on January 1, 2021. We have agreed to framework purchasing agreements with our
suppliers with an average term of two years, pursuant to which we make purchase orders when needed. In addition,
we are typically not bound by exclusivity arrangements with suppliers and most of our agreements with suppliers
include a provision that allows us to renegotiate the pricing terms if its estate increases by 10% or more from the
time the contract was entered into. In the past, we have typically been able to use these provisions to negotiate
more favorable pricing terms with its suppliers. A substantial majority of the food supplied is distributed through
one supplier who, in consultation with us, in turn sources food supplies from other suppliers in the market. For
risks related to our dependence on certain suppliers, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We rely

_on a limited number of suppliers and distributors and, if such suppliers continue to consolidate, or face financial_
_difficulties, prices we pay to our suppliers may rise or our operations may be disrupted.”_

**Employees**

As of April 7, 2024, we had 15,129 employees located across the UK. Our number of employees as of the 52
weeks ended September 24, 2023, 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022 and 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021
was 18,023, 19,114 and 15,994, respectively. Our employees are distributed among our various Managed pubs
across the UK, and as of April 7, 2024, we had 1,082 pub support staff employed at the head office in Solihull or
were field-based.

In addition to permanent salaried employees, we also employ temporary or part-time staff, generally on a monthlybasis. All of hourly paid staff receive the National Minimum Wage, the National Living Wage or a slightly higher
rate. General managers have flexibility to pay above the rates set centrally by senior management, as will typically
be the case in London and other large cities. Our employees receive 100% of tips left by customers in order to
demonstrate that they are rewarded for excellent customer service. We do not have zero hours contracts for our
employees. In addition, we operate a bonus scheme for the general managers of our Managed pubs for achieving
profit targets.

**_Staff Training and Development_**

We are focused on the training of our employees, which constitutes one of the main focus points of our
management. We have also initiated programs to improve the caliber of our general managers.

In November 2012, we opened a development center called Albert’s Academy. This center is based in
Birmingham, which is a central location in the UK for our Managed pubs pub-based staff. The center provides a
multi-functional space for learning and development addressing all aspects of our business and includes facilities
such as a state-of-the-art demonstration kitchen and five individual kitchen training pods, alongside two training
rooms and a cellar training facility.

The facility is used as the primary venue for our training programs. We have also introduced an “app” called
Albert’s App to train our staff.

In acknowledgement of our work to date, we were awarded the “HR Manager of the Year” award at the 2019
National Innovation in Training Awards, the “Best Pub Employer” (501 + employees) award at the 2019 and 2020
Publican Awards and we were also awarded the Best New Wellbeing Strategy at the REBA awards in 2020.

In October 2022, we launched a new well-being portal for our employees, which is called “Be you, Be well.” Our
employees can have access to the portal through an app where they can find materials and links to external bodies
and organizations on emotional wellbeing, financial wellbeing and physical wellbeing. Outside of our Group, we
continue our partnership with the Licensed Trade Charity, a non-profit organization that provides employee
assistance to people working in the hospitality sector and our Craft Union business has worked closely for a
number of years with Only A Pavement Away to help find employment for the homeless, ex-offenders and
vulnerable veterans within the hospitality industry.

**_Recruitment_**

We strengthened our human resources team in 2012 with the establishment of an internal recruitment team and
the appointment of a success coach to promote the development of our top performing deputy managers. We view
our pool of managers as being crucial to our future success and place emphasis on the recruitment and retention
of highly skilled management. For risks related to our ability to identify and/or retain a talented pool of managers,
see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are dependent on key executives for our future success.”

**_Employment Legislation_**

Our site support management and hourly paid employees are subject to the Working Time Regulations, which
controls the hours they are legally allowed to work. In addition, as a large number of our staff is employed at the
National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, we are impacted by increases in the National Minimum
Wage and the National Living Wage. For risks related to employment regulations to which we are subject, see
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the
_introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business—_

_Employment regulations provide certain rights and protections to our employees, and changes to these_
_regulations may reduce our ability to operate our business efficiently.”_

**Intellectual Property**

As of April 7, 2024, we had 166 live trademarks, of which 68 are currently in use relating mostly to company
names, logos and brands. There are 98 trademarks that are no longer in use due to lack of relevance but are
nonetheless protected by us.

**Insurance**

The Group’s group-wide insurance coverage includes policies for risks associated with its business. These policies
provide insurance cover for material property damage, material accidents and material business interruption, in
addition to standard corporate insurance, including crime and directors and officers insurance.

We believe that our insurance coverage is sufficient for the risks associated with our operations and that our
policies are in accordance with customary industry practices. However, there can be no guarantee that the coverage
we maintain will be sufficient to cover the cost of defense or other damages in the event of a significant claim.
The nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims which may exceed the level of our insurance. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our insurance may be insufficient and certain types of loss may
_be uninsurable.”_

**Information Technology**

Our information technology team is based at its head office in Solihull. Our IT team supports the systems used
across our Managed and Operator-run Pubs as well as the reporting and analysis tool used by our regional
managers and senior management team.

The key system used at our Managed and Operator-run Pubs is the Aztec EPOS system, which is supported by
Zonal. This system records sales, stock and cash at our pubs. Fourth Hospitality’s Trade Simple program is used
to place stock orders, receive deliveries and feed stock information into the Aztec EPOS system, which in turn
produces the financial information that is used for our management and statutory reporting in our Managed Pubs.
We use a separate system for staff planning and payroll. This system is used for both salaried and weekly staff at
head offices and at our Managed pubs. The Aztec and Fourth Hospitality systems were designed for the pub and
hospitality industry, and we have been able to adapt them for Group purposes.

We have also implemented in all of our Managed pubs and Operator-run pubs ordering and payment apps, which
are either hospitality generic such as OrderPay or configured to our different brands and formats using Zonal’s
“white label” iOrder app platform such as MyPub, More, S&L and Be At One.

**Regulation**

Our operations are directly subject to, and indirectly affected by, extensive regulation, including in relation to pub
licensing, taxation, health and safety, sanitation, alcoholic drinks control and leisure (gaming) machines. Our
operations are also subject to regulation with regard to the environment, data protection, access for the disabled
and sales to younger customers (such as criminal prosecution for selling alcohol to minors under the age of 18
and allowing minors under the age of 16 to access pub premises without being accompanied by an adult). Some
of the regulations to which we are subject in England and Wales are discussed below. We are also subject to
regulations in Scotland such as the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. The regulatory framework in Scotland is
broadly consistent with that of England and Wales detailed below.

The responsibility to comply with these regulations is typically distributed based on operational control over the
relevant sites. Generally, we are responsible for regulatory compliance in respect of our Managed Pubs whereas
Pub Partners are responsible for regulatory compliance in respect of the pubs that they operate.

**_The Business and Planning Bill_**

In June 2020, The Business and Planning Bill was introduced in the UK parliament. The bill seeks to mitigate the
impact of COVID-19 in the hospitality sector by simplifying and reducing the process and costs of obtaining
outdoor licensing by pubs, bars, restaurants. In particular, the bill contains provisions allowing for a fast track
application process for pavement licenses to allow street furniture as well as permitting on–licensed premises to

127


-----

automatically be permitted to provide off-sales. It also relaxes certain conditions for premises which already have
off sales authorizations.

**_Licensing Regulation_**

Licensing authorities are responsible for the licensing system in England and Wales, which is governed by the
Licensing Act of 2003 (the “Licensing Act”). There is a two tier system for licensing: premises licenses and
personal licenses.

**_Premises Licenses_**

Premises licenses are held by the Group. The grant of a premises license permits the conduct of licensable
activities at any premises. Licensable activities relevant to our operations are:

  - the sale of alcohol;

  - the provision of regulated entertainment; and

  - the provision of late-night refreshment, including the provision of hot food and drink after 11:00 p.m.

There is no requirement to renew a premises license every year, but an annual fee is payable, and non-payment of
the annual fee can lead to suspension of a premises license. Premises licenses are subject to various mandatory
conditions, one of which is that there has to be a designated premises supervisor in respect of each premises
license. A designated premises supervisor must by law hold a personal license.

The licensing authorities, when making any decision under the Licensing Act, have to do so in accordance with
the four licensing objectives, being:

  - the prevention of crime and disorder;

  - public safety;

  - the prevention of public nuisance; and

  - the protection of children from harm.

The concept of fixed hours for the sale of alcohol was removed with the advent of the Licensing Act in November
2005, and all licensed premises now have flexibility (provided applicable licensing fees are paid) in terms of the
hours that alcohol can be sold and entertainment and/or late night refreshment provided. This flexibility is however
tempered by the fact that any decision to grant a license has to be determined by the licensing authority, having
regard to both the licensing objectives, its statement of licensing policy and UK Home Office guidance.

Each licensing authority produces its own statement of licensing policy, which must be revised at least every five
years. The UK Home Office has produced its own guidance on the interpretation of the Licensing Act, which
licensing authorities must have regard to when making any decisions.

**_Personal licenses_**

Each designated premises supervisor must, by law, hold a personal license. Individuals apply to a licensing
authority for a personal license where they habitually reside. A personal license is personal to the individual and
is portable. The UK government has dispensed with the requirement to renew a personal license every ten years.

**_The Pubs Code and Market Rent Only (MRO)_**

The Pubs Code, introduced by the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, came into effect on July
21, 2016 to regulate the relationship between tied pub tenants and the large pub-owning businesses, which rent
the pubs to tenants and sell them tied products.

The Pubs Code applies to all companies owning 500 or more pubs operating under tied leased and tenancy
agreements over five years in England and Wales, and is overseen and enforced by an independent Pubs Code
adjudicator. It provides tied publicans with a right, under certain circumstances, to replace their existing freelynegotiated tied agreements with the MRO arrangement. This enables tied tenants to opt out of the supply tie at
certain points or after certain exceptional events during the term of their lease agreements and to occupy the
premises on a standard commercial property lease, paying a market rent only. In the event that a tenant elects to
invoke this option, while income derived from the supply of tied drinks products would be partially offset by
increases in rent, it is possible that total income from that property would be adversely affected. The Pubs Code
was amended in March 2022 including changes to the MRO procedure concerning, among other things, the

128


-----

applicable timing requirements and the period a pub company must own 500 or more tied pubs in the previous
financial year in order to be subject to the Pubs Code (reduced from 6 months to 3 months). Accordingly, any
MRO event occurring after April 1, 2022 must follow the amended procedures. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to our Business—Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which_
_we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business.”_

As of April 7, 2024, the extent of conversions to commercial free-of-tie agreements has been lower than was
originally anticipated as there have been only limited numbers of publicans opting in for the MRO option. As of
April 7, 2024, 886 out of 4,414 sites of the Group, or 20%, operated on a tied lease, and 298 out of 4,414 sites of
the Group, or 6.8%, operated on a free-of-tie lease. From the date of the introduction of the Pubs Code in July
2016 to April 7, 2024, there have been 2,379 rent review or agreement renewal events across 1,691 pubs which
could potentially have triggered an MRO request. As required under the Pubs Code, we have accepted 674 notices
by tenants of which 341 have been concluded by way of mutually agreed tied deals and 181 have resulted in new
mutually agreed MRO terms. In addition, 91 tenants left the pub, 25 claims were withdrawn by the tenant or had
other outcomes with the balance of 36 pending. Of the outstanding 36, 4 have been referred to the Pubs Code
adjudicator for determination. Of the 1,691 pubs referred to above, 734 pubs were still operated by the same tenant
on either tied or free-of-tie agreements as of April 7, 2024.

Although we believe that the lower-than-expected number of MRO requests reflects the tenants’ recognition of
the benefits of their existing tied agreements compared to the MRO alternative, we have reduced the number of
longer-term leases and increased the proportion of shorter-term tenancy agreements of up to five years in length
to minimize any adverse impact of the Pubs Code on our business. Since the introduction of the MRO concept in
November 2014, we have reduced the number of agreements that would fall under MRO from 3,035 to 886 as of
April 7, 2024.

**_Other Food Hygiene and Health and Safety Regulations_**

Local authority environmental health departments police these areas of regulatory compliance through regular
inspections and reactive enforcement visits following accidents and incidents. They seek to ensure compliance
with the Food Safety Act of 1990 and Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974. The risk to the business is that it
could be required to close and/or that it could be prosecuted, with consequential fines.

Government proposals on sentencing guidelines became effective in February 2016, and these may be used
retrospectively by the courts. Should a company be found guilty of an offense under any relevant legislation,
including corporate manslaughter, the penalties imposed will be significantly higher than in the past, potentially
running into millions of pounds. We manage this risk by the implementation of robust systems of training and
record keeping, assisted by the use of professional consultants to ensure compliance.

In April 2018, the UK Government implemented the soft drinks industry levy as part of its initiative to combat
obesity, which was revised in April 2023 to broaden the range of relevant beverages subject to the levy. We
actively oversee the number of sugary products offered and incorporate healthier non-sugary alternatives to align
with the regulatory framework.

**_Gaming Regulation_**

The provision of machines in premises which have the benefit of a premises license is governed by the Gambling
Act of 2005. All premises which have a premises license permitting the sale of alcohol for consumption on the
premises, granted under the Licensing Act, and which contain a bar at which alcohol is served, can provide
machines available for public use.

**_Categories of Machines_**

All such premises are automatically entitled to provide one or two machines of Category C or D (described below).
To benefit from the use of these machines, the premises license holder must notify the licensing authority that it
wishes to avail itself of the benefit of up to two Category C or D machines, and pay a £50 fee. There is no annual
fee payable for this automatic entitlement, once the initial fee has been paid. If the premises wish to have more
than two machines of Category C or D, then it must make an application to the licensing authority for a licensed
premises gaming machine permit. Such applications may need to be determined by the licensing authority at a
hearing. Once granted, an annual fee is payable for such permits.

Category C machines have a maximum cash prize of £100, and a maximum stake of £1. Only persons aged 18 or
over are allowed to play on Category C machines. Category D machines have different maximum stakes and

129


-----

prizes, but where the prize is money (which is the usual case), the maximum stake is ten pence, with a maximum
prize of £5. Persons under the age of 18 are allowed to play on Category D machines. Commonly, it is Category
C machines which are found in licensed premises.

**_Smoking Regulation_**

There is a legal requirement under the Health Act 2006 for premises which are classed as “enclosed” to be smoke
free. The restrictions do not currently apply to electronic cigarettes which allow the user to inhale nicotine in vapor
form, and which do not then produce any smoke, but otherwise apply to anything that can be smoked.

**_Noise Nuisance Regulation_**

Local authority environmental health officers are empowered by the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 and
associated legislation to police the issue of noise nuisance arising from commercial premises. They have the power
to issue fixed penalty notices in certain circumstances and to issue noise abatement notices requiring the cessation
of the nuisance. Informal discussion normally precedes such formal action but not always. The onus is on the
business to demonstrate due diligence in the prevention of such nuisance.

**_Other Recent Regulations_**

On 6 April 2022, the UK Government introduced the Calorie Labelling (Out of Home sector) (England)
Regulations 2021 which required businesses with more than 250 employees to display calorie information on nonpackaged food and soft drink menus. These regulations and other future initiatives that result in a requirement for
restaurants, cafes and pubs to display nutritional information on their menus, including for alcoholic drinks and
other related requirements, could give rise to additional compliance costs for us in relation to our Managed and
Operator-run pubs.

On May 2, 2023, the UK Government published the draft Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill (“Martyn’s
Law”) which puts premises owners under a duty to consider the threat from terrorism and implement proportionate
mitigating measures. Among other categories, Martyn’s Law also applies to premises with a maximum capacity
of over 100 people, which are required to implement certain safety preparedness measures and policies, including
training, information sharing and completion of a preparedness plan to embed practices such as locking doors to
delay attackers progress or knowledge on lifesaving treatments that can be administered by staff whilst awaiting
emergency services. Martyn’s Law is expected to be adopted as law in the coming months.

**Environmental Matters**

As part of our corporate social responsibility program we have implemented a number of schemes on
environmental matters.

We collaborate with ERM International, a consultancy firm focused solely on sustainability, to perform scenario
analysis to identify potential climate-related risks and opportunities and understand how changes to the climate
and the transition to a low-carbon economy may impact our risk or opportunity profile.

We partner with Olleco in the recycling of our used cooking oil. Our used oil is refined into a range of products
such as industrial oils and renewable fuels. For the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, we collected 942,000
liters (or 865 metric tons) of used cooking oil, which is the equivalent of saving 2,008 metric tons of carbon. For
the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2022, we collected 835,000 liters (or 767 metric tons) of used cooking oil,
which is the equivalent of saving 2,777 metric tons of carbon.

We also work in partnership with Veolia Environmental Services for waste collection and recycling services.
Veolia provides four waste stream services covering general waste, mixed recycling, glass recycling and food
recycling, which assists us with reaching our zero waste to landfill target. As of September 24, 2023, 100% of our
waste is diverted from landfill and 66.6% is recycled. Therefore, as a result, we have been able to significantly
reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills. This is the equivalent of saving over 1.2 million kg of carbon
over the last 12 months. We use smart energy meters to monitor and manage energy usage, so to be as efficient as
possible to help reduce consumption.

Along with other key players in the hospitality industry, we are an active member of the Zero Carbon Forum, a
non-profit organization having the aim of sharing best practices on reducing energy consumption, as well as
defining and implementing a net zero strategy to drive sector-wide change.

130


-----

For Managed and Operator-run pubs, we operate through a self-sustained water supply and cooperate with service
providers such as Waterscan and other wholesalers to ensure that the water consumption is at the lowest level
possible.

We believe that we do not currently have any outstanding material environmental compliance costs or
environmental liabilities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We could be liable for
_environmental compliance costs at our properties.”_

**_Producer Compliance Schemes_**

We are an “obligated packaging producer” in respect of packaging waste under the Producer Responsibility
Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (the “2007 Regulations”). Producers of packaging must ensure
that a proportion of their products is recovered and recycled in accordance with EU requirements which have been
transposed into national legislation. We are registered as a packaging waste producer. Our Managed pubs have
the facilities to recycle 100% of the glass used in the business.

**_Trade Effluent Discharge Consents_**

Under the Water Industry Act 1991, a consent must be obtained (or an agreement entered into) with a local water
and sewerage company in order to discharge liquid effluent from trade or industrial premises into (a) a public foul
sewer; or (b) a private sewer that connects to a public foul sewer. We hold the necessary trade effluent discharge
consents for our head office and our Managed Pubs.

**_Asbestos_**

The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 impose a duty to manage Asbestos Containing Materials (“ACMs”)
in non-domestic property such as by taking reasonable steps to locate ACMs; checking their condition; assessing
the risk of exposure to such materials; taking any necessary action to address any such identified risks and
maintaining a register of ACMs. The primary duty to manage falls upon the person or organization that has the
responsibility for the repair and maintenance of the property.

Any non-compliance could lead to enforcement action against the organization in question and any responsible
individuals (including (unlimited) criminal fines and the potential for imprisonment of individuals), which are not
covered by way of an indemnity and/or insurance. Claims for personal injury caused as a result of exposure to
ACMs may also be brought by third parties. We have a planned maintenance visit in place for all sites containing
asbestos where we have a repairing liability. Each year the stability of the asbestos is assessed on site and, if
required, remedial action will be taken to either further encapsulate or remove any asbestos that has become
unstable. All contractors attending site for maintenance have access to our asbestos surveys and are required to
view these surveys as part of their risk assessment and have to act accordingly. In addition, prior to any major
investment we undertake a refurbishment and demolition asbestos survey that checks the area to be developed for
the presence of any asbestos.

**_Fire_**

Pursuant to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, as employers and/or persons in control of premises
(“responsible persons”) we have duties to take such fire precautions as are reasonably practicable to ensure the
safety of employees and third parties and to carry out a fire risk assessment. Conviction for a

breach of the 2005 Order may attract substantial fines and penalties. Our fire risk assessments are up to date and
regularly reviewed to ensure that all significant risks of potential fires are addressed and managed accordingly.

**_Legionella_**

We have a duty to manage the risk of exposure to legionella bacteria exposure under the Control of Substances
Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations and other health and safety legislation. Risk assessments that cover
L8 guidance are carried out on planned maintenance visits every two years.

**_Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (ESOS)_**

We are subject to the Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme Regulations 2014 and we are fully compliant with
reporting requirements under the Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”). We completed the ESOS survey
with Carbon Trust and logged compliance with the Environment Agency. In addition, we are planning for the

131


-----

upcoming ESOS Phase 3 compliance set for 2024. We have embraced this initiative and have taken learning from
all of the energy saving opportunities highlighted.

**_Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)_**

We are aware of our obligations under the Energy Efficiency (Private Rented Property) (England and Wales)
Regulations 2015 (the “Regulations”) which are designed to secure energy efficiency improvements to properties
in England and Wales with an energy performance rating presently of F or G on their Energy Performance
Certificate (“EPC”). We are aware that EPC standards are likely to increase in the future and are proactively
managing the future requirements of EPCs. Where low efficiencies are identified we are seeking to prioritize those
by investing in remedial works.

**_Litigation_**

We have been and, from time to time, may continue to become party to claims, proceedings and lawsuits incidental
to the ordinary course of our business.

established goals. This committee also serves as the final point of authorization for any proposed investment
capital expenditure programs.

**_Risk Management Committee_**

The Group’s risk management committee is chaired by its head of risk and is composed of representatives from
its property, food, operations, commercial and finance departments. The risk management committee meets every
three months and its principal role is to monitor the risks facing the industry and the business and to evaluate and
develop strategies to respond to, and mitigate, such risk. This committee also monitors and reports on latest
developments in regulation to which the Group’s business operations are subject.

**Conflicts of Interest**

We believe that there are currently no conflicts of interest between the duties owed by executive management to
us and their private interests. Certain of the directors are representatives of TDR Capital, which is our indirect
majority shareholder. In certain situations, the interests of TDR Capital, as indirect majority shareholder, may
differ from the interests of our other shareholders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure—The
_interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes.”_

**Compensation**

The aggregate compensation paid by the Group to its directors and key management personnel for the 52 weeks
ended September 24, 2023 was £5 million, comprising their aggregate salaries and short term benefits, postemployment pension benefits and redundancy payments made during this period.

The Group has established an incentive program for key employees to help meet its strategic objectives, reward
superior performance and encourage achievement of personal objectives. The program incentivizes such key
employees through an annual cash bonus program linked to the Group’s key financial performance measures.

**Management Incentive Program**

Pursuant to a management incentive program that was implemented in February 2013, certain members of the
Group’s senior management were issued Class B ordinary shares of Midco. Under this program, the Group
extended cash loans to certain members of its senior management in order for them to purchase these shares.

In February 2019, the Group implemented a management incentive program, under which certain existing and
new members of the Group’s management purchased Class B ordinary shares of Midco. This management
incentive program replaced the old one and has substantially similar terms and conditions. For example, in the
event of a transfer of all the shares of the Group, an initial public offering, an asset sale of all or substantially all
of the Group’s assets, or a liquidation, these managers will be entitled to receive proceeds based on their respective
holdings of ordinary B shares calculated based on the sale price. In addition, the new management incentive
program includes good and bad leaver provisions in the event that a manager leaves the Group. Depending on the
cause and time of leaving, managers may receive a payment between the fair market value of their investment and
the initial investment cost.

The Group has implemented a new management incentive program in connection with the Ei Acquisition. Under
this management incentive program, the Class B ordinary shares previously held by certain members of the
Group’s management in Midco have been exchanged for Class B ordinary shares of Stonegate Holdings, an
indirect parent company of Midco and the Parent. In addition, the managers have transferred the legal title to their
shares held in Stonegate Holdings to a nominee. The nominee holds the shares in Stonegate Holdings on trust for
the managers, who retain beneficial title to the shares. Further, the rights attaching to the shares held by managers
were enhanced, for which managers paid fair market value. In addition, certain select senior employees of Ei
Group, who continued their employment with the Group, subscribed for Class B ordinary shares as part of the
management incentive program.

The Group may change the terms and conditions of its management incentive program and may introduce
additional measures to incentivize its management going forward. From time to time, the Group may also include
new managers under its management incentive program.

**Share Ownership**

Certain members of our board of directors and the senior management of the Group have a beneficial ownership
interest in Stonegate Holdings. See “Principal Shareholders.”

(1) Entities owned by funds managed by our sponsor, TDR Capital, have entered into certain arrangements with AlbaCore, pursuant to
which it is expected that AlbaCore shall exchange its commitments as a lender under the Existing PIK Facility Agreement for a noncontrolling shareholding interest in Stonegate Holdings. Such non-controlling shareholding interest is expected to be by way of new
Class C Ordinary Shares in the share capital of Stonegate Holdings, with customary minority protection rights and the right to appoint
a director to Stonegate Holdings. The completion of this transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including an affiliate of the
sponsor funding a minimum cash amount of £200 million to provide additional funding and/or deleveraging to the Stonegate Group,
and it may or may not be completed as of the Issue Date. See “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure.”

(2) Pursuant to the new management incentive program, members of senior management have transferred the legal ownership of the Class
B ordinary shares held by them to a nominee and retain beneficial ownership of the shares. Further, under the new management incentive
program, beneficial ownership in additional Class B ordinary shares were also allocated to certain senior employees of Ei Group, who

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

We enter into transactions with our shareholders and other entities owned by, or affiliated with, our direct and
indirect shareholders in the ordinary course of business on fair terms and at arm’s length. These transactions
include, among other things, professional advisory, consulting and other corporate services. The following
discussion is a brief summary of certain material arrangements, agreements and transactions we have with related
parties.

**Certain Transactions with TDR Capital and Various Holding Companies**

For the 24 weeks ended April 7, 2024, we paid TDR Capital management services and monitoring fees in an
aggregate amount of £1 million. During a prior period, the Parent purchased inventory on behalf of TDR Capital
for TDR Capital’s use in the operation of certain public houses. As of April 7, 2024, the outstanding balance in
favor of the Parent was £0.02 million.

During the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2023, the Parent owed a loan of £7 million to Stonegate Pub Company
Holdings Limited, an indirect parent company of the Parent. The loan is repayable on demand and carries an
interest of SONIA plus 2.5%.

As of April 7, 2024, there was an outstanding amount owing to us from PIKCo in the amount of £8 million. As
of April 7, 2024, we owed Midco £2 million in relation to the purchase by our management of certain ordinary
shares of Midco, where management funded us, thereby creating a payable to Midco.

On June 13, 2022, the Parent provided a £4 million loan to Stonegate Pub Company Kitchens Limited, a company
under common control of the ultimate parent company, Stonegate Pub Company Topco Sarl, a company
incorporated in Luxembourg. The loan charges interest at a rate of 8.5% and expires in 2029. The amount owed
as of April 7, 2024 is £5 million.

**Shareholder Contribution**

On or prior to the Issue Date, we expect to receive shareholder contribution from entities owned by TDR Capital,
which we expect to utilize in connection with the Transactions, including the discharge of our liabilities in full
under the Existing Second Lien Facility. Such subordinated funding may be pursuant to an equity investment or
the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement. The Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement, if entered into, is
expected to provide for a PIK term loan facility and may be secured on the Collateral on a deeply subordinated
basis, ranking behind the Notes in right of payment.

**Platinum Transactions**

We transferred 1,034 Platinum Pubs on January 26, 2024 to the Platinum Group, which consists of certain wholly
owned subsidiaries of the Parent. As part of the Platinum Transactions, the Parent has also entered into certain
agreements with Platinum Group on an arm’s length basis to provide the Platinum Pubs portfolio with certain
services and procurement agreements. See “Summary—Platinum Transactions.”

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following is a summary of certain provisions of the financial arrangements to which the Parent and certain_
_of its subsidiaries are, or would be a party, following the completion of the Transactions. It does not purport to_
_be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

**Revolving Facilities Agreement**

**_Revolving Facilities_**

On or prior to the Issue Date (the “Effective Date”), certain amendments will be made to the Revolving Facilities
Agreement pursuant to the RCF Amendment Agreement, such that with effect from the Effective Date it will
provide for multicurrency credit facilities in an aggregate amount of £273,277,273 (of which (i) £25,000,000 will
be provided as a bilateral overdraft facility by Barclays Bank PLC, and (ii) £379,800 will be provided as a rent
guarantee by Barclays Bank PLC, in each case pursuant to the ancillary facility mechanic) (the “Revolving
**Facilities”). The Revolving Facilities may be drawn by way of cash advances or the issue of letters of credit or**
ancillary facilities. The Revolving Facilities may be used towards the general corporate purposes and/or the
working capital requirements of the Group (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) (including for any
acquisitions or capital expenditure).

In addition, the Parent may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional tranches of
the Revolving Facilities (the “Revolving Incremental Facilities”). The Parent and the lenders in respect of the
Revolving Incremental Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the Revolving Incremental Facilities,
including the margin and the termination date (subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving Facilities
Agreement). The indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Incremental Facilities must be otherwise permitted
under the Revolving Facilities Agreement.

**_Maturity and Availability Period_**

The Revolving Facilities will mature on January 31, 2029 (the “Maturity Date”).

The Revolving Facilities are available to be drawn from and including the Issue Date to and including one (1)
month prior to the Maturity Date.

**_Interest and fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Facilities Agreement initially bear interest at the aggregate of 3.00% per annum and
(in the case of loans in pound sterling) SONIA or (in the case of loans in euros) EURIBOR or (in the case of loans
in US dollars) SOFR, as applicable.

The margin for each loan under the Revolving Facilities Agreement is subject to adjustment by reference to the
consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as shown in the quarterly financial statements or, as the case may be,
the annual financial statements for that relevant period and the related compliance certificate, to equal the rate per
annum set out in the following table:


**(£ in millions)**


**Revolving Facilities**
**margin (% p.a.)**


Greater than 4.75:1.00 ................................................................................................................................................. 3.00

Equal to or less than 4.75:1.00 but greater than 4.25:1.00 ........................................................................................... 2.75

Equal to or less than 4.25:1.00 .................................................................................................................................... 2.50

Following an initial public offering ............................................................................................................................. 2.25

The margin on any loans under the Revolving Incremental Facilities will be agreed between the Parent and the
relevant lenders.

If SONIA, EURIBOR or SOFR (as applicable) and the applicable credit adjustment spread is less than zero,
SONIA, EURIBOR or SOFR (as applicable) and the applicable credit adjustment spread shall be deemed to be
zero in respect of any loan under the Revolving Facilities Agreement.

Commitment fees are payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Facilities for
the relevant periods set out in the Revolving Facilities Agreement at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin.
Generally, the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of availability of the Revolving

139


-----

Facilities and if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the Revolving
Facilities at the time such cancelation is effective.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on any overdue amount.

**_Repayment_**

All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facilities are required to be repaid on the relevant maturity date
referred to above.

Loans under the Revolving Facilities must be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject
to a netting mechanism against new loans under the Revolving Facilities to be drawn on such date.

The termination date in respect of a Revolving Incremental Facilities will be the date agreed between the Parent
and the relevant lenders.

**_Prepayment_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount and certain
conditions).

The Revolving Facilities Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all amounts
due to that lender upon a change of control of the Parent or a sale of the whole or substantially the whole of the
business and assets of the Stonegate Group.

**_Guarantees_**

The Revolving Facilities are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer.

The Revolving Facilities Agreement includes a “Guarantor Coverage Threshold” (being, subject to certain
exceptions, the requirement that the Consolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors represents not less than 80% of the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Stonegate Group and the aggregate of the total assets of the Guarantors represents
not less than 80% of the total assets of the Stonegate Group). If the Guarantor Coverage Threshold is not met
when tested by reference to delivery of the annual financial statements of the Parent for the relevant year, within
60 days each Material Company that is not already a guarantor (together with such other members of the Stonegate
Group as necessary) shall become guarantors under the Revolving Facilities Agreement in order to meet the
Guarantor Coverage Threshold at that time. “Material Company” is generally defined under the Revolving
Facilities Agreement to include, among other things, any member of the Stonegate Group that has earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing more than 5% of consolidated EBITDA of Stonegate
Group or has gross assets representing 5% or more of the gross assets of the Stonegate Group.

**_Security_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement is secured by the same security interests granted as security for the Notes.
See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.”

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties (subject to certain
exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being repeated), including (but not
limited to) status, binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, authorizations,
no default, governing law and enforcement, sanctions and anti-corruption laws.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related definitions (with
certain adjustments) that are included in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” In
addition, the Revolving Facilities Agreement contains a financial covenant (see “—Financial Covenant.”)

The Revolving Facilities Agreement also requires disposals of freehold and leasehold property owned by obligors
which are subject to transaction security (the “Properties”) to be subject to a loan to value financial covenant. No
disposals of Properties by an obligor to a non-obligor that will cause the market value of completed disposals of
Properties since the Effective Date to exceed in aggregate £500,000,000 (and any disposal thereafter) shall be

140


-----

permitted unless the loan to value (being the proportion of (i) the aggregate amount of available commitments and
loans under the Revolving Facilities to (ii) the aggregate market value of the Properties as set out in the most
recently available valuation of the Properties) is 25% or less, pro forma for such disposal.

The Revolving Facilities Agreement also contains a “notes purchase condition” covenant. Subject to certain
exceptions set out in the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Parent may not, and shall procure that no other
member of the Stonegate Group will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire the
principal amount of the Notes (but excluding any amount outstanding under any “finance document” entered into
in respect of the Revolving Facilities Agreement) prior to its scheduled repayment date in any manner which
involves the payment of cash consideration by a member of the Stonegate Group to a person which is not a member
of the Stonegate Group The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia, generally, payments that do not exceed
50% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Notes in existence as of the date of their issuance or incurred
at any time after their issuance.

The Revolving Facilities Agreement also requires certain members of the Stonegate Group to observe certain
affirmative covenants, including covenants relating to maintenance of Guarantor Coverage Threshold on an
annual basis (see “—Guarantees” above) and further assurance with respect to security interests granted.

Certain of the covenants under the Revolving Facilities Agreement will be suspended including upon the longterm corporate credit rating of the Parent (or any holding company of the Parent) being equal to or better than
Baa3 or BBB-, according to Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services,
respectively.

The Revolving Facilities Agreement also contains an “information covenant” under which, among other things,
the Parent is required to deliver to the Revolving Facilities Agent annual financial statements, quarterly financial
statements and compliance certificates. In addition, as part of the information covenant, the Revolving Facilities
Agreement requires the Parent to supply an annual budget.

**_Financial Covenant_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement requires that the consolidated leverage ratio in respect of each period of
twelve months ending on any quarter date (the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) shall not be greater than
9.00:1.00 provided that this financial covenant is only to be tested if on the last day of such period, the amount
drawn under the Revolving Facilities Agreement is greater than 40% of the total revolving facility commitments.

The Parent is permitted (subject to certain conditions) to prevent or cure breaches of the Consolidated Leverage
Ratio covenant by applying a “cure” amount (generally, amounts received by the Parent in cash pursuant to any
new equity or permitted subordinated debt) as if, at the election of the Parent, consolidated EBITDA of Stonegate
Group had been increased by such amount or consolidated leverage had been reduced by such amount. There is
no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Revolving Facilities. No more than four different
cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Facilities Agreement and
different cure amounts in consecutive financial quarters are not permitted.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement contains a limited number of events of default (misrepresentation,
unlawfulness, failure to comply with the financial covenant (subject to cure)), subject in certain cases to agreed
grace periods and other qualifications. Additionally, the Revolving Facilities Agreement mirrors the events of
default applicable to the Notes.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**Second Lien Facility Agreement**

On or before the Issue Date, we will enter into the Second Lien Facility Agreement among, among others, the
Parent, as parent, LTP1, as borrower, Barclays Bank PLC, as mandated lead arranger, and Barclays Bank PLC,
as agent and security agent. The Second Lien Facility Agreement provides for a term loan credit facility in the
amount of £156,250,000 (the “Second Lien Facility”), which it is intended will be drawn in full on the Issue Date
for the purpose of financing or refinancing the discharge of the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement and
transaction costs.

141

In addition, the Parent may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional tranches of
the Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Incremental Facilities”). The Parent and the lenders in respect of
the Second Lien Incremental Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the Second Lien Incremental
Facilities, including the margin and the termination date (subject to parameters as set out in the Second Lien
Facility Agreement). The indebtedness incurred under the Second Lien Incremental Facilities must be otherwise
permitted under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

Second Lien Facility Agreement. Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on any overdue
amount. LTP1 is also required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency fees in connection with the
Second Lien Facility.

offering (subject to certain consolidated senior secured leverage ratio thresholds), certain disposals (subject to
certain exceptions and reinvestment rights), certain issuances of common stock or equity interests (subject to
certain exceptions) and the borrowing of loan facilities or the issuance of any debt securities.

Subject to certain exceptions, if the Second Lien Facility is voluntarily prepaid (or mandatorily prepaid upon the
occurrence of the events specified above) LTP1 is required to pay (or procure that another member of the
Stonegate Group will pay) a prepayment fee as set out and calculated under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

**_Guarantees_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement is guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee the Revolving Facilities.
See “—Revolving Facilities Agreement—Guarantees” above.

The Second Lien Facility Agreement includes a “Guarantor Coverage Threshold” (being, subject to certain
exceptions, the requirement that the Consolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors represents not less than 80% of the

**Existing PIK Facility Agreement**

**_Existing PIK Facility_**

The Existing PIK Facility Agreement was entered originally into on July 17, 2019, and it provided for a PIK term
loan facility in the amount of £325,000,000 (the “Existing PIK Facility”) which was drawn in full by way of
cash advances in connection with the Ei Acquisition and related transactions. The Existing PIK Facility was used
for financing or refinancing, directly or indirectly, the cash consideration paid to fund the Ei Acquisition and
related transactions, including the discharge of the then existing Stonegate Group debt, the discharge of Ei Group
debt and transaction costs. Loans under the Existing PIK Facility are guaranteed by Stonegate Pub Company

guarantee liabilities in respect of such refinancing or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu
with any other liabilities and/or share pari passu in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities and/or

The creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor
Agreement (at the cost of the Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and
facilitating such financing, refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is not
prohibited by the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely manner. In
particular, each of the Secured Parties authorizes and directs each of its respective agents and the Security Agent
to execute any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt documents required by the Parent
to reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including as regards the ranking of any such
arrangements).

(a) are secured or expressed to be secured by any asset, including pursuant to any transaction security, on a
basis junior to any of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Liabilities but senior to the Second Lien
Liabilities (and for these purposes such liabilities will be treated as “senior” to the Second Lien Liabilities
if the Second Lien Liabilities are not secured by such asset but the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Liabilities are secured, and such other liabilities would be, secured by such asset);

(b) are expressed to rank or rank so that they are subordinated to any of the Super Senior Liabilities and the
Senior Liabilities but are senior to the Second Lien Liabilities; or

(c) are contractually subordinated in right of payment to any of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Liabilities and senior in right of payment to the Second Lien Liabilities, in each case, unless such ranking
or subordination arises as a matter of law and provided that this shall not restrict any Debtor or any other
member of the Group from incurring, if permitted under the debt documents relating to the Super Senior
Liabilities and/or the Senior Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and/or the Senior Liabilities which are
entitled to receive the proceeds of enforcement of the security on a super senior basis to the other Super

_Lenders_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that none of the Super Senior Secured Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors
or the Operating Facility Lenders may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after the
occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (an “Insolvency Event”) in relation to the Parent or a Debtor,
each Super Senior Secured Creditor, Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may, to the extent it is
able to do so under the relevant debt documents, take certain Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding up,
dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of the Parent or that Debtor (as applicable)
for liabilities owing to it (but a Super Senior Secured Creditor, Senior Creditor or an Operating Facility Lender
may not direct the Security Agent to enforce the common security in any manner).

_Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors_

Senior Notes Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (the “Senior
**Secured Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event which is continuing, by giving**
not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees), in
accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, of all, but not part, of the rights,
benefits and obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Operating Facility Documents;

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the
Operating Facility Documents are complied with, other than:

(i) any requirement to obtain the consent of, or consult with, a member of the Group in relation to
such transfer, which consent or consultation shall not be required; and

(ii) to the extent to which all the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors provide cash cover for any

(i) any amounts provided as cash cover by the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors for any letter of
credit (as envisaged in paragraph (b)(ii) above);

(ii) all of the Super Senior Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts that
would have been payable under the Revolving Facilities Agreement if the facility under the
Revolving Facilities Agreement were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that
payment; and

(iii) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Revolving Agent and/or the
Revolving Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(d) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(i) all of the Operating Facility Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts
that would have been payable under the Operating Facility Documents if the Operating Facilities
were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that payment; and

(ii) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Operating Facility Lenders and/or
the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(iii) as a result of that transfer:

(A) the Revolving Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a Debtor under
the Revolving Finance Documents; and

155


-----

(B) the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a Debtor
under the Operating Facility Documents;

(e) an indemnity is provided from each of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors (other than any Senior
Agent) or from another third-party acceptable to all the Revolving Lenders and the Operating Facility
Lenders in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Revolving Lender and Operating Facility Lender in
respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Revolving
Lender or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Revolving
Lender or Operating Facility Lender from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is
required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Revolving Lender or Operating Facility Lender
for any reason;

(f) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Revolving Lenders or
the Operating Facility Lenders, except that each Revolving Lender and Operating Facility Lender shall
be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power
to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it of that transfer;
and

(g) the Senior Parent Creditors have not exercised their rights to purchase as described under the provisions
set out in the caption “—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors” or, having exercised such rights,
have not failed to complete the acquisition of the relevant Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with
such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a transfer of the
Revolving Liabilities or the Operating Facility Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of Hedging
Liabilities in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of the Revolving Liabilities or the Operating Facility
Liabilities (as applicable) may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors), the Revolving Agent and
the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify that Senior Agent of the foregoing payable sums in connection with
such transfer.

**_Second Lien Payment Blockage Provisions_**

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Super Senior Consent) and the Senior

that no other member of the Group will make), and no Second Lien Secured Creditor may receive from any other

(b) a Material Event of Default is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which
the Revolving Agent and/or the Senior Agent delivers a payment stop notice (a “Second Lien Payment
**Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Material Event of Default to the**
Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor
Representative until the earliest of:

    - the date falling (a) 90 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice if a Second
Lien Event of Default is continuing in respect of non-payment of principal, interest or fees in

a Permitted Second Lien Financing Document; (c) 150 days after delivery of that Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice if any other Second Lien Event of Default is continuing;

that standstill period expires;

    - the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the applicable Revolving Finance Documents or Senior Debt Documents, as
applicable;

to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect
the right of the Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of
circumstances.

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Material Event of Default which had been
notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Second Lien Debt as a result of the issue of a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent
(i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in any Second Lien Debt Document) as a consequence of
that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Debt Document; (ii) the issue of a Second
Lien Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Creditors; (iii) any debt-forequity transaction in respect of Second Lien Liabilities; (iv) payment of advisory or professional fees in respect
of restructuring advice and/or valuations in respect of the Debtors provided to the Second Lien Secured Creditors

consents or waivers of, the Revolving Finance Documents and the Senior Debt Documents, as applicable.

**_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_**

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall
continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set out under each
section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Creditors and Second Lien Liabilities”
even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

**_Cure of Second Lien Payment Stop_**

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior
Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Super Senior Payment Default or Senior Payment Default
ceases to be continuing; and

(b) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have been Permitted
Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, a Super Senior Payment Default
or Senior Payment Default,

then any event or circumstance specified to be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing Agreements
(an “Event of Default”) (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which
may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any Second Lien Enforcement

160


-----

Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any
further action being required on the part of the Second Lien Secured Creditors or any other creditor or Operating
Facility Lender.

**_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_**

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as
required by an Instructing Group:

(a) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the
enforcement of any security; and

(b) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation
to the Second Lien Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement.”

of the Second Lien Secured Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under the Revolving Facilities Agreement

(or from another third party acceptable to all the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured
Creditors (as applicable)) in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Super Senior Secured Creditor or
each Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which
may be sustained or incurred by any Super Senior Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor (as
applicable) in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Super Senior Secured Creditor or
any Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is
required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Super Senior Secured Creditor or any Senior
Secured Creditor (as applicable) for any reason; and

(g) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Super Senior Secured
Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable), except that each Super Senior Secured Creditor
or each Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on
the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary
action to authorize the making by it of that transfer.

-----

(d) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second Lien Standstill Period.

existence of such Second Lien Event of Default.

**_Second Lien Standstill Period_**

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning

Enforcement Notice on each of the Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Second
Lien Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Primary Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take any
Enforcement Action in relation to a particular borrower or issuer of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Borrower/Issuer”) or any guarantor of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities (a “Senior
**Parent Guarantor”); provided, however, that if a Second Lien Standstill Period ends pursuant to this**
paragraph, the Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to
the relevant Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken
by the Primary Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) against such Second Lien
Borrower/Issuer or Second Lien Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or a particular
Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Second
Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other

Consent) and the Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Senior Consent) has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Debt Document at the final
stated maturity of the amounts outstanding under that Second Lien Debt Document (provided that (i)
unless the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise
agreed pursuant to a Required Super Senior Consent, a Required Senior Consent and the Parent, the final
stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after the date of first utilization
under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, (the “Second Lien Standstill Period”).

**_Subsequent Second Lien Default_**

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption “—
_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the end of_
any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period has begun
as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.

**_Enforcement on Behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_**

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing security created pursuant to any
security document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Second Lien
Secured Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted
_Second Lien Enforcement” above against that Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or that Second Lien Guarantor (or any_
subsidiary of them) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the
instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such
enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Senior Parent Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Super Senior Consent), the Senior Discharge
Date (except with the Required Senior Consent) and the Second Lien Discharge Date (except with the Required
Second Lien Consent), no Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall make (and the Parent shall procure that no other member
of the Group will make), and neither the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes, the
Security Agent or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may receive from any other members of the Group,
any Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other than roll-up or capitalization of any amount or certain amounts due
to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own account and subject to certain other exceptions) if:

(a) a Super Senior Payment Default, a Senior Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment Default is
continuing; or

(b) a Revolving Event of Default (other than a Super Senior Payment Default), a Senior Event of Default
(other than a Senior Payment Default) or a Second Lien Event of Default (other than a Second Lien
Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which the
Revolving Agent, any Senior Agent and/or any Second Lien Agent delivers a payment stop notice (a
“Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to that Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

    - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice;

    - in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Liabilities, if a Senior Parent Standstill Period is in
effect at any time after delivery of that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

    - the date on which the relevant Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of Default and/or
Second Lien Event of Default has been remedied or waived in accordance with the applicable
Revolving Facilities Agreement, Senior Debt Document or Second Lien Debt Document;

    - the date on which the Revolving Agent, Senior Agent or Second Lien Agent which delivered
the relevant Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice delivers a
notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the other Agents cancelling the Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice;

    - the Primary Discharge Date; and

    - the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement
against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative waive this requirement, (i)
a new Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until
360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/ Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be
delivered by the Revolving Agent, a Senior Agent or a Second Lien Agent in reliance on a Revolving Event of
Default, a Senior Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that
Revolving Agent, Senior Agent or Second Lien Agent received notice of that Revolving Event of Default, Senior
Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default.

The Revolving Agent, the Senior Agents and the Second Lien Agents may only serve one Super Senior/
Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances.
Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Revolving Agent, the Senior
Agents and/or the Second Lien Agents to issue a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

167


-----

No Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Revolving
Event of Default, Senior Event of Default or Second Lien Default which had been notified to the Agents at the
time at which an earlier Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Finance Documents and any Permitted Parent
Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default, a Senior Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Indenture or
any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents;
or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the liability to make
any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Parent Finance
Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the provisions set out under each
section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities”
even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Finance Document and
any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Super Senior/
Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice
or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default, that Super
Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the
case may be) the Super Senior Payment Default or Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Parent
Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any Senior Parent Finance
Document or any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which would have been Permitted Senior
Parent Payments but for that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice, a
Super Senior Payment Default or Senior Payment Default, then any event or circumstance specified to
be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing Agreements (an “Event of Default”) (including
any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which may have occurred as a
result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which
may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further
action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the Senior Parent Debt Issuer and the
Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or the Permitted Parent
Financing Documents in accordance with their terms at any time (and subject only to any consent required under
them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the Primary Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(a) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the enforcement
of any security; and

(b) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the
guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer under the
Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

168


-----

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the_
extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

**_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_**

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Parent Agents (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors)
may, after a Revolving Acceleration Event, a Senior Acceleration Event or a Second Lien Acceleration Event, by
giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors of
all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities, the Senior Liabilities,
the Second Lien Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Revolving Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Revolving Liabilities), the relevant Senior Debt
Documents (in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Second Lien Debt Documents (in the case
of the Second Lien Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents (in the case of the Operating
Facility Liabilities) (as applicable);

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Revolving Facilities Agreement (in the case of
the Revolving Liabilities), the relevant Senior Debt Documents (in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the
relevant Second Lien Debt Documents (in the case of the Second Lien Liabilities) and/or any Operating
Facility Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in each case,
other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) each of the Revolving Agent (on behalf of the Revolving Lenders), the relevant Senior Agent (on behalf
of the relevant Senior Term Lenders, the Senior Bridge Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors and the
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors), is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(e) the relevant Second Lien Agent (on behalf of the relevant Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors, as applicable) is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(f) as a result of that transfer the Revolving Lenders, the Senior Term Lenders, the Senior Bridge Lenders,
the Second Lien Facility Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors,
the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual
or contingent liability to the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(g) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior Parent Agent) (or from
another third party acceptable to the relevant creditors) in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior
Secured Creditor in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or
incurred by any Revolving Lender, Senior Term Lender, Senior Bridge Lender, Second Lien Facility
Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any such
party from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed
back from any Revolving Lender, Senior Term Lender, Senior Bridge Lender, Second Lien Facility
Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender for any reason; and

(h) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, any Revolving Lender,
Senior Term Lender, Senior Bridge Lender, Second Lien Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor,
Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender, except that each of them shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that
transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to
authorize the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors) may
only require a Super Senior Liabilities Transfer and a Senior Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require
a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer
cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no Super Senior Liabilities Transfer or Senior
Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

169


-----

At the request of a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the relevant Senior Agent,
the Second Lien Agent and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Senior Parent Agents of the foregoing
payable sums in connection with such transfer.

**_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_**

The restrictions set out in the caption “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” above will not
apply if:

(a) a Senior Parent Event of Default (the “Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;

(b) the Revolving Agent and each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default
specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the Senior
Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be;

(c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(d) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period.

Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior Parent Enforcement Notice”) in
writing notify the Revolving Agent and each Senior Agent of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default.

**_Senior Parent Standstill Period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning
on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior
Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, serves a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the
Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and ending on the
earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Primary Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular guarantor of
the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior Parent Guarantor”);
_provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior_
Parent Finance Parties may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent
Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Primary Secured Parties against such Senior Parent
Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a particular Senior
Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Senior
Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other
permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each of the Revolving Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Super Senior
Consent), the Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Senior Consent) and any Second Lien Agent
(acting pursuant to a Required Second Lien Consent) has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding under
the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be (provided that (i)
unless the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required Super
Senior Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the
date falling 85 months after the after the date of first utilization under the Revolving Facilities Agreement,
(ii) unless the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required Senior
Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date
falling 85 months after the after the date of first utilization of any indebtedness under the Senior Debt
Documents, and (iii) unless the Second Lien Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant
to a Required Second Lien Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on

170


-----

a date prior to the date falling 97 months after the date of first utilization of any indebtedness under the
Second Lien Debt Documents),

(the “Senor Parent Standstill Period”).

**_Subsequent Senior Parent Notes Default_**

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption “—
_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default even if, at the end of_
any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Parent Standstill Period has begun
as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.

**_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_**

If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor
Representative (collectively, the “Senior Parent Agents” and each, a “Senior Parent Agent”) that it is enforcing
security created pursuant to any security document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent
Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” above against that Senior Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that_
security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely
to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group, any
party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in respect of liabilities owed
to that party shall (in the case of any creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution
would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—
_Turnover by the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent_
acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other
relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for
the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the
liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply
distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged by way of
set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the
Group, any creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited from that set-off shall (in the case of any
creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that the relevant discharge constitutes a receipt or recovery
of a type subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Turnover by the Creditors” and, in all cases, if
prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group),
subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and subject
to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds,” if the Security Agent or any other
Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities
will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually
applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an acceleration event which
is continuing, any member of the Group, each creditor and each Operating Facility Lender irrevocably authorizes
the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against that
member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

171


-----

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary
to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably requests in
order to give effect to the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and
(ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor or an Operating Facility Lender_
take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a
power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require, although a
Senior Notes Trustee, a Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee and the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall be under
no obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover by the Creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if at any time prior to the Final Discharge
Date, any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender receives or recovers from any member of the Group:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, (i) any of the liabilities which is
prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, or (ii) following the occurrence of the relevant
distress event which is continuing, any Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities
or Operating Facility Liabilities;

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing
_of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not_
give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) any amount:

Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed

173


-----

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than any Senior Notes Trustee, Permitted
Second Lien Notes Trustee or Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender agrees with the
Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial
or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings
relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security

Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing
Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other creditor or Operating Facility
Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce,
discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor or
Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the security be
enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from
any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest, which is capable
of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent, then that Creditor
or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing
Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent
shall be construed as references to that creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the
event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the Primary Discharge
Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior Parent Creditors in
respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of
any of that security shall be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or
delegate to the Debtors under general law.

_Consultation Period_

(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other Enforcement Action, the
creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing Group concerned
(and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each other creditor
representative of the Creditors of the Instructing Group, each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating
Facility Lender and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing
Group for a period of not less than 10 business days (or, in the case of any consultation involving a Senior
Notes Trustee, a Senior Parent Notes Trustee or a creditor representative in respect of any high-yield
notes, debt securities or other similar instruments, 30 days) from the date on which details of the proposed
instructions are received by such creditor representative(s), Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility
Lenders and the Security Agent (or such shorter period as each creditor representative, Hedge
Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation
**Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled**
to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing
the security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event conflicting instructions are received from any other
Instructing Group, the Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the
security or, as the case may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the
instructions given by an Instructing Group referred to in paragraph (a)(i)(A) of the definition of
Instructing Group as set out above (in each case, provided that such instructions are consistent with any

174


-----

applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents) and the terms of all
instructions given by any other Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.

(c) Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if:

(i) the Super Senior Secured Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of
the first Consultation Period;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu
thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the first Consultation
Period; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement
of the security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action at that time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case
provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the relevant security documents).

(d) Subject to paragraph (c) above, no Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in accordance
with paragraph (a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation
Period (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the creditors represented in the
Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor representative, the
Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby
delay the commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security, and, where this paragraph
(d) applies:

(I) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the
interests of the Super Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors (as
applicable) on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in
relation to the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

(II) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(a) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term
Facilities Agreement, the Senior Bridge Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any Permitted
Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member
of the Group, but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt
Financing Agreement to provide replacement security); or

175


-----

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement pursuant to
which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(b) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or agreement in
order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that document or
agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action in relation to
that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing
Agreement);

(c) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member of the
Group which has ceased to be a Debtor or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with such release;
and

(d) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the extent that
such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor),
or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be a
member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the resignation of that Debtor or the Debtor being
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall
(at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that
Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and the
respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the security and the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the Parent shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(a) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal or other
action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(b) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in accordance
with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements;

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt
Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the need for
any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other
Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into such documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent
(acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter described in the paragraph above.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Revolving Finance Documents or the Senior Debt
Documents to apply the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other
discharge or reduction of any Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Liabilities (as applicable) then no such application
of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Notes
Finance Documents or Permitted Parent Financing Documents and any such application shall discharge in full
any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any
Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply
any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction
of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at the cost of
the Parent):

(a) release the security; and

(b) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities, undertakings
and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being effected
at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become enforceable in
accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by enforcement of a security
interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third-party
subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor):

(a) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any
release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge
or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release:

(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets
or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor representatives;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to
release:

(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company
over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor representatives;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose
of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or
any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as
a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or
Debtor liabilities; provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the
Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of:

177


-----

(A) all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders; and

(B) all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intragroup liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group
liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors
to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all
or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities
on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted secured assets) as if those
proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent that any disposal
of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the
prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in relation to a member of the Group
would otherwise be released pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case
may be, other liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to
the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to
execute such documents as are required to so transfer those liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the request
of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of each Senior
Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such
disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a “public auction”
in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or, in circumstances where the Security Agent
(acting in good faith) considers that a public auction is not reasonably practicable taking into account all relevant
circumstances or following an attempted public auction the Primary Creditors (other than the Second Lien Secured
Creditors and the Senior Parent Creditors) make the highest final binding offer of all the offers received but that
offer is less than the aggregate par value of the Primary Liabilities (other than the Second Lien Liabilities and the
Senior Parent Liabilities), an independent financial adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account
all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial
adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the
Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

178

Lien Liabilities will be release or disposed of or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be released,

prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Senior Parent Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the
guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any security
over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior
Parent Notes Liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will be released or disposed of, it is a
further condition to the release that either:

- the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative has approved the release;

**_Liabilities of the Senior Parent Debt Issuer_**

Generally, all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent from or in respect of the
Senior Parent Debt Issuer pursuant to the terms of any debt document (other than in connection with the realization
or enforcement of all or any part of the relevant security interests) shall be held by the Security Agent on trust to

in the following order of priority:

(a) in accordance with paragraph (a) under the caption “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application;”

(b) in accordance with paragraph (b) under the caption “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application;”

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that:

(a) if, for any reason, any senior secured creditor liabilities, Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the resulting losses are not
borne by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the proportions
which their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the
relevant Senior Secured Creditors at the relevant enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting
from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security interests or a transaction in lieu
thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned “—Application
_of Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant Senior Secured Creditors will make such payments_
among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant Senior Secured Creditors in
such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions
(or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned
“—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”);

(b) if, for any reason, any Second Lien Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Permitted Second Lien

realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security interests or a transaction in lieu thereof, in a
manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned “—Application of
_Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Permitted Second_
Lien Financing Creditors will make such payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall require
to put the relevant Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors in
such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions
(or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned
“—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”); and

(c) if, for any reason, any Super Senior Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities remain unpaid after the
relevant enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne by the relevant Super Senior Secured

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security document may be

Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Second Lien Secured Creditors) or, in respect of any
Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt constituted by notes that have been issued, the Permitted Second
Lien Notes Trustee in respect thereof;

(d) if any Senior Parent Notes have been issued and the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of
the relevant Senior Parent Notes Indenture, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee;

(f) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a Hedging Agreement, that Hedge
Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver adversely affects the
continuing rights and/or obligations of that Hedge Counterparty and is an amendment or waiver which
is expressed to require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty under the applicable Hedging Agreement,
as notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(g) if an Operating Facility Lender is providing one or more facility to a Debtor under an Operating Facility
Document, that Operating Facility Lender (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment
or waiver adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that Operating Facility Lender and
is an amendment or waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Operating Facility Lender
under the applicable Operating Facility Document, as notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the
time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(h) certain investors as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(i) the Parent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment or waiver of any Secured Debt Document that is made or effected
in connection with any Debt Refinancing (see “—Debt Refinancing” above), any incurrence of additional and/or
refinancing debt (as referred to in “—Ranking and Priority—Additional and/or Refinancing Debt” above) or “nonDistressed Disposal” (see “—Proceeds of Disposals—Non-Distressed Disposals”) or any other provision of the
Intercreditor Agreement or in connection with any other provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided that
such amendment or waiver is not expressly prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt Document) shall
be binding on all parties to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Parent and the Security Agent without
the consent of any other party, to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or reflect
changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature, or as otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured
Parties.

184


-----

Any amendment, waiver or consent which relates only to the rights or obligations applicable to creditors under a
particular Debt Financing Agreement (and which does not materially and adversely affect the rights or interests
of creditors under other Debt Financing Agreements) may be approved with only the consent of the creditor
representative in respect of that Debt Financing Agreement and the Parent.

**_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_**

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and unless the
provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorized by an
Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions,” any amendment or waiver of,
or consent under, any security document which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged property
or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed requires approval as set out
under the section captioned “—Required Consents.”

**_Guarantees_**

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties and Operating Facility Lenders (each
as defined above) to receive guarantees and indemnities from the Debtors on substantially the same terms
(including the relevant limitations) as such guarantees and indemnities are provided by the obligors to the finance
parties under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the following paragraphs of this “—Exceptions” section, an amendment, waiver or consent which
adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent (in each case
in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, that arranger or the Security Agent (as the
case may be) at such time.

The foregoing shall not apply:

- to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

- to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—Proceeds
_of Disposals” above._

The first paragraph of this “—Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the extent that the arranger
liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything
in the debt documents to the contrary.

**The Unique Securitized Notes and the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement**

Ei is the holding company of Unique Pubs Limited (“UPL” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Unique
**Group”). Companies in the Unique Group are party to a securitization transaction (the “Unique Securitization”)**
pursuant to which The Unique Pub Finance Company plc (the “Unique Issuer”), a financing subsidiary within
the Unique Group, has raised debt through the issuance of various tranches of notes secured on, among other
things, a portfolio of pub properties (the “Unique Estate”), the beneficial title to which is held by Unique Pub
Properties Limited (“UPP”), another subsidiary within the Unique Group.

UPP and the Unique Issuer are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Unique Pub Investments Limited (“UPI”). Pursuant
to a deed poll dated March 30, 1999, UPI has represented that it is the sole beneficial (and, in the case of UPP, the
sole legal) owner of the shares in UPP and the Unique Issuer and has covenanted, among other things, not to
dispose of any of its assets including its shares and that it will not have any subsidiaries other than UPP and the
Unique Issuer.

185


-----

As of April 7, 2024, the following notes (together, the “Unique Securitized Notes”) issued by the Unique Issuer
were outstanding:

- £152 million Class A4 5.659% Notes due over a period to June 2027 (the “Class A Unique Notes”),
which are expected to be redeemed in entirety following the completion of the Transactions;

- £190 million Class N 6.464% Notes due over a period from September 2027 to March 2032 (the “Class
**N Unique Notes”).**

The following diagram sets out a simplified corporate structure and the principal arrangements in relation to the
Unique Securitized Notes:

(1) The Unique Pub Finance Company plc, an indirect subsidiary of Ei, is the issuer of the Unique Securitized Notes. The Law Debenture
Trust Corporation plc is the trustee in respect of the Unique Securitized Notes (the “Unique Trustee”).

(2) The net proceeds of each tranche of the Unique Securitized Notes have been applied by the Unique Issuer in making term advances to
UPP pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement (as defined below), and each such tranche under the Unique Intercompany
Loan Agreement amortizes at the same rate as the related class of Unique Securitized Notes. UPP pays to the Unique Issuer amounts
equal to all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Unique Issuer in connection with the Unique Securitized Notes.

(3) As security for its obligations in respect of the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, UPP has granted first-ranking security interests
in favor of the Unique Trustee over all of its assets and undertakings, including the Unique Estate and all rental income, income generated
from the supply of beer and non-beer products to tenants, etc. As security for its obligations in respect of the Unique Securitized Notes,
the Unique Issuer has granted security over, among other things, its right, title, interest and benefit in respect of the Unique Intercompany
Loan Agreement and the other relevant transaction documentation.

(4) Under the Beer Supply Agreement (as defined below): (i) Ei, as the Supply Manager (as defined below), supplies products to UPP’s
tenants subject to a tie and (ii) the Supply Manager pays UPP a monthly gross procurement fee in respect of the amount of products
delivered to the tenants.

(5) Under the Asset Management Agreement, Ei acts as the Asset Manager, managing and administrating the Unique Estate (the beneficial
ownership of which is held by UPP) for a monthly fee. The asset management responsibilities of the Asset Manager include, among
other things, the letting of pub properties to prospective tenants, organizing the making of repairs and the carrying out of maintenance
to the pubs and the taking of enforcement action against tenants in arrears pursuant to their leases.

(6) The rents received under the leases of the Unique Estate, the gross procurement fee received from Ei as Supply Manager, the income
derived from the supply to tenants of products (both subject to the tie and otherwise), the income from amusements with prizes machines
and ancillary machine income and any other miscellaneous income from the Unique Estate are used, among other things, to service and
repay the loans to the Unique Issuer under the Unique Intercompany Loan.

(7) Under the Cash Management Agreement (as defined below), Ei provides cash management functions for UPP (including in relation to
repayment of the loans pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement and the collection of rents, product supply income and
other income from the tenants) and the Unique Issuer.

The net proceeds of each tranche of the Unique Securitized Notes were applied by the Unique Issuer in making
term advances to UPP pursuant to an intercompany loan agreement (the “Unique Intercompany Loan
**Agreement”), the latest iteration of which is dated February 25, 2005 and as most recently amended on July 16,**
2020. Each of the tranches advanced pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement relates to a class of

186


-----

the Unique Securitized Notes and such tranche amortizes at the same rate as the related class of Unique Securitized
Notes. In addition, UPP pays to the Unique Issuer amounts equal to all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Unique Issuer in connection with the Unique Securitized Notes.

The Class N Unique Notes are subject to mandatory redemption in part on the interest payment dates falling from
September 2027 to March 2032 (inclusive). Assuming that no pub disposals or prepayments or purchases and
cancellations of Unique Securitized Notes occur, the Unique Issuer is expected to make the following repayments
of principal in respect of Class N Unique Notes:

  - From (but excluding) September 2026 to (and including) September 2027, £8.7 million in respect of the
Class N Unique Notes;

  - From (but excluding) September 2027 to (and including) September 2028, £40.3 million in respect of
the Class N Unique Notes; and

  - From (but excluding) September 2028 to (and including) September 2029, £40.3 million in respect of
the Class N Unique Notes.

Interest is payable in respect of the Unique Securitized Notes quarterly in arrears at a rate of 5.659% per annum
in respect of the Class A Unique Notes, and 6.464% per annum in respect of the Class N Unique Notes.

**_Security_**

As security for, among other things, its obligations pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, UPP
has granted first-ranking security interests in favor of the Unique Trustee over all of its assets and undertakings,
including the Unique Estate and all rental income, income generated from the supply of beer and non-beer products
to tenants, etc. As security for, among other things, its obligations in respect of the Unique Securitized Notes, the
Unique Issuer has granted security over, among other things, its right, title, interest and benefit in respect of the
Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement and the other relevant transaction documentation.

**_UPP’s Business_**

UPP is the owner of the Unique Estate. UPP receives rent from the tenants of the properties comprising the Unique
Estate, gross procurement fees from Ei as supply manager (see “—Supply Arrangements”) and other payments
arising in respect of its ownership of the Unique Estate.

Under the terms of the leases of approximately 70.0% of the pubs comprising the Unique Estate as of March, 30,
2024, the tenants who occupy such pubs are subject to contractual “tie” arrangements requiring those tenants to
purchase from UPP (or its nominee) specified beers, ciders, flavored alcoholic beverages, wines, spirits and
minerals (as set out in each tie). In addition, the ties prohibit such tenants from selling or exhibiting for sale any
products subject to the tie that are not supplied by UPP (or its nominee). The other pubs comprising the Unique
Estate are not subject to such contractual tie arrangements.

The rents received under the leases of the Unique Estate, the income derived from the supply to tenants of products
(both subject to the tie and otherwise), the income from amusements with prizes machines and ancillary machine
income and any other miscellaneous income from the Unique Estate are used, among other things, to service and
repay the loans to the Unique Issuer under the Unique Intercompany Loan.

The Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement restricts the ability of UPP to engage in certain activities and contains
provisions relating to, among other things, permitted acquisitions, permitted developments, permitted transactions,
capital expenditure and permitted disposals, as more fully described in the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement.

**_Supply Arrangements_**

Pursuant to a beer supply agreement (the “Beer Supply Agreement”) dated February 25, 2005 between, among
others, Ei (in such capacity, the “Supply Manager”) and UPP, UPP agreed to nominate or procure the nomination
of the Supply Manager as the supplier of products to tenants subject to a tie. The Supply Manager has agreed to
use reasonable endeavors to supply products to tenants under the terms of the Beer Supply Agreement. In
consideration of these nominations, the Supply Manager pays a monthly gross procurement fee to UPP in respect
of the amount of products delivered to the tenant, lessee or manager (as the case may be) during the preceding
period of four weeks in each 52-week cycle.

187


-----

The gross procurement fee is equal to the volume of products supplied by or on behalf of the Supply Manager in
the relevant period, multiplied by the then applicable relevant gross procurement fee figure in respect of such
product. The gross procurement fee figure for each relevant period for beer and cider includes an amount (the
“Product Accrual”) per unit accrued by UPP for each relevant period. The Product Accrual is equal to the relevant
then applicable Product Accrual figure multiplied by the volume of the relevant product supply by or on behalf of
the Supply Manager to tenants of the tied pubs. UPP uses the Product Accruals to make an annual payment to the
Supply Manager. Not later than November 30 each year, UPP pays to the Supply Manager the lesser of (a) the
total amount of Product Accruals paid by the Supply Manager to UPP in the preceding financial year and (b) the
aggregate amount paid by the Supply Manager to tenants who receive volume related discounts in that financial
year.

The gross procurement fee and Product Accrual figures may be varied in line with the retail price index annually.
In addition, if the Supply Manager can show that it would make a loss if it supplied products at the revised prices,
a lower gross procurement fee and Product Accrual can be agreed between UPP and the Supply Manager, with
the consent of the Unique Trustee.

The Supply Manager purchases products at a price which represents a discount per relevant unit of product to the
national wholesale list price per relevant unit of such product. Products supplied to tenants between the first and
15th of a month (both days inclusive) is typically due for payment on the first day of the following month. Products
supplied between the 16th and the last day of a month (both inclusive) are typically due for payment on the 15th
day of the following month. All such payments are made into collection accounts and held on trust for the Supply
Manager.

**_Management of the Unique Estate_**

Pursuant to an asset management agreement dated February 25, 2005 (the “Asset Management Agreement”), as
most recently amended on March 24, 2016, between, among others, Ei and UPP, Ei (in such capacity, the “Asset
**Manager”) has agreed to act as property and estate manager for UPP to be responsible for management and**
administration of the Unique Estate in return for a monthly fee. The fee for a month comprises one twelfth of the
relevant annual “Expense Amount” for each pub in the Unique Estate on the first day of the month plus estate
expenses in respect of that month (and any estate expenses previously incurred and not previously reimbursed).
These estate expenses include various amounts paid or incurred by the Asset Manager in respect of the Unique
Estate that are not paid or reimbursed by a tenant of the relevant pubs, including rents or other sums payable under
headleases, insurance premiums, payments under maintenance contracts and maintenance and repair costs. The
Expense Amount was £5,910 per pub as of February 2005 and is adjusted annually on October 1 in line with the
retail price index. On October 1, 2023, the Expense Amount per pub was revised to £11,800.

Additionally, if the Asset Manager believes that the fees payable to it during the next 12 months will result in the
Asset Manager making a loss in respect of the asset management services it provides, it may notify UPP of the
fact not later than two weeks prior to the loan payment date falling at the end of September in any year and it is
entitled to provide UPP with a proposal for an alternative fee rate which would result in the Asset Manager making
a gross profit in respect of the services it expects to provide. Any agreement between them that results in an
increased management fee requires the consent of the Unique Trustee. If UPP and the Asset Manager are unable
to agree an alternative management fee, either of them may refer the matter to an expert. The Asset Manager has
never exercised its rights described in this paragraph.

The asset management responsibilities of the Asset Manager include, among other things, the letting of pub
properties to prospective tenants, organizing the making of repairs and the carrying out of maintenance to the pubs
and the taking of enforcement action against tenants in arrears pursuant to their leases. In addition, in accordance
with the Asset Management Agreement, leases granted on or after March 24, 2016 to the Asset Manager or any
affiliate or employee of the Asset Manager (the “Asset Manager Affiliate”), which from the date of completion
of Ei Group’s acquisition by Stonegate Group, includes Stonegate Group companies, need to comply with certain
conditions specified in the Asset Management Agreement (including, in particular, with regard to certain
minimum rent requirements).

Pursuant to a cash management agreement dated February 25, 2005, as amended pursuant to an amendment
agreement dated June 30, 2021 (the “Cash Management Agreement”) between, among others, Ei and UPP, Ei
(in such capacity, the “Cash Manager”) has agreed to carry out certain cash management functions for UPP
(including in relation to repayment of the loans pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement and the
collection of rents, product supply income and other income from the tenants) and the Unique Issuer.

188


-----

**_Unique Accounts_**

UPP holds various bank accounts which include an account (the “Reserve Account”) from which withdrawals
may only be made with the prior written consent of the Unique Trustee in limited circumstances, and a transaction
account in which rents and beer and non-beer income payments are transferred after collection in certain collection
accounts (the “Transaction Account”).

Money held to the credit of the Transaction Account is, following payment of or provision for certain third party
expenses (including amounts payable to the Unique Issuer and to the Asset Manager, Cash Manager and Supply
Manager), required to be allocated to the Reserve Account until a debt service cover ratio test is met, namely that
(a) the Reserve Fund (being the balance standing to the credit of the Reserve Account, excluding Product Accrual)
is not less than the “Required Amount,” being £65,000,000, or, if there are no Class A Unique Notes outstanding,
the lower of £65,000,000 and the Target Amount, being an amount calculated by reference to the balance of the
Reserve Account and reducing in accordance with repayments of principal in respect of the Class N tranche
pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement), and (b) the debt service cover ratio requires that the ratio
of Cashflow to Debt Service (the “DSCR”) of UPP is at least 1.5:1 (the “DSCR Test”).

**_Certain Financial Covenants_**

Pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, UPP is required to conduct its operations and business
subject to two financial covenants: a net worth covenant and a debt service cover ratio covenant.

The net worth covenant requires that Net Worth (as defined below) that is tested annually by reference to the
unaudited management accounts of UPP not at any time be less than £300,000,000. For these purposes, “Net
Worth” is:

- the sum of the carrying value of UPP’s fixed and current assets minus the book value of its liabilities;
any accumulated after tax earnings (minus any accumulated losses) minus accumulated dividends paid
by UPP to UPI; any fully subordinated financial indebtedness of UPP; the amount of any value
adjustments or other non-cash provisions referable to the purchases of the Unique Estate by UPP; any
amount (on an after tax basis) attributable to the amortization or the writing off of costs associated with
the purchase of the Unique Estate by UPP; less

- the amount of any sums required by accounting principles generally accepted in the UK to be provided
for taxation payable by UPP in the accounts of UPP and not provided for in such accounts of UPP
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts relating to unprovided deferred taxation on the
revaluation of fixed assets.

The debt service cover ratio requires that the DSCR tested quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis will not be less
than 1.1:1. For these purposes:

- “Cashflow” is the unconsolidated earnings of UPP for the relevant period (a) before (or, if already taken
into account, adding back in) certain items including provision on account of taxation, interest and other
amounts incurred by UPP in respect of indebtedness, amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets
and any deduction for depreciation, amortization or writing off of costs associated with the purchase of
the Unique pub estate and fair value adjustments and other non-cash provisions and (b) after adjusting to
exclude certain items including any losses or gains arising from a sale of any pub, certain items treated
as extraordinary or non-operating exceptional income or charges, amounts attributable to the writing up
or down of UPP assets as a result of a revaluation and, to the extent not already taken into account in
calculating the net income of UPP, the sum of (i) £5,000 multiplied by the average number of pubs let
on variable term agreement leases during the relevant period and (ii) 8,400 multiplied by the number of
pubs let on ‘TMA Leases’ (as described in the operative documents governing the Unique Securitization)
during the relevant period (although, at present there are no TMA Leases in place);

- “Debt Service” means, in respect of any relevant period, the aggregate of (a) the difference between the
amount outstanding under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement at the beginning of the relevant
period and the amount scheduled to be outstanding at the beginning of the following period and (b) all
interest payable in respect of the period under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement after adjusting
for any amounts receivable or payable as a result of the operation of any hedging agreements (i) due to
be paid in respect of the period and (ii) unpaid at the beginning of the period in respect of previous
periods.

As of March 31, 2024, the Adjusted DSCR was 1.85 and the Net Worth was £1,441 million.

**_Further Issuances_**

The Unique Issuer is permitted to issue further Unique Securitized Notes that are fungible with the existing Unique
Securitized Notes in a minimum amount of £25,000,000, provided that, among other things:

- certain ratings requirements are met including that the issue would not lead to a downgrade in the then
current rating of the Unique Securitized Notes, that the further Unique Securitized Notes are issued in
such proportions of Class A Unique Notes and Class N Unique Notes as would maintain the then current
rating of each class of Unique Securitized Notes and that such further Unique Securitized Notes are
assigned ratings that are at least as high as the higher of the then current rating of the relevant series of
Unique Securitized Notes or the rating of such Unique Securitized Notes on the original issue dates;

- it does not lead to a ratings downgrade of the Unique Securitized Notes; and

- the weighted average life of the Unique Securitized Notes then in issue are not varied as a result.

The Unique Issuer may also issue one or more classes of notes to replace an existing class of Unique Securitized
Notes (which would then be redeemed at their principal amount plus the applicable make- whole premium). The
terms of such replacement notes may differ from the then outstanding Unique Securitized Notes. The issue of any
such replacement notes is subject to equivalent requirements as those described above for further notes.

Any incurrence of additional indebtedness by the Parent or its restricted subsidiaries, which will include members
of the Unique Group, will be subject to the covenants and other terms governing the Notes offered hereby. See
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Disposal Provisions_**

Pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, UPP is generally not permitted to sell, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of any of its assets.

However, the Unique Trustee is required to give its consent to the following pub disposals by UPP, provided that
no event of default under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement is outstanding and in each case subject to
the more detailed conditions and provisions set out in the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement:

- during each annual period (from one March loan payment date to another), a disposal (the “Permitted
**Tied Pub Disposal”) of pubs (which, for disposals on or after July 6, 2018, must be pubs that are subject**
to the tie) with an aggregate market value up to the lower of: (i) 5% of the book value of the estate for
that annual period and (ii) an amount that, together with the market value of the pubs already disposed
of in that annual period and the five previous annual periods, is equal to 15% of the book value of the
estate for that period. Such limits may be increased if the rating agencies confirm that such increase
would not result in the downgrading of the then present rating of the Unique Securitized Notes;

- a disposal of further pubs (whether or not such pubs are subject to the tie) where the proceeds are applied
to repay a proportionate amount of the Unique Securitized Notes plus additional Unique Securitized
Notes such that the ratings of the Unique Securitized Notes would be equal to or higher than when
originally issued (and given that the ratings of the Unique Securitized Notes are lower than when they
were originally issued, this disposal power is currently considered to be unavailable);

- from July 6, 2018, a disposal of pubs that are not subject to the tie (“Permitted Commercial Property
**Disposal”) at an aggregate price that is not less than the sum of (a) for pubs that are disposed of to the**
Asset Manager (or any of its affiliate or employee), the aggregate book value of such pubs and (b) for
pubs that are disposed of other than to the Asset Manager (or any of its affiliate or employee), 90% of
the aggregate book value of such pubs; and

- a disposal of the entire Unique Estate provided that the sale proceeds are sufficient to repay all
outstanding Unique Securitized Notes (including applicable redemption premium) and all amounts
payable to creditors that rank in priority to or pari passu with holders of the Unique Securitized Notes.

Proceeds of a Permitted Tied Pub Disposal are paid into a disposals account of UPP and can then be used for (i)
repayments and prepayments of debt under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement and therefore the Unique

190


-----

Securitized Notes, (ii) permitted developments (including capital expenditure or other arrangements for the
development, enhancement or improvement of a pub) provided that the average expected gross yield of the pub
on which the permitted development is carried out is equal to or greater than the historic gross yield of such pub
and/or (iii) the acquisition of a pub business (subject to certain restrictions as set out in the Unique Intercompany
Loan Agreement). If and to the extent that the disposal proceeds have not been so applied within 18 months of the
proceeds being paid into the disposals account, the proceeds shall be used to prepay debt under the Unique
Intercompany Loan Agreement and therefore the Unique Securitized Notes.

Proceeds of a Permitted Commercial Property Disposal (net of selling expenses including any tax liability) must
be used upon, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, such disposal to prepay outstanding loans under and in
accordance with the provisions of the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement.

In relation to the permissions for disposals described above, there are certain restrictions which apply if the pubs
are sold to members of the “AM Group,” being the Asset Manager and any affiliates or employees of the Asset
Manager. Namely, no pub the current or the immediately preceding tenant of which is (or was) a member of the
AM Group may be disposed of to a member of the AM Group within the period of five years from the date of first
occupation of such pub by such member of the AM Group. After such five-year period, such disposal is only
permitted if the gross proceeds of such disposal are at least in the amount of an independent valuation obtained at
a date not more than 90 days before the proposed disposal. These restrictions do not apply, however, to untied
pubs sold pursuant to a Permitted Commercial Property Disposal. There is also a general obligation on UPP’s
management and directors at all times to conduct business with Ei Group entities on an arm’s length basis and in
UPP’s best interests.

**_Dividends and Other Payments_**

The Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement contains restrictions on UPP paying dividends unless certain
conditions are satisfied. In summary, such conditions include the following: (a) no default or event of default is
outstanding; (b) there is at least £65,000,000 in the Reserve Account (or such lesser amount as is described under
“—Unique Accounts” above once there are no Class A Unique Notes outstanding); (c) the DSCR is at least 1.5:1
and (d) the payment is funded from Excess Cash. Excess Cash means the surplus, if any, remaining after the
payment of all items required to be paid by UPP in accordance with the relevant priorities of payment. Excess
Cash as of March 31, 2024 that will be brought forward into the next quarter was £0.2 million.

The Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement also contains restrictions on UPP acquiring a business. UPP is only
able to make such an acquisition if, among certain other conditions, it is a permitted business, no default has
occurred or is then continuing and the acquisition is wholly or partially financed out of (a) a loan under the Unique
Intercompany Loan Agreement (in turn funded by an issuance of further Unique Securitized Notes (as described
in “—Further Issuances” above); (b) Excess Cash (being amounts available to UPP on each interest payment date
under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement having made all payments under the priority of payments
thereunder); or (c) the disposal proceeds from the sale of pubs (subject to certain other conditions) (as to which
please see “—Disposal Provisions” above). Additionally, the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement contains
restrictions on UPP entering into any activity requiring development or remedial capital expenditures, granting of
permissions, consents, licenses or property interests or entry into other arrangements in respect of or for the
purpose of the development, enhancement or improvement of any of its pubs or a permitted business. Such
activities may be undertaken if they are wholly or partially financed out of (i) a loan under the Unique
Intercompany Loan Agreement (in turn funded by an issuance of further Unique Securitized Notes (as described
in “—Further Issuances” above); (ii) Excess Cash; or (iii) amounts standing to the credit of the Disposals Account
received as disposal proceeds (subject to certain other conditions).

The Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, also contains restrictions on UPP regarding incurrence of
indebtedness and giving of guarantees. Carve outs include incurrence of indebtedness and guarantees of
indebtedness (a) up to £3,000,000 under finance leases or hire purchase arrangements; and (b) any other form of
further financial indebtedness provided that it is made on an unsecured and fully subordinated basis (and provided
further that, by its terms, such further subordinated financial indebtedness may only be serviced out of Excess
Cash). Under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, UPP is not permitted to engage in activities outside of
its normal course of business other than in respect of permitted transactions, such as (i) disposals of stock in trade
by UPP in its ordinary course of trade; (ii) acquisitions and disposals of eligible investments; (iii) disposals and
replacements of obsolete or redundant plant and equipment not required for the efficient operation of its business,
on arm’s length terms; (iv) any sale of an asset (other than a pub or other cash generating asset) on arm’s length
terms where the entire proceeds of such sale do not exceed £250,000; and (v) any other transaction consented to
in advance in writing by the trustee.

191


-----

Under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, UPP is allowed to contribute certain amounts ahead of payment
of debt service on each interest payment date under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement (being £26,650,608
as at September 30, 2004 (such amount to be increased (but not reduced) in each subsequent year) into a capital
expenditure account during every twelve month period. In addition, UPP may, after payment of debt service on
each interest payment date under the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, if the DSCR on such interest
payment date is at least 1.5:1, contribute an additional £750,000 to the capex account on such interest payment
date, subject to a cap of £2,000,000 in any four consecutive quarters. There is no amount standing to the credit of
the capex account as of March 30, 2024.

**_Liquidity Facility Agreement_**

The Unique Issuer, the Barclays Bank PLC (the “Original Liquidity Facility Lender”), The Global Loan Agency
Services Limited (the “Liquidity Facility Agent”) and the Unique Trustee are party to the liquidity facility
agreement (the “Liquidity Facility Agreement”) dated June 30, 2021 pursuant to which the Liquidity Facility
Provider and lenders which become a party to the Liquidity Facility Agreement (together with the Original
Liquidity Facility Lender, the “Liquidity Facility Lenders”), has made available to the Unique Issuer a renewable
committed facility (the “Liquidity Facility”) for a term of 364 days on a renewable basis. The Liquidity Facility
Agreement is available for an initial period of 364 days from June 30, 2021 and has been renewed thereafter from
time to time, most recently for an additional term of 364 days from June 26, 2024 to an expiry date of June 25,
2025. The Liquidity Facility Agreement replaces a previous amended and restated liquidity facility agreement
dated February 25, 2005 entered into with NatWest Markets Plc (formerly The Royal Bank of Scotland plc), as
the liquidity facility provider.

As of June 30, 2024, the commitments under the Liquidity Facility were £38,000,000. The Liquidity Facility
Agreement provides for the periodic reduction of the amount of the Liquidity Facility on certain interest payment
date, with the amount of the Liquidity Facility reducing to £12,500,000 for any interest payment date falling in or
after June 2027. The size of the Liquidity Facility from time to time is calculated by reference to the maximum
amount of expected debt service payable in respect of the Class A Unique Notes and the Class N Unique Notes
over any 18-month period on a forward- looking basis taking into account the Required Amount in respect of the
Reserve Account. In addition, if the maximum amount which the rating agencies require to be available for
drawing by the Issuer under the Liquidity Facility in order to maintain the then current ratings of the Unique
Securitized Notes is less than the Liquidity Facility Amount, the excess amount may be cancelled.

The Liquidity Facility is available to the Unique Issuer on each interest payment date in respect of the Unique
Securitized Notes to meet certain of its payment obligations falling due on such date to the extent that the amount
that it receives from UPP pursuant to the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement and amounts standing to the
credit of the Reserve Account are insufficient for those purposes.

The amount of the Liquidity Facility that can be applied towards payment of interest and principal in respect of
the Class N Unique Notes is limited pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement.

On an interest payment date and following the taking of enforcement action within the Unique Securitization, the
Unique Issuer’s obligations to repay amounts due to the Liquidity Facility Lenders pursuant to the Liquidity
Facility Agreement rank ahead of its obligations to make payments in respect of the Unique Securitized Notes
(subject to certain subordinated amounts due to the Liquidity Facility Lenders that rank behind such payments).

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The Issuer is offering £1,644,688,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2029 (the
“Offered Sterling Notes”) and €469,981,000 aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes due
2029 (the “Offered Euro Notes” or “Euro Notes,” and together with the Offered Sterling Notes, the “Offered
**Notes”), to be guaranteed by the Guarantors, under an indenture dated the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) between,**
_inter alios, the Issuer, the Parent (as defined herein), the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein) and Deutsche_
Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”).

In addition, on the Issue Date, the Issuer intends to issue £36,916,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.75%
senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Premium Sterling Notes”), to the Backstop Parties as compensation for their
participation in the backstop arrangements entered into in relation to the Issuance (as defined herein). The Offered
Sterling Notes and the Premium Sterling Notes are hereinafter referred to as “Sterling Notes,” and, the Offered
Notes and the Premium Sterling Notes, are hereinafter referred to as “Notes.”

The Premium Sterling Notes will form part of the original issuance and will constitute a portion of the relevant
series of Sterling Notes. The Premium Sterling Notes and the Offered Sterling Notes will form a single series and
will together with the Euro Notes and any Additional Notes, as applicable be treated as single class of debt
securities under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
In addition, the Premium Sterling Notes and the Offered Sterling Notes will have the same international securities
identification number (“ISIN”) and common codes, and will be fully fungible with each other..

The Notes will be issued by Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc (the “Issuer”), a public limited company
which has been organized as a special purpose finance subsidiary under the laws of England and Wales to facilitate
the offering of debt securities and which has no operations and no assets other than its rights under intercompany
loans made to the Parent in relation to the proceeds of earlier financings. The Issuer will be dependent on payments
by the Parent on these loans, or otherwise funds advanced by the Parent or its subsidiaries, in order to service the
Notes.

In this “Description of the Notes,” the “Parent” refers only to Stonegate Pub Company Limited, the indirect parent
of the Issuer, and any successor obligor to Stonegate Pub Company Limited on the Parent Guarantee (as defined
herein), and not to any of its subsidiaries, including the Issuer; and the “Issuer” refers only to Stonegate Pub
Company Financing 2019 plc, and any successor obligor to Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc on the
Notes.

The issuance of the Notes (the “Issuance”) will be pursuant to private transactions that are not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act (as defined herein). See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the
Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under and will not incorporate
provisions by reference to or is not otherwise subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The
Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as defined herein) will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined herein) and any additional intercreditor agreements entered into in the future. The terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understand the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral
securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”
for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Indenture, the
Notes and the Note Guarantees. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should
refer to the Indenture for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and your rights.

Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth under “Where
_to find additional information.”_

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount.

**Summary Description of the Notes**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be:

- senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with any existing or future
Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated to the Notes;

193


-----

- secured by the Collateral described below along with obligations under the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the Sponsor Subordinated Loan (if entered into),
Hedging Obligations and any Operating Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (although
any liabilities in respect of obligations under any Revolving Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging
Obligations and any Operating Facility that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority over the
Holders with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral);

- senior in right of payment to any Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined herein) of the Issuer, including
the Sponsor Subordinated Loan made under the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement (if entered into);

- effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the Issuer to the
extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes; and

- unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors.

**Principal and Maturity**

On date of the issuance of the Notes (the “Issue Date”), the Issuer will issue £1,681,604,000 aggregate principal
amount of Sterling Notes, inclusive of any Premium Sterling Notes, and €469,981,000 aggregate principal amount
of Euro Notes.

The Notes will mature on July 31, 2029 provided that if, on the date that is 90 days prior to the scheduled maturity
date of the Existing PIK Facility (such date, the “Notes Springing Maturity Date”), the Existing PIK Facility
has not been discharged in full, the maturity date shall be the Notes Springing Maturity Date. The Notes will be
issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, in respect of
the Sterling Notes, or €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in respect of the Euro Notes.
The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

**_Interest on the Sterling Notes_**

Interest on the Sterling Notes will accrue at the rate of 10.75% per annum computed against the principal
outstanding on the Sterling Notes.

Interest on the Notes will be payable in cash, semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year,
commencing on January 31, 2025, to holders of record on the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on
the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if later, the most recent date to which interest has been paid. Interest
on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest
period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**_Interest on the Euro Notes_**

The Euro Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the Euro
Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus 6.625%, as determined by an agent
appointed by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the Indenture (the “Calculation Agent”), which
shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable quarterly in
arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2024.
The Issuer will pay interest to the holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable
interest payment date, as the case may be. Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue from the most recent date to
which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Euro Notes in respect
of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the
Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Euro Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest

194


-----

Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by
365. The Applicable Rate on the Euro Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards
(e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or
resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded
upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in
the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any
calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the holder of any Euro Notes, provide the interest rate
then in effect with respect to the Euro Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Euro Notes to
receive the payments of interest on the Euro Notes will be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation of
interest on the Euro Notes:

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the Determination Date;
provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate
or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major
banks in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation
(expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination
Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If
at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of
such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major
banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as
of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in
euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will
be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest
Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Issuer determines at any time prior to any Interest Calculation
Date, that a Benchmark Event has occurred and/or is continuing, the Issuer, acting in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner and in accordance with the Benchmark Regulation, shall determine a substitute,
alternative or successor rate for purposes of determining the interest rate on each Interest Calculation Date
occurring after such time that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected
by the monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) in the jurisdiction of the applicable
currency or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry
accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Euro Notes; provided that, the Issuer may,
in its sole and good faith judgment, consult with a Rate Determination Agent in making any such determination.

If the Issuer has determined a substitute, alternative or successor rate in accordance with the foregoing paragraph
(such rate, the “Replacement Reference Rate”) for purposes of determining the interest rate on the relevant
Interest Calculation Date falling after such determination:

(i) the Issuer will also determine (a) the Adjustment Spread and (b) changes (if any) (the “Benchmark
**Adjustments”) to the business day convention, the definition of business day, the interest calculation**
date, the day count fraction and any method for calculating the Replacement Reference Rate and any
Adjustment Spread;

195


-----

(ii) without any requirement for the consent or approval of Holders of the Euro Notes, references to
EURIBOR under the Indenture and this Note will be deemed (provided that the Benchmark
Adjustments do not, without the prior agreement of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation
Agent, as applicable, have the effect of increasing the obligations or duties, or decreasing the rights or
protections, of the Trustee, Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent under the Indenture and/or the Euro
Notes) to be references to the relevant Replacement Reference Rate, including any Benchmark
Adjustments; and

(iii) the Issuer will give notice as soon as reasonably practicable to the Holders of the Euro Notes (in
accordance with the Indenture) specifying the Replacement Reference Rate (including any Benchmark
Adjustments).

None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or
inaction of the Issuer or (if applicable) the Rate Determination Agent or its (or their) determination of the
Replacement Reference Rate, any Benchmark Adjustments or other related changes.

The determination of the Replacement Reference Rate, any Benchmark Adjustments and the other matters referred
to above by the Issuer and the Rate Determination Agent (as applicable) will be final and binding on the Issuer,
the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent and the Holders of the Euro Notes. The Trustee, Paying
Agent and Calculation Agent shall not be required to participate in the determination or selection of Replacement
Reference Rate, any Adjustment Spread or Benchmark Adjustments and shall not be required to investigate or
verify the adequacy, accuracy or sufficiency of such, nor shall the Trustee, Paying Agent and Calculation be
responsible for determining what is customary or prevailing in the market at such time.

If the Issuer is unable to or otherwise fails to determine the Replacement Reference Rate, Adjustment Spread (if
any) or Benchmark Adjustments (if any), by the date ten Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Calculation
Date or if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided by the Issuer with respect to such
Replacement Reference Rate, Adjustment Spread (if any) or Benchmark Adjustments (if any) and, if necessary,
after consultation with the Issuer) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate applicable to the Interest
Period commencing immediately following such Interest Calculation Date, then EURIBOR in respect of such
Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

No later than the date on which the Holders of the Euro Notes are notified by the Issuer as provided under (iii)
above, the Issuer shall deliver to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent an Officer’s
Certificate (on which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely
without further enquiry or liability):

(i) confirming (I) that a Benchmark Event has occurred and the date on which the Issuer determined that a
Benchmark Event had occurred; (II) if applicable, that the Rate Determination Agent meets the
requirements under the Indenture; (III) the Replacement Reference Rate and any Adjustment Spread
(along with an explanation in reasonable detail as to the methodologies underlying the determination of
the Replacement Reference Rate, any Adjustment Spread and any Benchmark Adjustments); and/or (IV)
where applicable, the specific terms of any Benchmark Adjustments, in each case, as determined in
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (1); and

(ii) certifying that the Benchmark Adjustments, to the best of its knowledge and belief (I) are necessary to
ensure the proper operation of such Replacement Reference Rate and/or Adjustment Spread; and (II)
have been drafted solely to such effect.

The sum of the Replacement Reference Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall in no event be less than
0.0%.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the following terms are defined as follows:

“Adjustment Spread” means either a spread (which may be positive or negative) or the formula or methodology
for calculating a spread, in either case, which the Issuer, acting in good faith, determines is required to be applied
to the Replacement Reference Rate to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders of the Euro Notes as a result of
the replacement of EURIBOR with the Replacement Reference Rate and is the spread, formula or methodology
which:

196


-----

(a) is formally recommended in relation to the replacement of EURIBOR with the Replacement Reference
Rate by any competent authority; or (if no such recommendation has been made)

(b) the Issuer determines, acting in good faith, is recognized or acknowledged as being the industry
standard for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Euro Notes or for over-the-counter
derivative transactions which reference EURIBOR, where such rate has been replaced by the
Replacement Reference Rate; or (if the Issuer determines that no such industry accepted standard is
recognized or acknowledged)

(c) the Issuer, in its discretion, acting in good faith, determines to be appropriate.

“Benchmark Event” means:

(a) a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(b) EURIBOR ceasing to be published for a period of at least 5 Business Days or EURIBOR ceasing to
exist;

(c) the issuance of a public statement by the administrator of EURIBOR that it will, by a specified date
within the following six months, cease publishing EURIBOR permanently or indefinitely (in
circumstances where no successor administrator has been appointed that will continue publication of
EURIBOR);

(d) the issuance of a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of EURIBOR that EURIBOR
has been or will, by a specified date within the following six months, be permanently or indefinitely
discontinued;

(e) the issuance of a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of EURIBOR that means
EURIBOR will be prohibited from being used or that its use will be subject to restrictions or adverse
consequences, in each case within the following six months;

(f) the occurrence of a change in the customary market practice in the international capital markets
applicable generally to euro-denominated floating rate notes in the European market (determined
according to factors including, but not limited to, public statements, opinions and publications of
industry bodies and organizations) to refer to a base rate other than EURIBOR, despite the continued
existence of EURIBOR; or

(g) it has become unlawful for the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, any third party agent or the

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Parent’s compliance with the covenant described under the heading “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms_
substantially identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and,
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates,
the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest

Premium Sterling Notes, as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes shall be treated, along with all other
Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters
which are not specifically distinguished for such series. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series with any Notes previously issued if they have
terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes
sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with any Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or
other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued
Notes. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously

198


-----

issued without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a
**U.S. holder (as defined under “Certain Definitions—Other Definitions”) considering the purchase of Notes**
**sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should**
**consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the**
**purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of**
**Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax**
**purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.**

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined under “—Additional Amounts”), if any,
on the Global Notes (as defined under “—Transfer and Exchange”) will be payable at the specified office or
agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined under “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the
_Notes”); provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered_
in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer to the
Person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent,
_Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes.”_

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes for so long as the
Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The initial Transfer Agent will
be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive
Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and the Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent (as
applicable) will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.
The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Calculation Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without
prior notice to the Holders. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer
will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

    - Each series of the Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

    - The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

    - Each series of the Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the United States
in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

199


-----

    - The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common depositary
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests
in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of
Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prior to the date that is 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the
Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be limited to Persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer
of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period, unless such resale or transfer is made
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may
be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the
transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any
other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book- Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, or €100,000 aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, as applicable, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent or the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to,
and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, or €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, as applicable. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture requires the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer
or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes
payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be redeemed in
part;

200


-----

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to
such Notes;

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer (as defined under “—Change of Control”) or an Asset Disposition Offer (as defined under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”); or

(5) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next succeeding interest
payment date.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be entitled to treat the Holder
as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

All the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries, except for Platinum Topco and its Subsidiaries which
will be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture. The Parent will not however be permitted to
designate further Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in the future. Other than as described herein,
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture.

**Note Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will be, guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Parent and by
each existing material wholly owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent, subject to certain exceptions. Each
Restricted Subsidiary that provides a guarantee of the Notes (a “Subsidiary Note Guarantee”) is referred to
herein as a “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent as the “Guarantors.” The Subsidiary Guarantors
consist of: (i) Leased and Tenanted Pubs 1 Limited, (ii) Bay Restaurant Holdings Limited, (iii) Plato Company 3
Limited, (iv) Plato Restaurant Holdings Limited, (v) Barley Pub Company Limited, (vi) Bay Restaurant Group
Limited, (vii) Falcon Propco 1 Limited, (viii) Hops Pub Company Limited, (ix) Intertain Limited, (x) Intertain
(Bars) Limited, (xi) Intertain (Bars) II Limited, (xii) Intertain (Bars) III Limited, (xiii) Intertain (Bars) IV Limited,
(xiv) Hull Propco Limited, (xv) Slug and Lettuce Company Limited, (xvi) Town and City Pub Group Limited,
(xvii) Be At One Holdings Limited, (xviii) Be At One Limited, (xx) Ei Group Limited, (xxi) Enterprise Managed
Investments Limited and (xxii) The Craft Union Pub Company Limited.

The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors include each entity that will guarantee the Revolving
Facilities Agreement (in addition to the Issuer) and the Second Lien Loans. Consistent with the Agreed Security
Principles, none of the members of the Unique Group will provide a Subsidiary Note Guarantee.

In addition, after the Issue Date, in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral,” under certain circumstances the Parent will cause a Restricted_
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to become a Guarantor. The new Guarantor will also, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, be required to pledge assets in favor of the Subsidiary Note Guarantee as described under “—
_Security.”_

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

Each Note Guarantee is limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject
to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any
comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or
a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Structure—Each Note Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Note Guarantee provided by the Parent (the “Parent Guarantee” and together with the Subsidiary Note
Guarantees, the “Note Guarantees”) and the Subsidiary Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate
upon:

201


-----

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a Holding Entity thereof, such
that such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially
all the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case
in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) [Reserved];

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge;”_

(4) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Note Guarantee issued on the
Issue Date), to the extent that the relevant Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees
_and Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of Indebtedness referred to in_
such paragraph;

(5) in the case of any Note Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the
provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown;”

(6) upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;
or

(7) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured
Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if
any) of those Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Parent, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be
effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any)
of any current and future Subsidiaries of the Parent that do not become Guarantors.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable Transaction Security Documents and
the grant of further Permitted Collateral Liens, the Notes will be secured by fixed and floating security over
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors granted in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit
of the secured parties (which includes the Trustee on behalf of the Holders) including, subject to certain exclusions
(where applicable):

(a) first fixed equitable security over real property, but excluding any leasehold real property that has 25
years or less to run on the lease or has a rack-rent payable in respect thereof together with all buildings
and fixtures (including trade fixtures) on that real property;

(b) first fixed charge over certain tangible moveable property, certain intellectual property, certain bank
accounts in England and Wales, good will and rights in relation to the uncalled capital, certain
investments and all monetary claims (including in respect of intellectual property, investments and
insurance policies);

(c) first floating charge over all of its present and future assets and undertaking;

(d) security over all shares in the Issuer and the Guarantors; provided that the security granted by Midco (as
defined herein) in the shares of the Parent will be non-recourse to Midco other than in relation to the
charged shares;

(e) the assignment of rights of Midco in respect of receivables owed to it by the Parent; provided that the
security granted by Midco (as defined herein) in the receivables owed to it by the Parent will be nonrecourse to Midco other than in relation to the assigned rights; and

202


-----

(f) the assignment of rights of the Issuer and the Guarantors under certain insurance policies,

(collectively, the “Collateral”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security may not be perfected in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

- if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders and the other
secured parties;

- if providing such security requires consent of a third party and, if the asset is material, such consent
cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

- if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules or similar matters or
entering into the Transaction Security Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors,
contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the
part of directors or officers;

- if the granting of security or perfecting such security would have a material adverse effect on the ability
of such Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted
by the Indenture;

- in the case of bank accounts, notices to the banks with whom the accounts are maintained will only be
served if required by local laws to perfect the relevant security; and

- no guarantee or security will be provided by any member of the Unique Group or in respect of any assets
of the Unique Group.

**_Administration and Enforcement of Security_**

The Transaction Security Documents and the Collateral are administered by a Security Agent (or in certain
circumstances a receiver or delegate) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all the secured
parties. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The ability of Holders to realize the Collateral will be subject to various insolvency law limitations in the event
of the Parent’s insolvency and various contractual limitations set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure—English and Cayman Islands insolvency laws and other jurisdictions_
_may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our_
_Structure—Each Note Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Transaction Security Documents provide that the rights of the Holders with respect to the Collateral must be
exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Transaction Security Documents, Holders
may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the
Transaction Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as
applicable. The Security Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Transaction Security
Documents at the direction of the Trustee that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
without requiring any consent of the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture, the Holders, in certain circumstances, share in the ability to direct the Trustee to direct the Security
Agent to commence enforcement action under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Subject to the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have the right to remain
in possession and retain control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the Transaction
Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in connection with the
issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after
the payment of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement or other super priority obligations would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu

203


-----

basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, the Notes and the Note Guarantees—The Notes are secured only_
_to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as security for the Notes and_
_the Note Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the_
_Note Guarantees.”_

The creditors under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the Sponsor
Subordinated Loan (if entered into), the Trustee, and by accepting a Note, each Holder for the Notes, will have or
will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed Barclays Bank PLC, as Security Agent, in each case to act as its security agent
under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which the security agent is a party
(including, without limitation, the Transaction Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which
the Security Agent is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii)
execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to
enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the terms of the Transaction Security Documents themselves provide for assets to cease to become
subject to security in certain circumstances without the need for a formal release (such as the sale of assets which
are subject to a charge) or the exclusion of certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to
security (such as, for example, assets that may not be validly pledged or assets that are subject to a Permitted
Lien).

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent shall release, and the Trustee shall release and if so requested direct the Security Agent to
release, without the need for consent of the Holders, Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the
Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof;

(2) upon release of a Note Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such Note Guarantee granted by
such Guarantor);

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person; provided that if the Collateral is disposed
to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant Collateral becomes immediately subject to a
substantially equivalent Lien in favor of the Security Agent securing the Notes (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”);
provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;

(4) [Reserved];

(5) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured
Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest;”_

(7) in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture; and

(8) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”

204


-----

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on
the part of the Trustee.

**IPO Pushdown**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Parent shall be entitled to require (by written
notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified
in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that: (i) references to the Parent
and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and
its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity and the
shares of the Issuer shall be subject to a Lien in favor of the “Secured Parties” (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), that is substantially equivalent to
the pledge of the shares of the Issuer entered into in or about the Issue Date; (ii) all financial ratio, basket
calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference
in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the
“Parent” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and
unless the context requires otherwise); and provided that nothing in this paragraph (a), including the
deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown
Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Parent, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of
Default; (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default in the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction
Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is Subsidiary (whether
in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding
Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall
be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the
Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any
such Holding Company (subject to sub-clause (i) above); and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the
Parent: (A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an “Investor” or an “Intra-Group Lender” shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all
obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(and from the date specified by the Parent that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case
may be, and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be); and (B)
there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be;
and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case
may be, as a consequence of this paragraph (a), any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person be
an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, or that any liabilities or obligations to such Person
be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise
subordinated shall cease to apply. An IPO Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be
deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or
amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents
required by the Parent in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in order to
facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above (the “IPO Pushdown”);
provided that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, does not affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee under such amendment replacement or other
document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized and
instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such amended or

205


-----

replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the
request of and at the cost of the Parent).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Parent notified to the Trustee by the Parent in writing as the Person to be treated as the
IPO Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided that: (i) the IPO Entity shall be a Restricted
Subsidiary which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a
Holding Company of such member of the Group); (ii) the Issuer shall become a Restricted Subsidiary of
the IPO Pushdown Entity; and (iii) the Parent may not designate as the IPO Pushdown Entity any entity
which is not a direct or indirect Holding Company of Restricted Subsidiaries constituting all or
substantially all of the Group’s assets.

(d) If the Parent delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) above in relation to a
contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the
occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown
Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) to
(a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been
released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee
by prior written notice to the Parent and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Transaction
Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be,
has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance
on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written notice to the Parent and that Person,
that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Parent from
delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of
a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of
any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step
taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was
effective or otherwise).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving
Facilities Agreement, Hedging Agreements and any Operating Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
that are secured by Collateral that also secures our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, will
receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. Any
remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations under the
Revolving Facilities Agreement, Hedging Agreements and any Operating Facility have been repaid from such
recoveries, will be applied, first, pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and any
other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant
to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, second, in repayment
of all obligations under the Second Lien Facility Agreement and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the
Guarantors permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement on a pari passu basis with the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

**_Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Parent, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing by
the Issuer, the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the
Collateral, the Issuer, the Parent, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as
applicable, shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement or a restatement, amendment or other modification
of the existing Intercreditor Agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or on terms that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent are
not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the
application of the proceeds of the collateral held thereunder and the means of enforcement, it being understood

206


-----

that an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not be deemed to be less favorable to the Holders and will be permitted
by this covenant if the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and any Lien in its favor is permitted by the “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” covenants; provided_
that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the
opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, the term “Intercreditor Agreement” shall include
references to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement
entered into on or prior to the Issue Date.

The Indenture will provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, the
Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (ii) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any such
agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (iii) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture), (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens (vi)
effect the IPO Pushdown or (vii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to
any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted
by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the
opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the
Indenture relating to the Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted
the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any one or more
amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement as contemplated above.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes of a series, it will, if and for so long as the Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, inform the
Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of that series that
will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

Any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent
(including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering).
In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the notice of
redemption may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any
or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption
date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60
days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close

208


-----

of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all the Notes of a series are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select
the Notes of such series for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange,
if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Issuer, and in compliance with the
requirements of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed, or such exchange prescribes no
method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool- factor; provided, however,
that no Note of €100,000 or £100,000, as the case may be, or less in aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed
in part. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar shall be liable for selections made by it under this
paragraph.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of
the Exchange so require, the Issuer shall notify the Exchange of such redemption and, in addition to such
publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the
Registrar.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption, unless the redemption price is
not paid on the redemption date.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Company (as defined herein) may redeem, and a Guarantor may cause the Issuer or
Successor Company to redeem, the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (see “—Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date
as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Additional Amounts”) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including pursuant to a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing
in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes or
any Note Guarantee would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts or increased Additional Amounts, and
such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor Company or
Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable and, in the case of a payment by a Guarantor, having the Issuer or another Guarantor make the payment,

209


-----

but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes), provided, that none of
the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor shall be required to take any measures which in its good faith
determination would result in the imposition on any of the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor of any
material legal or regulatory burden or any material cost. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result
of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date on which the applicable
Notes are issued, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date on which the applicable
Notes are issued. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction
that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change
in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(or, in the case of a Successor Company, on or after the date of assumption by the Successor Company of the
Issuer’s obligations hereunder). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with
the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless
at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the
publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer, Successor
Company or Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect
such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to
redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by
taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing
to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a Successor Company under or with respect to the Notes, or
any Guarantor with respect to any Note Guarantee, (each of the Issuer, Successor Company and Guarantor, a
“Payor”) will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes
unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or
on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having
power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Issuer, Successor Company, Guarantor or their agents, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or
Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, purchase or redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the
Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the
case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such
payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, being a
citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, incorporated in, or the existence of a business, a
permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management present or

210


-----

deemed present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising
solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or Note Guarantee, the enforcement of
rights under a Note or Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial
owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, required by applicable
law, regulation, treaty or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from or reduction in the rate of all or part of such Tax; provided in each case the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, capital gains, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed in connection with
Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”), any
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction implementing or
relating to FATCA or any non-U.S. law, regulation or guidance enacted or issued with respect thereto;

(6) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first
made available for payment to the Holder (except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that
would have been imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day period);

(7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or any
Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or
settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such
payment or Note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note; or

(8) any combination of the above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to
obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and if so obtained by the Payor will
provide such certified copies to the Trustee. If so obtained, such copies shall be made available to the Holders
upon request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding
Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount
of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per £1,000 or €1,000, as applicable,
principal amount of the Notes.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any
payment made on any Note or Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee and Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises, or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in
which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30
days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate without further inquiry, as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

211


-----

(2) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Note Guarantees,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or
similar Taxes that are imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, registration or
enforcement of any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture the Transaction Security Documents or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than any document or instrument entered into in connection with
a transfer or exchange of the Notes).

The foregoing obligations of this “Additional Amounts” section will survive any termination, defeasance or
discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer
or any Guarantor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all (equal to £100,000 or €100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of £1,000 or
€1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “Change of_
Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_
days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of any such Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy
to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

212


-----

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes
so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or an
authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail
(or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive
Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if
any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least £100,000 or
€100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change
of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the purchase date will be no earlier than 30
days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is mailed.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the
Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to
repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking
to acquire the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a
Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the applicable series of Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of
redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an
interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least
90% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of then outstanding Notes have validly tendered
and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable,
Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as
applicable.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection
with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable

213


-----

securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

A Change of Control will result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and a right
to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Second Lien Facility Agreement. Future debt of the Parent or
its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of
Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient
funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Structure—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change_
_of control.”_

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain
control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make
a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons.

Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may
be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness
if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most
recently ended four full trading quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a
maximum aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness then outstanding not exceeding £274.0 million,
plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being
guaranteed is permitted under the terms of the Indenture (other than pursuant to this clause (2));
provided that, if Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated or pari passu to the Notes or a
Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu to the Notes or Note
Guarantees, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed; or

214


-----

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is
permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Parent owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) other than in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in connection with credit
management, cash management, cash pooling, netting, setting off or similar arrangements in the
ordinary course of business of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries, if the Issuer or any
Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not the Issuer or a Guarantor,
such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in
cash of all obligations then due (x) in the case of the Issuer, with respect to the Notes, or (y) in
the case of a Guarantor, with respect to its Note Guarantee, in each case in the manner and to
the extent provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than
the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence
of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by:

(a) (x) any Notes and any Note Guarantee not exceeding £1,682 million plus €470 million and (y)
the Second Lien Loans and any Guarantee of the Second Lien Loans not exceeding £157.0
million;

(b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (3), (4)(a) and (7) of this
paragraph) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or outstanding on the Issue
Date after giving effect to the Transactions;

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness that is Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause
(4) (other than Refinancing Indebtedness that is Incurred in respect of any Notes and any Note
Guarantee, which will be deemed to have been Incurred under clause (4)(a)(x) of this paragraph
and Refinancing Indebtedness that is incurred in respect of the Second Lien Loans, which shall
be deemed to have been Incurred under clause (4)(a)(y) of this paragraph) or clause (5) of this
paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(d) Management Advances and MEP Payments; and

(e) the Unique Securitized Notes; provided that if the Group Incurs any Unique Securitized Notes
on or after the Issue Date, such Unique Securitized Notes either (i) shall be utilized for the
purpose of refinancing Indebtedness of the Unique Group in a principal amount not exceeding
the principal amount of the Unique Securitized Notes outstanding after giving effect to the
Transactions (including for the avoidance of doubt after the repayment of the Class A4 Notes),
or (ii) if issued in excess of such amounts, (x) the net proceeds of such Incurrence in excess of
the amount required to refinance shall promptly be applied to redeem the Notes (including
where applicable making the payment of any premium and accrued but unpaid interest), (y) the
yield to maturity at issuance on such Unique Securitized Notes must be at least 1.50% less than
the all-in yield to maturity applicable to the Notes as at the Issuance Date, including all and any
applicable premia or prepayment fees, calculated on the same basis in good faith by the Parent,
and (z) the final maturity of such Unique Securitized Notes shall not be earlier than that of the
Notes to be redeemed with the proceeds thereof, provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that other
than the Unique Securitized Notes Incurred pursuant to this clause 4(e) and the Unique Liquidity
Facility specified at clause (14), the Unique Group will not be permitted to Incur any other
Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant or otherwise under clauses (1) through
(14) hereof.

-----

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including
pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or (ii) Incurred to provide or refinance all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate
a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary
or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in connection with or
contemplation of such acquisition; provided, however, with respect to sub-clauses (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that
at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been permitted to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant after giving pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and Incurrence of such Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full trading quarters for which internal financial statements
are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would
not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Hedging Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Parent or its
Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price

(B) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction,
installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and (C) any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of sub-clauses (A) or (B), in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (i) £41
million and (ii) 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees

the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations, indemnities or guarantees
Incurred in the ordinary course of business or for governmental or regulatory requirements, (b) letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to

drawing of such letters of credit or other instrument, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days
following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business, and
(d) any credit management, cash management, cash pooling, netting, setting off or similar arrangements

banking arrangements to manage cash balances of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries;
and

216


-----

(c) Indebtedness Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with bankers’ acceptances,
discounted bills of exchange or the discounting or factoring of receivables for credit
management purposes, in each case, Incurred or undertaken in the ordinary course of business;

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect thereof and the aggregate principal amount of all
other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of
(i) £50 million and (ii) 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, and _provided that the aggregate principal_
amount of Indebtedness Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors shall
not exceed £7 million;

(12) [Reserved];

(13) [Reserved]; and

(14) Incurrence by any member of the Unique Group of Indebtedness under any Unique Liquidity Facility.

_provided that, the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness)_
that may be incurred or issued, as applicable, pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (1),
(4)(a), (5), (11) and (12) (plus any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) by Restricted Subsidiaries that
are not Guarantors or the Issuer (other than the Unique Group, which will be permitted to incur Indebtedness
pursuant to clause (4)(e) and (14) only) shall not exceed the greater of (i) £82 million and (ii) 20.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA (in each case, determined on the date of such incurrence).

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with this covenant:

(i) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Parent, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item (or any portion of such item) of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one
of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that the
Parent may not reclassify Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date that is Incurred under subclauses (1), (4)(a)(y), (4)(e) and clause (14) of the second paragraph of this covenant. For the
avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Facilities Agreement is
Incurred under sub-clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be
reclassified;

(ii) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clauses
(1), (7) or (11) of the second paragraph of this covenant or the first paragraph of this covenant
and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iv) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(v) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA”, (x) pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for
the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on
the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities)
or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the
period of the most recent four consecutive trading quarters ending prior to the date for which
such internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent are available;

217


-----

(vi) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as described under
the definition of “Indebtedness;” provided that the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that
is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect
thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change in IFRS itself or a change
from IFRS to a different set of accounting principles, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Parent, on the date first committed, in the
case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility, or, at the option of the Parent, on the date of
pricing, in the case of Public Debt; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to
have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premium (including
tender premium), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b)
the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so
long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in pound sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made
under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling
Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or in respect of the Parent’s or any
Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Parent (other than Disqualified Stock)
or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Parent or in
Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase,
repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”);_

(4) make any payment (other than by capitalization of interest) on or with respect to, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding, the
Sponsor Subordinated Loan made under the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement or any Second Lien
Loan; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person;

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) to (5) above are referred to herein as a “Restricted
**Payment”), if at the time the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:**

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result
immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) (x) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not permitted to Incur an additional £1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or (y) the_
Consolidated Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such Restricted
Payment would exceed 5.15 to 1.0; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
permitted below by clauses (5)(a) (without duplication of amounts paid pursuant to any other
clause of the second succeeding paragraph), (6), (10), (11) and (12) of the second succeeding
paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding
paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period)
from the first day of the first trading quarter commencing after the Issue Date to the
end of the most recent trading quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted
Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent are
available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of
such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value of property or
assets or marketable securities, received by the Parent from the issue or sale of its
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or

contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares) of the Parent subsequent to the Issue Date (other than
(x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an
issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock

Subsidiary, and (y) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities to

assets or marketable securities, received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
from the issuance or sale (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or an
employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Parent or any Subsidiary of
the Parent for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary) by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the
Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital
Stock of the Parent (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market
value of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange) but excluding (x) Net Cash
Proceeds to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds
in reliance on clause (6) of the second succeeding paragraph and (y) the Equity
Contribution;

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by the Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries subsequent to the Issue Date resulting from:

(A) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any such
Restricted Investment, proceeds realized upon the sale or other disposition to
a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of any such
Restricted Investment, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of
assets (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest payments or
returns of capital) to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries

exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments

Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this sub-clause
(iv), was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments
referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c);

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for_
purposes of the preceding sub-clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Parent’s option)
included under this sub-clause (iv); and

(v) the amount of the cash and the fair market value of property or assets or of marketable

extent funded by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Affiliate
to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for_
purposes of the preceding sub-clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Parent’s option)
included under this sub-clause (v).

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding paragraph shall be the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent. The fair
market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount.

Entity or an Affiliate the issuance of Designated Preference Shares) of the Parent or loaned or contributed
as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the Parent, from the issuance or sale of such Designated
Preference Shares.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not make any

of the Unique Group) shall not make any Investment in the Unique Group, except in the ordinary course of
business.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, distributions to the Group of the proceeds of any sale of the
Platinum Group, including through repayment of the subordinated loan issued to the Group by the Platinum Group
or any member or asset thereof, shall not increase the amounts available to the Parent to make Restricted Payments

for the purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, for the purposes of paragraph (11) of the definition of Permitted Payments and paragraphs
(11) and (17) of the definition of Permitted Investments.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether
owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or
asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted
Liens if the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with,
or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured (provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness pursuant to
clauses (1) or (6) of such second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” may
have priority not materially less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the Revolving Facilities under the
Intercreditor Agreement), and (b) in the case of any property or assets that constitute Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of

223


-----

original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increase in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Parent or
the Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Parent or the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Parent or the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent or the Issuer;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (or any guarantee or security granted
in connection therewith), including the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the Sponsor Subordinated Loan
Agreement and the Revolving Facilities Agreement, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, or the Note Guarantees,
(c) the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security
Documents, (d) any Unique Securitized Notes, any Unique Liquidity Facility or any guarantee or security
granted in connection with any Unique Securitized Notes or any Unique Liquidity Facility, in each case
outstanding after giving effect to the Transactions or (e) any other agreement or instrument in effect at
or entered into on the Issue Date, including, in each case, any amendments, restatements, modifications,
renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings, provided that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions
than those contained in those agreements referred to in sub-clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) above, as
applicable (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Parent or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection
with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the

224


-----

Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent)
or that the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred
that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Parent’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with industry practices;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order (including encumbrances or restrictions on making distributions in cash or Cash
Equivalents as a dividend or otherwise that arise or exist by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order) or encumbrances or restrictions required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, suppliers
or landlords under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Facilities Agreement, together with
the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent) and where, in the case
of clause (ii), the Parent determines at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes; or

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted by the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

225


-----

(1) the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise)
at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% (or in the case of an Asset Disposition to an Affiliate,
100%) of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief
from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other
than Indebtedness) received by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the
form of cash.

Within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may apply an
amount equal to such Net Available Cash at the option of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) (1) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Secured Indebtedness (including
Indebtedness Incurred under sub-clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof);
provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption
of Indebtedness pursuant to this sub-clause (1) (except in the case of any revolving
Indebtedness, including but not limited to the Revolving Facilities Agreement), the Parent or
such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment
to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid,
purchased or redeemed; provided, further, that in the case of the prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption of Senior Secured Indebtedness other than the Revolving Facilities, the
Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the Notes on a pro rata basis with such other
Senior Secured Indebtedness; (2) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, and other than Indebtedness of the Unique Group that
would be repaid, purchased or redeemed from the proceeds of Asset Dispositions not made by
the Unique Group); or (3) in the case of an Asset Disposition that does not constitute Collateral,
to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (I) Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed
to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal
amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through repurchase of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness in the open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual optional redemption
provisions applicable thereto or (II) Senior Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount
of such Senior Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through repurchase of such Senior Indebtedness in the
open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual optional redemption provisions applicable
thereto; provided that in the case of the prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Pari
Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness (in each case, other than the Notes) pursuant to subclause (3), the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the Notes on a pro rata basis with
such other Indebtedness;

(b) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) within
365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made
pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Parent that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this
requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent; provided, however, that any

226


-----

such capital expenditure made that is executed or approved within such time will only satisfy
this requirement so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(d) [Reserved]; or

(e) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a), (b), (c),_
(d) or (e) above, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise
invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the above, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not conduct any sale and lease back of
any real property if the total aggregate consideration received in cash or other non-cash form from such transaction
would, in the aggregate with the total aggregate consideration received in cash or other non-cash form from all
other such sale and leaseback transactions of real property after the Issue Date, exceed £500 million.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal
to the difference will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the
546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement
or commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the
second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Parent elects, if the aggregate
amount of “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture exceeds the greater of £21 million and 5.1% of Consolidated
EBITDA, the Parent will be required to make an offer (or procure an offer is made) (“Asset Disposition Offer”)
to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Parent so elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such
Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the “Excess
Proceeds,” at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the “Excess Proceeds,” the Parent may
use any remaining “Excess Proceeds” for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
“Excess Proceeds,” the “Excess Proceeds” shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, or by such other method as (i) the Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar
representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, after consultation with the Parent, deem fair and appropriate (and
in such manner as complies with applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of
calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in pound sterling or euro,
as the case may be based on the denomination of the applicable Notes, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by
converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as the case
may be, determined as of a date selected by the Parent that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined
herein). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of “Excess Proceeds” shall be reset at zero.

Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be allocated between the
Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amounts of the Euro Notes
and the Sterling Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated
that is actually received upon converting such portion of Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business

227


-----

Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Parent will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they
so elect, any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
**Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and**
Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and,
in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000
or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. The Parent will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five
Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver (or procure the mail or
delivery) to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or
amend the Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will (via an
authenticating agent) authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to
such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided
that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of £100,000 or
€100,000 or in integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. Any Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Parent or the Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Parent or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Parent and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; and

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from Persons who
are not the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary.

The Parent will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e)
of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes
pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange
rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Parent will comply (or procure compliance) with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by
virtue of any conflict.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Parent is unable to
obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Parent determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will
obtain and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of such Notes on another stock
exchange deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service, and treating all disposals of sites to an Affiliate cumulatively as one
related transaction) with any Affiliate of the Parent (such transaction or series of related transactions, an “Affiliate
**Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of £5 million unless:**

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Parent or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of £18 million
and 4.4% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have
been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above; and

(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £20 million, the Parent
delivers to the Trustee a written opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that the
transaction (a) is fair to the Parent and the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or Subsidiaries from a financial
point of view, or (b) meets the requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to sub-clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any Holding Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto and any transaction
pursuant to or in connection with an MEP, incentive scheme, deferred compensation or similar
arrangement (including any MEP Payment);

(4) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding
Entity (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of
such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements
and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced
from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not materially more
disadvantageous to the Holders taken as a whole in the good faith judgment of an Officer of the Parent
and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection
with any Public Offering;

229


-----

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement (including any transactions
which are entered into with any Holding Entity or Unrestricted Subsidiary in order to satisfy the
obligations arising under any Tax Sharing Agreement) and the formation and maintenance of any
consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course
of business;

(8) any payments arising on the exercise of any put or call options (or any equivalent right or obligation) in
relation to any Associate or transactions with customers, clients, landlords, suppliers or purchasers or
sellers of goods or services, which, in each case, are in the ordinary course of business and are either fair
to the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms no less favorable
than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Parent or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated
Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent in their reasonable determination, (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with
respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable and
(c) directors’ qualifying shares and shares issued to foreign nationals as required by applicable law;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) below, (a) payments by the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including
through any Holding Entity) of annual management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related
expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of £4.0 million and 0.9% of Consolidated
EBITDA in each twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date, and (b) customary payments by
the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including
through any Holding Entity) for financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or placement
services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or
divestitures, which payments in respect of this sub-clause (b) are approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted
Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Parent and its Subsidiaries;

(13) [Reserved]; and

(14) any transaction as to which the Parent delivers to the Trustee a written opinion from an Independent
Financial Advisor stating that the transaction (a) is fair to the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries from
a financial point of view, or (b) meets the requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors,
or if there are no Disinterested Directors, by complying with the requirements of clause (3) of the first paragraph
of this covenant. A ‘‘Disinterested Director’’ means, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction, a member of the
Board of Directors of the Parent and the relevant Restricted Subsidiary having no material financial interest in or
with respect to such Affiliate Transaction, provided that if the Affiliate Transaction is with TDR Capital or its
Affiliates, any employee, investor or partner of TDR Capital or its Affiliates shall not be a Disinterested Director.
A member of the Board of Directors of the Parent shall be deemed not to have such a financial interest by reason
of such member’s holding Capital Stock of the Parent or any Holding Company of the Parent or any options,
warrants or other rights in respect of such Capital Stock.

230


-----

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Parent’s trading year, and in respect of the trading year ending 53
weeks ending September 29, 2024, by January 27, 2025, annual reports containing, to the extent
applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Parent as of the end
of the two most recent trading years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash
flow of the Parent for the two most recent trading years, including complete footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma
income statement information and balance sheet information of the Parent (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not
reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed trading year (and
which have not already been the subject of pro forma information provided by the Parent); (c) an
operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of the Parent, and a discussion of
material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the
business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate transactions and a description
of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of
material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 75 days following the end of the first three trading quarters in each trading year of the Parent, and
in respect of the trading quarter ended January 19, 2025, by April 4, 2025, quarterly reports of the Parent
containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the
end of such trading quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most
recently completed trading quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet
date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited
pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the Parent (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the
extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant trading quarter
(and which have not already been the subject of pro forma information provided by the Parent); (c) an
operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Parent,
and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and
contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring, merger or similar
transaction, or any senior executive officer changes at the Parent or change in auditors of the Parent or
any other material event that the Parent announces publicly, a report containing a description of such
event.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that in the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, earlier periods may
be presented on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for below, no report need include separate
financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Parent. At the Parent’s election it may also include financial
statements of a Holding Entity in lieu of those for the Parent; provided that, if the financial statements of a Holding
Entity are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the financial
statements of the Holding Entity and the Parent shall be included for any period after the Issue Date. Following
an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on a
recognized stock exchange, the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been
fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Parent, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted

231


-----

Subsidiaries of the Parent or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited
reconciliation to the financial information of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the
following items: revenue, finance costs, profit/loss for the period, cash and cash equivalents, total assets, total
liabilities, equity and capital expenditures.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clause (1), (2) and (3) of the
first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies
of such reports on such password protected website as may be then maintained by the Parent and its Subsidiaries
or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described
in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish
such reports to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes.

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph
of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent
the rules of the Exchange so require, at the offices of the Listing Agent in Jersey.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Parent is not subject
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Parent shall
furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for information
purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein,
including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

So long as any notes are outstanding, the Parent will reasonably promptly after the publication of each of the
annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant starting with
the first full fiscal quarter ending after the Issue Date, conduct, use commercially reasonable efforts to hold a
conference call, which conference call will be open to all Holders, to discuss such reports and the results of
operations for the relevant reporting period.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer and the Parent_

Neither the Issuer nor the Parent will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless (and subject to the other terms of the Indenture):

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not the Parent or the Issuer,
as applicable) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction and
the Successor Company (if not the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) will expressly assume (subject in
each case to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles), (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) to the
extent required by applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Parent or the Issuer, as
applicable, under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Transaction Security Documents;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) only in case of a transaction involving the Parent, immediately after giving effect to such transaction,
either (a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended
four full trading quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the

232


-----

date on which such transaction is consummated would not be lower than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Parent shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) complies with the Indenture, and that all conditions
precedent provided for therein relating to such transaction have been complied with or satisfied, and that
the assumption (if any) of obligations under clause (1) above constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Successor Company. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s
Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent, which properties and assets,
if held by the Parent instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Parent, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Parent under the Indenture and the Notes but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—Subsidiary
_Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may_
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent
and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into
or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the preceding
clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Parent may consolidate
or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Parent, reincorporating the Parent in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Parent.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant) will
not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Parent has complied with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as
a Restricted Subsidiary.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor may (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement):

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless

(A) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes (in each case, subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed
Security Principles) all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and, to the

233


-----

extent required by applicable law to effect such assumption, the obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security
Documents to which it is a party, in each case, subject to any limitation contemplated by the
Agreed Security Principles; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default
has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B) and the provisions described under “—The Issuer and the Parent”
(which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor
and (b) if there is more than one Subsidiary Guarantor, any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of their respective properties and assets to any other Subsidiary
Guarantor, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the
transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or
merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Subsidiary
Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing
until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral” and the_
provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—
_The Issuer and the Parent,” (together, the “Suspended Covenants”) and, in each case, any related default_
provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of
the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been
in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason
of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Parent’s option, as having been
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of
the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant, to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted
to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the
Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date. To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so
permitted to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified_
as permitted under sub-clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

In addition, on the Reversion Date, (1) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to
an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions” and (2) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action_
described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the continuance of the_
Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to sub-clause 1(d) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”

234


-----

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such
notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the Suspended Covenants. The Trustee shall not be
obliged to notify Holders of any Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants shall be reinstated on and from the Reversion Date, no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture with respect to the Suspended
Covenants, and none of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events
occurring during the continuance of the Suspension Event, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising during the continuance of the Suspension Event, in each case, as a result of a failure
to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the continuance of the

Suspension Event (or, upon termination of the Suspension Event or after that time based solely on any action
taken or event that occurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event), and following a Reversion Date,
the Parent and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to
honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during the
continuance of any Suspension Event to the extent that such contractual commitments or obligations are permitted
or not prohibited under the Indenture, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

**_Limited Condition Transaction_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or determining compliance with
any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments and
Restricted Payments), in each case, at the option of the Parent (the Parent’s election to exercise such option, an
“LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such
action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including
as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the
date (the “LCT Test Date”) that the definitive documentation for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered
into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a binding offer, a “certain funds” tender offer, an irrevocable notice,
a declaration of a Restricted Payment or a similar event), and if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited
Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the
incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the
incurrence of Liens, repayments and Restricted Payments) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions
on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and
conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been
complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness
is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided that (a) if financial
statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Parent may elect, in its sole
discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case,
such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such
ratios, tests or baskets, and (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing sub-paragraph (a), compliance with such
ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time
after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related
thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments and Restricted Payments).

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Parent has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for
which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date
have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio,
test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent or the Person subject to such
Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed
to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction
was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been
complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such
requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such
Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the
availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited
Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such

235


-----

Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the Definitive Agreement or date for redemption,
purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated,
expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio,
test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction.

**_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors or the
Issuer, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Revolving Facilities Agreement (or other
Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”), any Public Debt and any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof or any other_
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor exceeding £20.0 million in principal amount, in whole or in part unless,
in each case, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee is
Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to
the Indenture or other appropriate agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a
Guarantee on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture, which Guarantee will be senior to
or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Guarantee.

Following the provision of any additional Guarantees as described above, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (if such security is being
granted in respect of the other Indebtedness), any such Guarantor will provide security over certain of its material
assets (excluding any assets of such Guarantor which are subject to a Permitted Lien at the time of the execution
of such supplemental indenture if providing such security interest would not be permitted by the terms of such
Permitted Lien or by the terms of any obligations secured by such Permitted Lien) to secure its Guarantee on a
first priority basis consistent with the security agreements related to the existing Collateral.

Each additional Guarantee or security will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the Parent will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could
or the grant of such security would be inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security
Principles.

The Parent shall ensure that, subject to the following paragraph and the Agreed Security Principles, the Guarantor
Coverage Threshold is satisfied when tested by reference to the annual report delivered pursuant to the Indenture
(the “Annual Financial Statements”).

The Parent shall ensure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if as at the date of delivery of the Annual
Financial Statements for any financial year, the Guarantor Coverage Threshold is not satisfied, within 60 days of
the delivery of those Annual Financial Statements each Material Company that is not already a Guarantor (together
with such other members of the Group as is necessary) shall accede as Additional Guarantors to ensure that the
Guarantor Coverage Threshold is satisfied (calculated as if such Additional Guarantors had been Guarantors on
the relevant test date and provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Guarantor Coverage Threshold is
satisfied within such time period, no Default or other breach of this Agreement shall arise in respect thereof).
Each such acceding Material Company and member of the Group shall grant Security in favour of the Security
Agent over its material assets in accordance with this covenant and subject to and on terms consistent with the
Agreed Security Principles.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any action, which action would have
the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the

236


-----

Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the
Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant
entitled “—Limitation on Liens;” provided that the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over
any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted
Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited
by the Indenture, the applicable Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in
accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the foregoing, the Transaction Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or released to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto
that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that (except where permitted
by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens
for the benefit of the Security Agent and the holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the
Indenture) no Transaction Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise
modified or released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement or
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets), the Parent delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor
or appraiser or investment bank which confirms the solvency of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification
or release, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the Person
granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of opinion
of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification
or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the
Lien or Liens created under the Transaction Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release and replacement
and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject. In the event that the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause
to be paid any fee to or on behalf of any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of
any of the terms of the provision of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid to
all Holders of the Notes (or relevant series of the Notes, if a consent is only sought in respect of such series) that
consent, waive or agree in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver
or amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted
to exclude Holders where in its good faith determination there is a bona fide regulatory restriction which would
impose a material and burdensome cost on the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, including through the
filing of registration documents under applicable securities laws.

**_Further Assurances_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will, at their own expense,
execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require
(i) for registering any Transaction Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting

237


-----

the security intended to be afforded by such Transaction Security Documents and (ii) if such Transaction Security
Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are
subject to such Transaction Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and
discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. Subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments
and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and
directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.

**_Platinum Group_**

The Parent will procure that, upon the disposition of the equity interests in the Platinum Group to an entity that is
not the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale, for the avoidance of doubt of doubt
after repayment of any Indebtedness secured on the assets of the Platinum Group, will be returned to the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary.

The Parent will procure that neither it nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall become debtors on Indebtedness
owed to any member of the Platinum Group, except for any claims that may arise in respect of receivables arising
in the course of ordinary trading.

The Parent will procure that no member of the Platinum Group will Incur any Indebtedness to a Sponsor Affiliate,
except for Platinum Interim Funding.

The Parent will procure that no member of the Platinum Group will make any Asset Disposition to a Sponsor
Affiliate.

The Parent shall procure that no member of the Platinum Group shall accept any Investment from the Sponsor
Affiliate, other than any Platinum Interim Funding.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders
of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s obligations
under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above or the obligations of the Parent and
the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” above (in each
case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2)
above);

(4) failure to comply by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice by
the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes with the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, Indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
provision”);

238


-----

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates £30.0 million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Parent or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer, the Parent, a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
£30.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability
for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Transaction Security Documents on any material Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of £30.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security
interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or such Transaction Security Document or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable in a final non-appealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(9) any Note Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture), or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Note Guarantee in writing, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of the Note
Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Parent
of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7), the Parent does not cure such default (or arranges
for such default to be cured) within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Parent, or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes by written notice to the Parent and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any,
on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration
of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) of this “Events of Default” section
has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default
shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the
Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to (i) nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest, or Additional Amounts, if any and (ii) a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be

239


-----

modified or amended without the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, each of which may only be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of
prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the offer of security
and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide
that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a
prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights
of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is
informed of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 90
days after being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium,
if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of
the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is required
to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each trading year, a certificate signed by an authorized
representative of the Parent indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written
notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and
what action the Parent is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not
be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances
the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

240

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject
to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes); provided that (i) if any
amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required and (ii) if any
amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, waive or modify one or more series of the Notes, only
the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the relevant series (and not the
consent of at least a majority of all Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, shall be required. However,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then
outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), an amendment or waiver may not, and may not have
the effect of, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption” or “—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons;”_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment of principal or interest on or
with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Additional Amounts” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of
such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under their respective Note
Guarantees or the Indenture, except otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the material Collateral, other than
pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Security Document or the Indenture, as applicable, except as
permitted by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent holding not
less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of
such Notes, or amend or waive the provisions described under “Payments for Consent;” or

(12) alter the ranking of the Notes in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement adversely to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the
other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

241


-----

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision of the Note
Documents to the “Description of the Notes” contained in an Offering Memorandum, (to the extent such
amendment or supplement is in respect of Note Documents for a new series of Notes without affecting
the Note Documents for Notes already in issue), or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under
any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a
manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code) or change
the minimum denominations for the Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or does
not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral” to add Note Guarantees, add security to or for the benefit_
of the Notes, or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Transaction Security Documents) or any amendment
in respect thereon with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking or amendment is permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;
or

(9) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Revolving Facilities Agreement,
and the Second Lien Facilities Agreement in any property which is required by the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, the Sponsor Subordinated Loan Agreement and the Second Lien Facilities Agreement (in
each case, as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security
interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security
interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited
by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” is complied with._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in connection with
a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any amendment, supplement and waiver.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred in
any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled,
or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not
to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations,
including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of
the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary
Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Transaction Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent” and the covenant described under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and the default_
provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross
default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions, the judgment default
provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of Default”
above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
the covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—_
_Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (other than with respect to the Issuer and the_
Parent), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) (i) with
respect to the Notes denominated in pound sterling, cash in pound sterling, UK Government Obligations, or a
combination of cash in pound sterling and UK Government Obligations and (ii) with respect to the Notes
denominated in euro, cash in euro, euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination of cash
in euro and euro-denominated European Government Obligations, in each case, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent, for the payment
of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must
comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance
only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

243

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Document will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes and certain rights of the
Trustee, each as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the
Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes
for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer)
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within
one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2)
the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed
as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), (i) with respect to the Notes denominated in pound sterling, cash in
pound sterling, UK Government Obligations or a combination of cash in pound sterling and UK Government
Obligations and (ii) with respect to the Notes denominated in euro, cash in euro, euro-denominated European
Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in euro and euro-denominated European Government
Obligations, in each case, in an amount sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent to pay and discharge the outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness on the
Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the
date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture;
and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect
that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on
any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and
(3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or the Parent, any of the Parent’s
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer
or the Guarantors under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver
and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as the Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written
notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee
to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture is not to be construed as an obligation or
duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions with the Parent, the Issuer and
their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by giving notice to the Trustee and the Issuer, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict
of interest in its capacity as Trustee that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes
insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder

244


-----

for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the
Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, if and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the
Exchange of any notices with respect to the Notes. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all
notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph, for further transmission to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail, cause to be delivered or otherwise transmit a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect
in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed or
delivered in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes or any
Note Guarantee will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable
due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

The currency in which any series of Notes hereunder is issued (the “Relevant Currency”) is the sole currency of
account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with such series
of Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered
in a currency other than the Relevant Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order
of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the Relevant Currency amount
which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date
of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which
it is practicable to do so).

If that Relevant Currency amount is less than the Relevant Currency amount expressed to be due to the recipient
or the Trustee under any series of Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of
information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other
than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterlingdenominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a

245


-----

currency other than pound sterling shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date such non-pound sterling amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are held or located outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment
of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase
price with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes and
the Note Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York,
United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to
the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of
Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the date of such redemption notice to July

of acquisition (or, if later, from the relevant date of calculation under the Indenture);

(2) certificates of deposit, time deposits, eurodollar time deposits, overnight bank deposits or bankers’

by Moody’s (or if at the time neither is issuing comparable ratings, then a comparable rating of another

does not have commercial paper which is rated) having combined capital and surplus in excess of £500
million;

that for the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Financial Interest Expense for such
period, if, as of such date of determination:

(1) since the beginning of such period, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has closed or disposed of any
company, any business or site, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business or site
(any such disposition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is such a Sale, (a) Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be reduced by an amount
equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such
Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative)
attributable thereto for such period; provided that if any such Sale constitutes “discontinued operations”
in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net Income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to such operations for such period or increased by an
amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if negative) attributable thereto for such period; and (b)
the Consolidated Financial Interest Expense for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Consolidated Financial Interest Expense directly attributable to any Indebtedness of the Parent or of any
Restricted Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Parent
and the continuing Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such Asset Disposition for such same
period (or, if the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary is sold, the Consolidated Financial Interest
Expense for such period directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary to the
extent the Parent and the continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness
after such Sale);

(2) since the beginning of such period, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) has
made an Investment in any Person that thereby becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or otherwise has
acquired any company, any business or site, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a

business or site, or made a capital investment for the refurbishment of a site or converted the operating
model of a site (including, but not limited to, a conversion from a leased and/or tenanted model to a
managed model) (any such Investment or acquisition, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase
occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated
EBITDA and Consolidated Financial Interest Expense for such period will be calculated after giving pro
forma effect thereto, as if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period pro forma effect thereto
as if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period;

(3) since the beginning of such period, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has made or implemented a
Specified Transaction or Group Initiative, including any such Specified Transaction or Group Initiative
occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated
EBITDA and Consolidated Financial Interest Expense for such period will be calculated after giving pro
forma effect thereto, including anticipated synergies and cost savings as Specified Transaction or Group
Initiative occurred on the first day of such period; and

(4) since the beginning of such period, any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or
otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of
such period) will have made any Sale, Purchase, Specified Transaction or Group Initiative that would
have required an adjustment pursuant to clauses (1), (2) or (3) above if made by the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary since the beginning of such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Financial
Interest Expense for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale
or Purchase occurred on the first day of such period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest expense on
such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable
rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness for a period
equal to the remaining term of such Indebtedness).

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Financial Interest
Expense, Consolidated Income Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and
Consolidated Net Income, to the extent applicable and without duplication, (i) calculations will be as determined
in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent (including in respect of anticipated
synergies and expense and cost reductions, and as though the full effect of synergies and expense and cost
reductions were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated
full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer
of the Parent) of any Group Initiatives that have been initiated or implemented by the Parent or its Restricted
Subsidiaries during the relevant period or in connection with an event specified in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above as
though such Group Initiative had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant period), (ii) in determining
the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect shall be given to any
Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if
such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period, (iii) pro forma effect shall be given to
anticipated acquisitions which have become subject to Definitive Agreements, (iv) calculations shall also give pro
forma effect to any Specified Transaction that has occurred since the beginning of such period but which has not
yet been fully reflected in the relevant period (as determined and calculated by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Parent), (v) calculations shall exclude any non-recurring costs and other expenses arising
directly or indirectly as a consequence of any Sale or Purchase or Specified Transaction and/or the implementation
of any Group Initiative, (vi) “determined on a consolidated basis on the basis of IFRS,” “determined on the basis
of IFRS” and similar provisions shall at the election of the Parent allow for calculation to be made on the basis of
presentation of the financial statements provided pursuant to the terms of the covenant described under “—Certain

commitments under a revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Leverage or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, for borrowings and
reborrowing thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will, at the Parent’s option as elected on the date the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, enters into or increases such commitments, either (x) be determined on the date of such revolving credit
facility, such letter of credit facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has
been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Leverage or Consolidated
EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)

Consolidated EBITDA, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of

reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the
operation of this sub-paragraph (x) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Leverage or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as
applicable, and for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (only for purposes of
testing incurrence of the Reserved Indebtedness Amount), Consolidated Leverage or Consolidated EBITDAbased permission (only for the purpose of calculation of the relevant permission), as applicable, the Reserved
Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for
so long as such commitments are outstanding or (y) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant
to any such facility or increased commitment.

savings for any period taken into account for any calculation in connection with any Sale, Purchase, Specified

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
**Global Note”). Each series of Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the United States**
in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the **Rule 144A**
**Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with a common**
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule
144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by
Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Sterling Notes will be issued in registered, global form in
minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof and the Euro Notes will
be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of €100,000 100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require
that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes
are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not
receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of
the Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder(s) of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the
Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of our or their respective
agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in
respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in
the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be issued
Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the

282


-----

restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable
law.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable
for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration
from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the
Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book- Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and
Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We
understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis
(with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided,
however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 with respect to the Sterling Notes or €100,000 with
respect to the Euro Notes in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if
any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent for onward payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except
as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such
deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts_
received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding
to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note
or Book- Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing
customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will
treat the registered holder(s) of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its
nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of us, the Trustee or any of their agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

283


-----

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
in respect of the Sterling Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Sterling Notes through Euroclear or
Clearstream in pound sterling.

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
in respect of the Euro Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Euro Notes through Euroclear or
Clearstream in euros.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default
under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the right to exchange
the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their
participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s or
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require
physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in
the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry**
**Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.**

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in
accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation
S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book- Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described in the Indenture and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first

284


-----

mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and
may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
or the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities
for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their
participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear
and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the
Authority is expected to grant permission for the listing of and permission to deal in the Offered Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of us, any guarantor, the Trustee or our or their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Sterling Notes will be made in pound sterling and initial settlement for the Euro Notes
will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the
settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited
to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can
be made on the desired value date.

285

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax consequences of
purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile,
including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a
comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell
Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you.
The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as
in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

**Certain UK Taxation Considerations**

The comments below are of a general nature and are not intended to be an exhaustive summary of all UK tax
considerations relating to the Notes. They relate only to certain aspects of UK tax law, and in particular do not
address the UK tax consequences of disposing of the Notes. They are based on current UK tax law as applied in
England and Wales and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice (which may not be binding on
HMRC), both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. They do not address the
consequences of any substitution of the Issuer or further issues of securities that will form a single series with the
Notes (notwithstanding that such substitution or further issue may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the
Notes). They do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other
person. The UK tax treatment of prospective holders of Notes depends on their individual circumstances and may
be subject to change in the future. The comments below relate only to the position of persons who are the absolute
beneficial owners of Notes and any interest payable on their Notes and who hold Notes as a capital investment.
Certain classes of persons (such as brokers, dealers, certain professional investors or persons connected with the
Issuer) may be subject to special rules and the comments below do not apply to such holders of the Notes. The
comments below do not purport to constitute legal or tax advice. Any prospective holders of Notes who are in
doubt as to their own tax position, or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the UK, should consult
their own professional advisors.

**_Payments of Interest by the Issuer_**

_Withholding Tax_

If and while the Notes continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005
of the Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest by the Issuer on the Notes may be made without withholding
or deduction for or on account of UK income tax. The Exchange is a “recognised stock exchange” for these
purposes. The Notes will be treated for these purposes as listed on the Exchange where they are admitted to trading
on the Exchange and are officially listed in Guernsey in accordance with provisions corresponding to those
generally applicable in EEA states.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax
where the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes at the
time the payment is made that (i) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a UK resident company, (ii) the
person beneficially entitled to the interest is a non-UK resident company that carries on a trade in the UK through
a permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-UK resident company is required to bring into
account when calculating its profits subject to UK corporation tax or (iii) the person to whom the payment is made
is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out in Sections 935-937
of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that in each case HMRC has not given a direction, the effect of which is
that the payment may not be made without that withholding or deduction.

If the Notes are not, or cease to be, listed on a “recognised stock exchange”, interest will generally be paid by the
Issuer under deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), unless (i) another exemption applies
or (ii) the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HMRC in respect of such relief as may be available
pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty. If interest were paid under deduction of UK
income tax, holders of the Notes who are not resident in the UK may be able to recover all or part of the tax
deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty.

Any premium payable on redemption of the Notes may be treated as a payment of interest for UK tax purposes
and may accordingly be subject to the UK withholding tax treatment described above.

286


-----

**_Direct Assessment_**

The interest and premium (if any) on the Notes is expected to have a UK source for tax purposes and accordingly
may be chargeable to UK tax by direct assessment (including self- assessment) even where paid without
withholding or deduction. However, interest and premium (if any) paid without withholding or deduction for or
on account of UK income tax will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of holders (other than certain trustees)
who are not resident for tax purposes in the UK, except where (a) the holder of the Notes carries on a trade,
profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency, or in the case of a corporate holder, carries on a
trade through a permanent establishment in the UK, and (b) the interest and premium (if any) is received in
connection with or the Notes are attributable to, that branch, agency or permanent establishment in which case
(subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent) tax may be levied on the UK branch or
agency, or permanent establishment.

Holders of the Notes should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in “Description of
_the Notes—Additional Amounts” above would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to_
the relevant interest and premium (if any) to UK tax. However exemption from, or reduction of, such United
Kingdom tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty.

**_Payments Under a Note Guarantee_**

The UK withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor under the terms of a Note Guarantee in respect of
interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for
the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemption from
withholding for or on account of UK tax in respect of securities listed on a “recognised stock exchange” described
above in relation to payments of interest by the Issuer. Accordingly, if a Guarantor makes any such payments and
they have a UK source, these may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%).

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)_**

No UK stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue of the Notes, or on a transfer of the Notes assuming that (i)
the interest on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the Notes and
(ii) any right on repayment of the Notes to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the Notes is reasonably
comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms
of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.

**_Information Reporting_**

HMRC has powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Notes, including in relation to issues of
and other transactions in the Notes, interest, payments treated as interest and other payments derived from the
Notes. This may include the value of the Notes, details of the beneficial owners of the Notes, of the person for
whom the Notes are held and of the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid.
Information may be obtained from a range of persons including persons who effect or are a party to such
transactions on behalf of others, registrars and administrators of such transactions, the registered holders of the
Notes, persons who make, receive or are entitled to receive payments derived from the Notes and persons by or
through whom interest and payments treated as interest are paid or credited. Information obtained by HMRC may,
in certain circumstances, be exchanged by HMRC with the tax authorities of other jurisdictions.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes as of the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this summary deals only with the
Offered Sterling Notes and the Offered Euro Notes as defined in the Offering Memorandum. This summary deals
only with the Notes that are held as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes by a U.S. holder
(as defined below) who acquires the Notes upon original issuance at their initial offering price. As used herein, a
“U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of
the following:

  - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

287


-----

  - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or

  - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid
election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be
treated as a United States person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from
those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation and
does not address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or state, local, non-United
States or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In
addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For
example, this summary does not address:

  - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as brokers or dealers in
securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting
for their securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes (or an investor
in such entity), tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

  - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or a straddle;

  - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar; or

  - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any.

If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the Notes, you should consult your
tax advisors.

If you are considering the purchase of the Notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular
United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as
well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note will generally be taxable to you as
ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for United States
federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld), you
will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may
be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election
to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). You will
generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet
a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. Interest income
(including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes
of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. However, recently
issued Treasury regulations (the “Foreign Tax Credit Regulations”) impose additional requirements for foreign
tax to be eligible for a foreign tax credit, and there can be no assurance that those requirements will be satisfied.
A recent notice from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) indicates that the IRS is considering proposing
amendments to the Foreign Tax Credit Regulations and also allows taxpayers to defer the application of many
aspects of the Foreign Tax Credit Regulations until further notice. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are
complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your
particular circumstances.

288


-----

Interest on the Sterling Notes will be payable in pound sterling and interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in
euro. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be
required to include in income the United States dollar value of the interest received, determined by translating the
foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into United States dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the
receipt of such payment.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine
the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest (including any additional amounts) in accordance
with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable
year the United States dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating
such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in
the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable
year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

  - the last day of the accrual period,

  - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or

  - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual
period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt obligations you
hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the United States Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”). You should consult your tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.

In addition, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of
proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you
will recognize United States source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the amount received at the spot rate on
the date such payment is received) and the United States dollar value of the interest income you previously
included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above).

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement and Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, you will recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest
income to the extent not previously included in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note. Your adjusted
tax basis in the Note generally will be your United States dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note
with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the United States dollar value of the foreign currency paid for
such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed,
retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for foreign currency, the amount realized generally will
be the United States dollar value of the foreign currency received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the
Notes are traded on an established securities market, foreign currency paid or received will be translated into
United States dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual method
taxpayer, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of the Notes traded on an
established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year
to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including
individuals, derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of
taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note would generally be treated as United
States source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a
Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source

289


-----

gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated
in foreign currency on the date of purchase and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the
difference between (i) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the United States dollar value
of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or
electing accrual basis U.S. holders, the settlement date of such disposition and/or purchase, provided the Note is
traded on an established securities market). The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of a
Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss
realized on the disposition of the Note.

**_Exchange Gain or Loss with respect to Foreign Currency_**

Your tax basis in the foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be equal to the United States dollar value of the foreign
currency, determined at the time of receipt. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other
taxable disposition of the foreign currency will be ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States
source gain or loss.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue additional Notes under the Indenture. Even if these additional Notes are treated as part of
the same series as the Notes for non-tax purposes, in some cases they may be treated as a separate series for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. For instance, additional notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may
be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable
series of notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to
Regulation S, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the
potential issuance of additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial notes issued under
the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately
identified.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover
transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the
Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note,
such as a Note, or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note, to the extent that such sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount.
If you are considering the purchase of the Notes, you should consult with your tax advisors to determine the tax
return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form
8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of principal and interest on a Note, or
the proceeds from the sale of a Note, unless you are an exempt recipient. Additionally, if you fail to provide your
taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments fail either to report in full dividend and interest
income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be

**Certain Cayman Islands Taxation Considerations**

The comments below are of a general nature based on Cayman Islands laws presently in effect and are not intended
to be exhaustive. This is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s particular circumstances, and
does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law.

**_The Notes_**

Under current Cayman Islands laws:

- payments of interest and principal on the Notes will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and
no withholding will be required on the payment of interest and principal to any holder of the Notes, nor
will gains derived from the disposal of the Notes be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation
tax. The Cayman Islands currently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no estate duty,
inheritance tax or gift tax;

- no stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue or transfer of the Notes, although Cayman Islands stamp
duty shall be payable if Notes are executed in or brought into, or produced before a court of, the Cayman
Islands; and

- certificates evidencing the Notes, in registered form, to which title is not transferable by delivery, should
not attract Cayman Islands stamp duty (provided such certificates are not executed in, or brought into, or
produced before a court of, the Cayman Islands); however, an instrument transferring title to a Note, if
brought to or executed in, or produced before a court of, the Cayman Islands, would be subject to nominal
Cayman Islands stamp duty.

**_Payments Under a Guarantee_**

Under current Cayman Islands laws, payments made under the terms of a guarantee by a Cayman Islands guarantor
will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on any such payments.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND**
**SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_the Collateral in the jurisdiction in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are organized as well as a general_
_discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by these laws for informational purposes only._

_This summary does not address all legal considerations that may be relevant to holders and it does not purport_
_to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability_
_of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral. Bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings could be initiated in_
_any of the jurisdictions of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws_
_in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely_
_affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and_
_the Collateral._

_Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**Cayman Islands**

Certain of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral are exempted companies incorporated under the laws of the
Cayman Islands (the “Cayman Obligors”). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Cayman
Obligors would likely be based on Cayman Islands insolvency laws. However, it is possible that the courts of
other places may seek to assert jurisdiction over the Cayman Obligors for the purpose of insolvency or
restructuring proceedings (either as well as, or instead of, insolvency proceedings in the Cayman Islands).

In the case of a winding up of a Cayman Islands company in a jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands, the
priority of any security granted by or over the assets of that Cayman Islands company may be affected by any
provision of the laws of that jurisdiction as to the priority of claims in a winding-up.

**_Winding up of a Cayman Islands company and insolvency considerations_**

Cayman Islands insolvency law provides for three different systems for winding up companies, namely
(i) winding-up by order of the court; (ii) voluntary winding-up and (iii) voluntary winding-up which becomes
subject to the supervision of the court and then proceeds in the same manner as a winding-up by order of the court.
Each system requires the appointment of a liquidator, who assumes control of the company and whose function it
is to collect, realize and distribute the assets of the company to its creditors in accordance with the statutory order
of priority and thereafter (in the case of a solvent company) to distribute any surplus among the company’s
shareholders.

Generally speaking as a matter of Cayman Islands law, contracts to which a Cayman Islands company is a party
are not automatically terminated and nor is the counterparty released from its obligations, by the company’s entry
into liquidation. The question of whether, as a contractual matter, the commencement of a liquidation has any
effect on the parties’ contractual obligations will fall to be determined according to the governing law of each
contract to which the company is a party. The liquidator of a Cayman Islands company has no statutory right to
disclaim onerous contracts.

A petition to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Court”) for a winding-up order may be presented by
the company itself or by a creditor or shareholder of the company. One of the grounds upon which a winding-up
order may be sought is that the company is unable to pay its debts as defined in Section 93 of the Cayman Islands
Companies Act (As Revised) (the “Cayman **Companies Act”). The test for insolvency in the Cayman Islands is**
a cash flow test which includes an element of futurity (although how into the future the Court will look is highly
fact specific).

When a winding-up order is made by the Court or a voluntary winding-up is continued under the supervision of
the Court (i.e., in an official liquidation), an automatic moratorium on litigation against the company is imposed
pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Cayman Companies Act—that is, proceedings (other than criminal proceedings)
may not be commenced or continued against the company without the permission of the Court. Pursuant to
Section 99 of the Cayman Companies Act, dispositions of property, transfers of shares and alterations in the status
of shareholders after the date of presentation of the winding-up petition are void, unless the Court orders otherwise.
The moratorium does not prevent a secured creditor from realizing its security as set out below, nor does it affect
any valid contractual subordination rights, or rights of set off or netting of claims which were granted before the
commencement of the official liquidation. Section 96 of the Cayman Companies Act provides that at any time

292


-----

following the presentation of the petition for the winding up of a company and before the making of a winding up
order where proceedings are pending in a summary court, the Grand Court, the Cayman Islands Court of Appeal
or the Privy Council or in a foreign court, the company or any creditor or contributory may apply to the relevant
court for an order staying the proceedings or, in the case of a foreign court, for an injunction to restrain further
proceedings on such terms as the court thinks fit. In practice, in so far as it concerns domestic proceedings, the
scope and effect of any stay granted under section 96 is the same as section 97. It would be a matter for the foreign
court to determine whether to grant an injunction to restrain further proceedings against a Cayman Islands
incorporated company in that court.

It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors
are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule. This rule
applies to the claims of ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as at the date of the
commencement of the winding up of the company, or whose claims arise out of causes of action that accrued
before the commencement of the winding up. Subject to certain exceptions, when a winding up order is made, the
winding up is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of a winding-up petition. Generally
speaking, a creditor having a validly created security interest over property of a company in liquidation is entitled
to enforce their security in accordance with its terms without reference to the official liquidators and without the
leave of the Court pursuant to section 142(1) of the Cayman Companies Act. The official liquidator may also,
with the agreement of the secured creditor, realize the secured asset for the benefit of the secured creditor, and
deduct their remuneration in connection with the sale from the sale proceeds (in accordance with section 142(2)
of the Cayman Companies Act).

The claims of secured creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured creditors and secured
creditors holding security in the nature of a floating charge. All costs, charges and expenses properly incurred in
the winding up of the company, including the remuneration of the liquidators, are payable out of the assets of the
company in priority to unsecured claims.

An official liquidator must be a qualified insolvency practitioner who meets independence, insurance and
residence requirements (and as such a foreign receiver or liquidator may not act as the sole liquidator of a Cayman
Islands company). A liquidator is an officer of the Court and has fiduciary duties to the company to act in good
faith, for a proper purpose and for the benefit of the company at all times.

A voluntary liquidation is most commonly instituted by way of special resolution of the voting shareholders of
the company. There is no automatic moratorium on litigation against the company in a voluntary liquidation and
no equivalent to Section 99 of the Cayman Companies Act; although Section 125 of the Cayman Companies Act
provides that a transfer of shares or alteration in the status of shareholders made after the commencement of the
voluntary liquidation is void unless sanctioned by the liquidator. As with an official liquidation, a voluntary
liquidation does not prevent a secured creditor from enforcing their security in accordance with its terms. There
are no restrictions on who may act as the voluntary liquidator of a Cayman Islands company.

If, within 28 days of the commencement of the voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company do not provide
a declaration of solvency to the liquidator (which is then filed with the Registrar of Companies), the voluntary
liquidator is obliged by law to apply to the Court for a supervision order. The practical effect of this is that, upon
a supervision order being made, the voluntary liquidation proceeds as if it were an official liquidation in all
respects. This could lead to increased costs of the liquidation since, among other things, the liquidator will be
obliged to provide the Court and the stakeholders with regular reports detailing the assets and liabilities of the
company and all of the steps taken in the liquidation to date. A declaration of solvency takes into account the
ability of the company to pay its debts within a period of twelve months of the declaration being made. Even if
the directors do provide such a declaration, a voluntary liquidator may still apply to the Court for supervision in
circumstances where he thinks that such an order will facilitate a more effective, economic or expeditious
liquidation of the company in the interests of its stakeholders.

**_Restructuring Officer_**

Cayman Islands insolvency law also provides a regime pursuant to which a company that (i) is or is likely to
become insolvent (applying the same test, outlined above, of inability to pay debts), and (ii) intends to present a
compromise or arrangement to its creditors, can petition the court for the appointment of a Restructuring Officer.
A company’s board is given statutory power to file such a petition without shareholder pre-approval or a specific
power to do so in the company’s articles of association. Upon filing of a petition for the appointment of a
Restructuring Officer, and pending the hearing of that petition, the Companies Act creates an automatic stay on
all creditor action and shareholder power to resolve to wind up the company. That stay purportedly applies extra
293


-----

territorially. If a Restructuring Officer is appointed by the court, the compromise or arrangement with creditors is
promoted within those proceedings. In the event that creditors reject the proposal and the company remains
insolvent, a creditor or creditors may seek the winding up of the company, if the company does not move to
appoint liquidators itself.

**_Challenges to Note Guarantees and Collateral_**

There are circumstances under Cayman Islands insolvency law in which the granting by a Cayman Islands
company of security and guarantees may be challenged either by an official liquidator of such Cayman Islands
company or by a creditor claiming to have been prejudiced by such grants.

The following paragraphs discuss potential grounds for challenge that may apply to guarantee and security
interests granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, as referred to above, under Section 99 of the
Cayman Companies Act, any disposition of the company’s property made after the commencement of an official
liquidation is, unless sanctioned by the court, void.

_Fraudulent dispositions_

Under section 146 of the Cayman Companies Act, if a company goes into liquidation and it has disposed of its
property at an undervalue with the intent to defraud its creditors, the Court may, on the application of the
liquidator, set the disposition aside.

A disposition will constitute a disposition at an undervalue if the disposition is on terms that provide for the
company to receive no consideration or a disposition for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s
worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the property which is the subject of the
disposition.

The liquidator must show that there was “intent to defraud” a creditor, meaning an intention to wilfully defeat an
obligation owed to a creditor. Unlike with voidable preferences as outlined below, there is no requirement to show
insolvency at the time of the disposition (however, it is unlikely that any creditors will be prejudiced by any such
disposition unless the company is insolvent).

Under section 4 of the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (“Fraudulent
**Dispositions Act”), a disposition of property made with an intent to defraud (again defined as an intention of a**
transferor wilfully to defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) and at an undervalue is voidable at the instance of a
creditor thereby prejudiced.

Under both the Cayman Companies Act and the Fraudulent Dispositions Act, an application to set aside a
disposition must be made within six years of the date of the disposition.

_Voidable preferences_

If, within six months before the commencement of the winding up of a company, at a time when it cannot pay its
debts, the company makes a payment, or transfers or charges any of its property, or takes or suffers any judicial
proceedings, in favor of any of its creditors with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors
of the company, the transaction will be voidable upon the application of the liquidator. This is the effect of
section 145 of the Cayman Companies Act.

The essence of a voidable preference is that the company, knowing that it cannot pay all its debts in full, voluntarily
and improperly makes a payment or gives a benefit to one creditor which results in an inequality between the
creditor and the company’s other creditors. A transaction will only be set aside as a voidable preference if the
company’s act was undertaken voluntarily, with a dominant intention to prefer the creditor (Cayman Islands law
imposes a subjective test) and the company was insolvent at the time the payment was made. Additionally, in this
context, a payment made to a related party of the company will be deemed to have been made with a view to
giving that creditor a preference.

Pursuant to section 147 of the Cayman Companies Act, if in the course of the winding up of a company it appears
that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors
of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the liquidator may apply to the Court for a declaration that any
persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of such business are liable to make such contributions to
the company’s assets as the Court thinks proper.

294


-----

_Orders_

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required, the court has very wide statutory
powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was
entered into.

_Common law remedies_

Depending on the circumstances, in addition to the above statutory provisions the Court may effectively reverse
certain antecedent transactions based on common law and/or equitable principles. For example, in the event a
transaction amounts to a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties, and if a person knowingly receives the
company’s property as a result of that breach in circumstances where it would be unconscionable for them to
retain the property, the Court may order that this property is being held on constructive trust for the company. The
application of these principles can be complex and highly fact-sensitive.

There is no statutory provision dealing directly with insolvent trading in the Cayman Islands. Directors may be
liable for breach of their fiduciary obligations, however, if the company continues to incur liabilities to the
prejudice of the company’s creditors at a time when there is no reasonable prospect of the company trading out of
its financial difficulties.

**_Financial assistance_**

Under Cayman Islands law there is no statutory or common law rule which prohibits a company from giving
financial assistance to any person for the acquisition of the company’s shares. The directors of the company must
ensure the transaction is in the best interests of the company and is carried out on a proper commercial basis,
otherwise the transaction may be impugned on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty. On this basis it can be
worthwhile obtaining a shareholder resolution to approve any such assistance.

**_Limitation on enforcement against a Cayman Islands company—schemes of arrangements_**

Enforcement against a Cayman Islands company may be limited by section 86 or section 91I of the Cayman
Companies Act which provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any
class of them shall, if sanctioned by the Court, be binding on all the creditors or a class of creditors. Each class of
creditors will be bound by the scheme if a majority in number representing 75% in value of each class who
attended (whether in person or by proxy) and voted at the relevant scheme meeting(s), approved the scheme and
the scheme is sanctioned by the Court. Cayman Islands case law suggests that each class of creditor shall comprise
“those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view
to their acting in their common interest.” Two or more creditors are likely to constitute separate classes in a
compromise or arrangement if they hold security over different assets or hold security over the same asset but do
not rank equally.

Enforcement may also be limited by the principles of Cayman Islands law relating to the avoidance of transactions
discussed in the section titled “Challenges to Note Guarantees and Collateral” above.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that the Court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be
created by a security document governed by Cayman Islands law properly take effect as floating charges as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will
be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on
whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets
and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the secured party in practice. Where the
chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without
the consent of the secured party, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes
a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are
recharacterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets would be applied as per the order of
priority set out above.

**_Security over shares_**

The most common form of security taken over shares of a Cayman Islands company is an equitable mortgage,
rather than a legal mortgage or legal charge. An equitable mortgage arises where a mortgagor creates an

295


-----

encumbrance over the property in favor of the secured party but the mortgagor retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable mortgages may involve seeking to transfer title to the shares to the secured party
or its nominee and may be subject to equitable considerations.

**England and Wales**

**_United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU_**

Following a national referendum in June 2016, the UK exercised its right pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on
the EU to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020
at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“Exit Day”). As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to Regulation
(EU) 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast **Insolvency Regulation”) as it applies to the UK is to be**
read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of
section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been,
or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by UK domestic law and shall include any
subordinate legislation made from time to time under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA.

On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London
time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a Member State, including for
the purpose of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as
a Member State.

The Recast Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment)
(EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, the
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and paragraph 1, schedule 5, European Union
(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions
regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, providing for
the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, no longer apply. However,
the EUWA provided for the Recast Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency
proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the Recast
Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP
Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to
recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK
insolvency proceedings.

The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU
insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction
that apply under English law, the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency
Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in
respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment
of debt, reorganization or liquidation and:

    - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the UK; or

    - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the
UK.

These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a
debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency
Amendment Regulations extend the English court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a
sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order
is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the
distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any
foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its
COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an
EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration.

While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency
proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent

296


-----

of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of
_English insolvency and restructuring proceedings”)._

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer, certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales (each an “English company”). The courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction
to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company.

In addition, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency
**Regulations”), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”)**
in Great Britain and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in
the world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English)
proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main
proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has
an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a
jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded
recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets
of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an
automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent
certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s
assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security
over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies
upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit a stay may be requested from the English court).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These
include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for
an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed
below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or,
in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving
by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, the granting of future Permitted Collateral Liens
and certain perfection requirements, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis, on the
Issue Date, by the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a
guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on
the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect
investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and
therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the Issuer or a Guarantor.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended, the “Insolvency Act”) and the onshored version of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation (which pursuant to the Insolvency Amendment Regulations has been substantially amended) provide
that an administrator may be appointed (whether in or out of court) in respect of a company incorporated in
England and Wales or Scotland, a company incorporated in an EEA state, a company not incorporated in an EEA
state but with its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark), a company (wherever incorporated) having its
COMI in the UK or a company (wherever incorporated) with its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark)
and an “establishment” in the UK.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order,
an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to
become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of
administration.

297


-----

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall
due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of
its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy
a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a
judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing
the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably
practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property
to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any
distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency”).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of
a “qualifying floating charge” granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an
administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and,
subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the
proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory
order of priority, (see “—Priority on Insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the
court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the
purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging
the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator may also dispose of property of a
company subject to a fixed charge with the consent of the secured creditors.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the
appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security
over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a
demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for
consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings,
execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an
application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration
order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been
filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where
the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days
(where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors).

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize
their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue
of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a
charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and
credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended)
(the “Financial Collateral Regulations”) (see further below).

If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted
by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator
would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment
could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the
company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration,
the Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the
Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without
the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

298


-----

As set out above, the Insolvency Act empowers the English courts to make an administration order in respect of
an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company,
its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become
enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the
floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the
purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the
qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the
exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most
relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to
“capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a
debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital
markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt
instrument as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative receiver has been
appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder
of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the
administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative
receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating
charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any
part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a)
states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative
receiver within the meaning given by Section 29 of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a
qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security
interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one
such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which
apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of
whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the
chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that
are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the
company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there
is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge
realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate
cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020)
(except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating
charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part
must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the
resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court may grant an order on the
application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall
claims of secured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a
prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured
creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as
described in the Financial Collateral Regulations), as set out below.

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges,
see “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges” above) may be appointed over some
or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed
charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925.

299


-----

If appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an
appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator
may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge
that falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial
Collateral Regulations.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he
owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs
his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary
remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to
take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver
will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the
company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from
the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“—Priority on Insolvency”).

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an
administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and, where the floating
charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, use such cash,
or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which include the administrator’s
remuneration and can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in
administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the
date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets (provided the
floating charge had not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and the fixed charge holder has no
notice of any restrictions); (c) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a
security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration)
properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject
of the floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (d) until the floating charge security
crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary
course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give
a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security may be subject to
certain challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Avoidance of Transactions—Grant of Floating Charge”);
and (f) where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral
arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the expenses of the insolvent estate, (ii) subject to the claims
of certain preferential creditors (such as employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday
claims, certain unpaid pension contributions, and VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC) and (iii) as noted
above, subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) for unsecured creditors; (g) an
administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior
consent of the charge holder or court approval but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect
of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an
administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to
promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the
property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce
the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the property at market
value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be
created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the
description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to
be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will
depend on, amongst other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant
chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised
by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported
fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is
likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be
described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

300


-----

If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could
be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder
in insolvency proceedings.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (“CA06”), the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise or arrangement between
a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) in respect of the company’s obligations to those creditors.
An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign
obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to
England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb
of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI
is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in
accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a
number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to
assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of
creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors could be varied).
Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present
case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the
existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given
under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a
majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of
each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the
court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected
creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to
be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all
relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those
entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to
sanction the scheme as approved by the creditors, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or
refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of
Companies (in the case of UK companies, for the purpose of registration). A scheme of arrangement can often
involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order to
ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically
trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangement_**

English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies incorporated
in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA State or with their respective COMI in the UK or a Member State (other
than Denmark).

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which
entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or
reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors
(by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who
were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the
right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also
cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid
on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by
value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of

301


-----

unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted on in a company voluntary arrangement
but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company
voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. A CVA also requires
the approval of more than 50% in value of the company’s members present in person or by proxy and voting at a
meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the outcome of the meeting
of members differs from the outcome of the meeting of creditors, the decision of the creditors will prevail. Like
creditors, members have the right to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary
arrangement in certain circumstances.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a
moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.

**_Filings_**

The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English company purports to create
security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should be delivered to the Registrar of Companies
within 21 days after the date of creation of the security in accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of CA06. While
CA06 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6,
2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable
charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was
intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it
may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant
charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired.

The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral
Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out
in section 859A(6) of CA06): (i) a charge in favor of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection
with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982)
to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from
the application of section 859A of CA06 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from
registration under the Banking Act 2009).

Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a
pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities.

Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not
need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Registration with applicable asset registries may, however,
still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the
legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including
guarantees and security).

**_Assignments_**

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal
assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision,
which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing under the hand of the assignor; (ii) the assignment must be
absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the
underlying obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid
equitable assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations,
including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal
interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the
priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given
to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first to give notice will take
priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration
for his or her interest.

**_PSC Regime_**

302


-----

Pursuant to Part 21A of CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to CA06), certain UK incorporated companies
and limited liability partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a relevant company) must keep a register
of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such
registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the CA06
(for the purposes of this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give
relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B
to CA06. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest
in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to CA06, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i)
any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest;
(iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and
(iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the
interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of the
security interests over the ability of the Security Agent to enforce its rights under the English security documents.

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed
by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the
Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is
dissolved and removed from the Register of Companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory
liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or
creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an
administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the
company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months
(if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an
insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that
while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of
the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors.

The English court has jurisdiction to wind up a company through compulsory liquidation if it is a company
registered in England and Wales, or if it is a foreign company (i) with its COMI in England and Wales, or (ii) with
its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales, or (iii) in the
case of an unregistered foreign company, if (a) it has enough of a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales
to justify the English court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up through compulsory liquidation, (b) there
is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefits to those applying for the winding-up order
and (c) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the
English court can exercise a jurisdiction. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to
voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an Member
State (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary
liquidation).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a
compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this
will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out
netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made
for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of
the winding-up petition.

Once the winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be
imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court
although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order;
the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of
Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for
the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a
stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company
(and/or enforce their security).

303


-----

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business
of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute
documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates
any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise
to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to
prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its
creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can
it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not
apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the
arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any
disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in
the winding-up.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one
of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question
and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes,
with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority,
as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be
made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless
creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets
are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken
of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance
owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing
administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which
the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency
set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed
by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the
company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in
respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the
creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and
the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation
of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off,
including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured
assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest
in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to
the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only;

    - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and
within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium
debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation
incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts
for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during
the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any
capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are
statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid;

    - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order
of priority in which expenses are paid); and

304


-----

    - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done
in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any
employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of
insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts
rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include:
(a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims
exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and
paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank
equally;

    - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined
herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting
benefit to creditors;

    - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This
would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created
it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge;

    - Seventh ranking:

o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall)
secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to
the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured
creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from
unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed
Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured
creditor elects to surrender its security;

o secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable
contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838
(currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation
or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a
distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under
the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the Noteholders may, if there are sufficient
realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are
fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English
Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and

    - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination
language in the relevant documentation.

See “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges” above for a description of the
Prescribed Part.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security
or guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the
company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the
relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English

305


-----

company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company, or certain
transactions entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right
of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is
the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint
an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes
effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is presented
to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution.
Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue
and preferences will be as for the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges,
is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of
the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or
civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.
A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with
whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he
is in partnership.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has
control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the
other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same
persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of
either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or
he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting
of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either
of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant
right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee
(or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction
at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person,
if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in
money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of
the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act)
and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset
of insolvency.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate
that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with
a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was
insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings.

In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good
faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds
for believing the transaction would benefit it.

306


-----

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it
thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which
could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees,
although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for
value). An order by the court in relation to a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose
any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the
transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other
than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and
will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to
the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant
right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee
(or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a
preference.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a
surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company
going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that
transaction not been entered into.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of
the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act)
and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the
security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending
with the onset of insolvency.

If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it
thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could
include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to
the same principles as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue). However, the court will
only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the
assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant
time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was
entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be
presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect,
and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open
to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency).

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above)
and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may
make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim
which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding
creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed
administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain
conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions
Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the
leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside
such transaction. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action and
the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction, or in
administration or liquidation for the provision to apply.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the Notes
or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any

307


-----

obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into.
However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than
the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require
a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply
to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk
accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant
payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit
or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this
basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be
challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within
three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part,
any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms
of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party
to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the
transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be
noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit
transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one
year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending
with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the
English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating
charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or
any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of
the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for the English obligor to be
insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is
granted to a connected person.

No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or
in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically
invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial
Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis.

As referred to above (see “—Fixed and Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterized
as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently recharacterized has been granted within
the relevant suspect period referred to above, this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the
Consideration provided.

**_Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003_**

The “Financial Collateral Regulations” apply in respect of certain security interests granted over, and certain
title transfer arrangements in, “financial collateral” (together, “financial collateral arrangements”). Financial
collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The
definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims
under loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was
to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial
collateral arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the UK. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process
of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations, certain
modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove restrictions on

308


-----

enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or
liquidation and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain
situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to
be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on
enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration. Furthermore, the
Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become
the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interest applies without the need for a
court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided
the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “CIGA 2020”) enacted fundamental
reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed
in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The measures include (but are not limited to) the following:

(a) _Moratorium_

The CIGA 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide
companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under
the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies
(including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market
arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during
the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include
any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration
or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The
Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1
moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from
being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from
time to time.

Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing
the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company
that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a
better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible
overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium.

Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the
company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency
practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium
would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for
a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent
that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior
to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a
contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements)
entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are
therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay
such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the
moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including
commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor
or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any
pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The CIGA 2020 includes a carve-out for
enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration, Administrative

309


-----

_Receivership and Floating Charges,” “—Avoidance of Transactions—Grant of Floating Charge” and “—_
_Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a_
collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a
floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a
floating charge asset be imposed.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a
company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period,
any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses
of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs
or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such
creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver).

Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s
activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions
without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction
will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments
in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total
amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at
the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course.

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on
which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of
the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with
the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor
of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and
confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment
holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available:

    - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the
possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than
50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by
number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only
creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which
has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have
the right to vote;

    - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

    - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is
implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and

    - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with
the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan).

(b) _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited_

The CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the
imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been
triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings
include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and
restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s
insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose
before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the
relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A
supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any
outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if
the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the
continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved
in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new
prohibition.

310


-----

(c) _Restructuring plan_

The CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under CA06,
but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders
(not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new
standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act
with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude
certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most
situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as
can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company).

Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely
to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a
going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose
of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties”
test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts within
the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike
schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be
filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members
(or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and
whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent
to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class
composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or
arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is
satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference
to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the
company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised
under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons
for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has
jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the
proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class,
accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company.

The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or
classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of
creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme
of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a
convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in
respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not
be compromised under the plan without their consent.

Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan
requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to
sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor
of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if:

(i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the
restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e., what the court considers
to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and

(ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of
creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the
event of that “relevant alternative” scenario.

A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of
it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in
the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).

**_Foreign Currency_**

311


-----

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pounds sterling at a single rate for
each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the “relevant date”
(generally speaking, being the date on which the company entered administration or liquidation). This provision
overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply
to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, Noteholders may be
subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which such English
obligor goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such Noteholders
may become entitled. The English Supreme Court’s ruling in the Lehman Brothers case established that any such
holder of the Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a fall in
the value of pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution.

**_Foreign Laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or other
right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security)
is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity, priority
and enforceability of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third-Party Rights_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third-parties (including contracts and insurance policies)
may be subject to any rights of those third-parties.

**_Amendments_**

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or
other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates
without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English obligor or over shares of the English obligor are typically, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies
in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion
of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the
secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under
English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English company,
the banks with which those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any
time to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other
arrangements with that English company. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant
Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on
enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English company) and the
Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such
circumstances.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

312


-----

The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations of another group company
must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective
company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action,
there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the
respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with
an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.
Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the
proposed transaction. Section 172 of CA06 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers,
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members
as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may
be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a
court. Section 172(3) of CA06 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider
or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this
shift arises, the Supreme Court has recently held that it takes place when the company in question is insolvent or
bordering on insolvency, or when an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent
they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General Position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable
in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which was implemented in Great Britain via the
Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency
proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is
determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another
jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency
officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been
implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings
(if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings
(if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not
regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of
courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of
Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano
**Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition,**
recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations
(“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of
law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and
fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted
the latter position).

_Recognition in the European Union_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer
benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in Member States. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed
between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK
insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border

313


-----

insolvencies involving the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and
increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to
effectively deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant Member State and the need
may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases
where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI
rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent
relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for
recognition in Member States.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States
may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a Member State. It is
not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors
may be adversely affected as a result.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, NatWest Markets Plc, BNP Paribas, Coöperatieve
Rabobank U.A. trading as Rabobank London, Goldman Sachs International and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets
plc are the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be dated
as of the date of the final offering memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the
Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the principal amount of the Offered Notes as set forth
in the Purchase Agreement.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Offered Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Offered Notes may from time to time be
varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

Persons who purchase Offered Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price
set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Offered Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase all
of the Offered Notes sold under the Purchase Agreement if any of the Offered Notes are purchased.

The Purchase Agreement further provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Parent has agreed, subject to certain limited
exceptions, that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates will offer, sell, contract to sell,
issue or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or
guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year during the period
from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the
Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Offered Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. Resales of the Offered Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that:

- it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Market Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”)) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of the Offered Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to the Issuer;

- it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Offered Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK;

- it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available
the Offered Notes to any retail investor in the EEA (and for the purposes of this paragraph the expression
“retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation); and

- it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available
the Offered Notes to any retail investor in the UK (and for the purposes of this paragraph the expression
“retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565, as amended, as it forms part of UK domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any
rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No

600/2014, as amended, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation).

Each Initial Purchaser acknowledges that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States
and the UK, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly
or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange, however we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be
maintained. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes,
and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it
will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which
will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant
Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the
stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Offered Notes
in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit
the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Offered Notes originally
sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These
stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Offered Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time. In connection with this Offering, a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf,
may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Offered Notes. Specifically,
a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the
purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Offered Notes. A stabilizing manager may also over
allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Offered Notes in the open
market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, a stabilizing manager may bid for and purchase Notes in
market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These
activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Offered Notes above market levels that may
otherwise prevail. A stabilizing manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities
at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See
“Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in
_which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Offered Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after
the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this Offering is made and, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they
must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Offered Notes and 60 days after the
date of the allotment of the Offered Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or
otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which
may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management,
principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have
engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking (including hedging) and/ or commercial banking

transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for
which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Certain of Barclays Bank PLC,
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, NatWest Markets Plc, BNP Paribas, Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. trading
as Rabobank London, Goldman Sachs International and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc or their respective
affiliates are mandated lead arrangers, original lenders and/or bookrunners under the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, the Existing Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, as applicable
and may therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering. Barclays Bank PLC is also the facility agent
and security agent under these agreements. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers are also lenders under the
Liquidity Facility Agreement in relation to the Unique Securitized Notes. In addition, certain Initial Purchasers
were bookrunners for the Existing Notes. Barclays Bank PLC is a cash confirmation bank for the Existing PIK
Facility Agreement. Further, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities
(or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for
the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the Notes). The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates
that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also
make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short
positions in such securities and instruments.

Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to this Offering or sale of any Notes (and the
Note Guarantees), other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering

with respect to the Offered Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person
representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, adequacy or
completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. It also acknowledges that it
has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Offered Notes as it has
deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Offered Notes.

which it is purchasing the Offered Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Offered Notes by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the
date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of Notes sold in reliance on Rule
144A, one year after the later of the date of the Issue Date; the last date on which the Issuer or any of its
affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or the last date on which the additional
Notes were issued and, in the case of Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S, 40 days after the later of
the date of the Issue Date; the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such
Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or the last date on which the additional Notes were issued only (i) to

the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for
its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the
transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales

or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory
to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form
appearing on the other side of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and its registered office is in England
and Wales. The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated in, and have their respective principal executive offices
or registered offices, as applicable, in the Cayman Islands or England and Wales. All of the directors and the
executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. The assets of the Issuer
and the Guarantors and the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States.
It may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, a
Guarantor or such persons or to enforce against any of the judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, and there is uncertainty as to the
recognition and enforceability in England and Wales or the Cayman Islands of civil liabilities predicated upon the
federal securities laws of the United States (or any state or other jurisdiction thereof), either in original actions or
in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States.

The United States and the UK currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a
final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or
enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated
before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court and/or enforce a judgment, provided that
(subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim
(assuming that the defense to it has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason for trial).

Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among
other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original
proceedings according to English conflict of laws principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in
respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to
penal, revenue or other public law.

An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that:

- the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy;

- the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1
of the Act;

- the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial
justice;

- the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court
whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court;

- the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or

- the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose
jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

-----

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from
U.S. federal or state courts in civil and commercial matters. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you
that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an
English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England,
instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

The Cayman Islands currently have no treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters with any jurisdiction (other than in
respect of certain judgments of certain superior courts in the Commonwealth of Australia). Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Cayman
Islands.

However, the courts of the Cayman Islands may recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment
in personam obtained in U.S. federal or state courts under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of
money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or
other penalty) or, in certain circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief, and would give a
judgment based thereon without any re-examination of the merits provided that:

(a) such U.S. courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment as a matter of Cayman
Islands law conflict of law rules;

(b) such U.S. courts did not contravene rules of natural justice;

(c) the judgment of such U.S. courts was not obtained by fraud;

(d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands
(awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy);

(e) the judgment is not inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter;

(f) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by
the courts of the Cayman Islands; and

(g) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**1** **Accounting policies and basis of preparation**

Stonegate Pub Company Limited (the “Company”) is governed by Cayman Island Company Law and is limited by
shares.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements consolidates those results of the Company and its
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with Companies Law (2013 Revision) of the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands do
not have prescribed accounting standards, the Group has elected to prepare the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting as adopted for use in the UK’, as allowed
under Cayman Island Company Law.

The results for the 28 weeks ended 7 April 2024 and the 28 weeks ended 9 April 2023 are unaudited. The financial
information for the year ended 24 September 2023 is extracted from the accounts for that year which are subject
to a non-statutory audit for the purpose of filing accounts of the UK branch of this overseas Group and formally
setting out the financial performance and position of the Group.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a consistent basis using the
accounting policies set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 24 September 2023. There have
been no new standards that have been adopted during the period.

**1.1** **Going concern**

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which the directors believe to be appropriate for the
following reasons. The Group has continued to meet its day-to-day working capital requirements through its
standard trading cycle of cash generation when sites are open, charging and collecting rents from publicans and its
overdraft facility of £25 million and revolving credit facility of £248 million. The continued availability of the revolving
credit facility is subject to ongoing compliance with covenants. The Directors consider that this is a normal feature
of trading in this industry.

At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt totalling £3,567 million (9 April 2023: £3,039
million; 24 September 2023: £3,013 million), of which an amount of £342 million related to the Unique securitisation
is subject to covenants that are tested quarterly and, if breached, would result in the debt becoming repayable on
demand. The Group was compliant with all covenants at the test dates falling in the period.

During the period, the Group completed on a limited recourse financing structure over a portfolio of 1,034 of its
freehold pubs in order to raise a principal amount of £638 million senior debt against them. Although the
securitisation is subject to a covenant, it is not due to be tested until May 2026.

The Board have reviewed the cash flow forecasts for the Group for the period through to July 2025 (“the going
concern assessment period”). This period incorporates at least 12 months from the date of signing these interim
financial statements, and incorporates the significant debt expiring in July 2025.

The base case forecasts reviewed by the Board reflect levels of trade across the Group in line with the current
financial year, sales price increases below inflation, labour cost rises to ensure the Group remains paying at least
National Living Wage and certain out of contract cost price increases. The base case also assumes that the £638
million raised from the transaction is available to the wider Stonegate Group and £248 million of RCF due to expire
in September 2024 is extended for at least another year on current terms.

As well as the base case forecasts indicating that there is sufficient liquidity in the Group, the forecasts also indicate
that there are no breaches to covenants within either the Group’s revolving credit facility, the Unique securitisation
nor the covenant within the committed facilities.

The Board has also considered a severe but plausible scenario incorporating a 5% reduction in retail sales volumes
from the cost-of-living crisis within its Managed and Operator-led segments. It has been assumed that variable costs
move in line with the reduction in sales. These forecasts indicate that in this severe but plausible downside, there
remains sufficient liquidity within the Group. In addition, the covenants would not be breached.

Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements

**Notes (continued)**

**1.1** **Going concern (continued)**

The Directors have also considered the significant portion of debt that expires in July 2025. There is a risk that should
the £2.3 billion debt not be refinanced, the Group would not have the ability to repay it when it falls due. Steps to
refinance the debt are well progressed, but these haven’t been executed at the date of approval of these financial
statements.

Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going
concern basis. However, since the refinancing plans haven’t been executed, there is an indication that a material
uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going
concern assessment period, and therefore that the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its
liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not contain the adjustments that would
result if the Group were unable to continue as a going concern.

**1.2** **Key accounting judgements**

The following are the key judgements that management have made in the period in applying the Group’s accounting
policies as disclosed in the financial statements of the Group for the period ended 24 September 2023.

_Impairment of goodwill_

The Group’s performance has been in line with forecasts used in the September 2023 impairment review. Therefore,
Management do not consider there to be any further indicators of impairment that would trigger an impairment
review at the current reporting date.

_Valuation of property, plant and equipment, and investment property_

Properties are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising
from changes in the fair value of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the revaluation reserve except
where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an expense in the
income statement in which case the reversal of the revaluation decrease is recognised in the income statement. Any
deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus
in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is recognised in the income statement as an
expense. Changes to the fair value of investment properties are recognised in the income statement in the period
in which they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external valuers. Management
have judged that the valuation reached at 24 September 2023 still represents the best estimate of the fair value of
such properties at 7 April 2024.

_Going concern_
The Directors exercise judgement when concluding on going concern as the basis of preparation of the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. For further details see note 1.1.

**Notes (continued)**

**2** **Segmental reporting**

The Directors determine the appropriate operating segments based on the discrete management information
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Group has five distinguishable revenue
generating operating segments being Pub Partners, Commercial Property, Stonegate, Craft Union and Joint
Ventures, and the CODM reviews discrete information on these segments. These have been aggregated into three
reportable segments as outlined below:

1) Leased and tenanted comprising Pub Partners and Commercial Property – The Group receives rental
income from leasing these sites to third parties. Revenue is also received from tied sites within Pub Partners
for the supply of drinks and gaming machines. The Group has no direct involvement in the operation of
each site.

2) Managed comprising Stonegate and Joint Ventures – The Group generates revenue from the sale of food,
drink, admission, accommodation and gaming machine income. Each site is fully managed by the Group,
such that the Group is exposed to all operational risks and in return receives the full retail margin.

3) Operator-led comprising Craft Union – The Group receives revenue from the sale of food, drink, admission
and gaming machine income. The Group contracts with an operating company to manage the day-to-day
operations of the site for which they receive a turnover-based fee. All labour costs are borne by the
operating company, with all other costs being borne by the Group. The Group has access to the full retail
margin.

Central costs represent certain head office expenses which are not attributable to specific segments. Accordingly,
these costs are disclosed as a separate column within the segmental notes.

The CODM reviews the financial results by segment to EBITDA, which represents operating profit / (loss) before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment, movement in valuation of the estate and profit on sale of non-current
assets, and this therefore provides the basis for the disclosures below. Inter-segment revenues and costs are
eliminated upon consolidation such that all numbers disclosed in the table below are with external customers. All of
the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is not further segmented based on location, therefore
no geographical segmental analysis has been provided. The balance sheet is not reviewed by the CODM on a
segmented basis and therefore no disclosure has been made in relation to segmental assets and liabilities.

**Business interruption:** Following the closure of pubs as a result of Covid-19 the Group received £40 million of
proceeds relating to business interruption during this period of closure (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023: £Nil; 52 weeks
ended 24 September 2023: £1 million costs incurred relating to the insurance claim).

**Surrender premiums: During the period £1 million (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023: £1 million;** 52 weeks ended 24
September 2023: £2 million) of assignment premiums were paid to publicans in order to take the assignment of a
lease or to break a lease at any point other than at renewal. Following the acquisition of Ei Group Limited, the Group
are looking to review the entire portfolio of assets and move pubs across segments into their perceived optimum
operating format. This one-off process is likely to take five years, during which time any assignment premiums paid
will be shown as exceptional.

**Business reorganisation:** During the period £3 million (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023: £Nil; 52 weeks ended 24
September 2023: £5 million) has been incurred in relation to a Group restructuring of its support function, including
associated legal and professional fees.

**Professional fees associated with Group restructuring: During the period £11 million (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023:**
£Nil; 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023: £Nil) has been incurred in relation to a Group restructure to optimise the
structure and a move portfolio of pubs out of the restricted group.

**Other non-recurring costs: During the period £1 million (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023: £Nil; 52 weeks ended 24**
September 2023: £Nil) was incurred in relation to the dual costs of distribution to facilitate a change of provider.

**Other gains: In the 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023 a health and safety insurance case was concluded and as a**
result £1 million was released from provisions to the income statement (28 weeks ended 7 April 2024: £Nil; 28 weeks
ended 9 April 2023: £Nil).

Non-current assets held for sale comprises properties that have been identified by the Group for disposal as part
of the continued disposal programme. The sale of all assets within this category is expected to be completed within
one year of the balance sheet date.

When assets are identified for disposal and meet the criteria within IFRS 5 they are reclassified from property, plant
and equipment to non-current assets held for sale and are revalued at that point to their fair value less costs to
dispose if this is lower than their carrying value. Investment property assets are also moved to non-current assets
held for sale at book value when they meet the criteria within IFRS 5.

Included in non-current assets held for sale are 55 sites at 7 April 2024 (9 April 2023: 51 sites; 24 September 2023:
63 sites).

During the period, on 26 January 2024, the Group completed on a limited recourse financing structure over a
portfolio of 1,034 of its freehold pubs in order to raise a principal amount of £638 million (the Portfolio loans). The
portfolio comprises 944 leased and tenanted and 90 free-of-tie freehold pubs. The portfolio was acquired by newly
incorporated, wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries of Stonegate Pub Company Limited. As part of the transaction,
Stonegate has entered into agreements with these subsidiaries on an arm’s length basis to provide the portfolio
with certain management and procurement services. The Group has received £609 million cash proceeds from third
party financing providers, which was net of a funded interest reserve, arrangement fees and other expenses. The
loan matures three years post-closing and has the benefit of two one-year extension periods at the behest of the
Group. Interest accrues at three-month SONIA (floored at 2.5%) plus 6.35%, which is cash settled quarterly. There
exists a net debt to EBITDA covenant which must not exceed 5.15 times at the point it is first tested in May 2026.
The newly financed portfolio will continue to be consolidated within the Group financial statements.

In relation to those leases under IFRS 16, for the 28 weeks ending 7 April 2024, the Group’s operating profit metric
improved by £15 million as the new depreciation expense is lower than the IAS 17 operating lease charge (28 weeks
ended 9 April 2023: £10 million; 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023: £21 million). Interest expense was charged of
£25 million (28 weeks ended 7 April 2023: £26 million; 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023: £48 million), such that
net profit after tax is lower compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023: lower;
52 weeks ended 24 September 2023: lower). Operating profit before depreciation, amortisation, impairment,
movement in valuation of the estate and profit on sale of non-current assets is higher compared to the previous IAS
17 reporting basis (28 weeks ended 9 April 2023: higher; 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023: higher).

**16** **Pensions**

The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The
assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.

The defined benefit obligation as at 7 April 2024 is calculated on a year-to-date basis using the latest available
actuarial valuation at 24 September 2023, being as at 28 February 2023, and the minimum funding requirements as
at 24 September 2023, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary. Differences between the expected
return on assets and the actual return on assets have been recognised as an actuarial gain or loss in the consolidated
statement of total recognised gains and losses in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy.

The Group also participates in defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of certain employees. The assets
of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.

The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect
of the accounting period.

**17** **Related party transactions**

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on
consolidation and are not contained in this note.

Included in amounts due from parent undertakings is a balance of £1 million owing from Stonegate Pub Company
Pikco Limited, a parent undertaking (9 April 2023: £1 million; 24 September 2023: £1 million).

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements**

The directors of Stonegate Pub Company Limited ('the directors') have accepted responsibility for the preparation
of the Strategic report, Director’s report and non-statutory Group accounts for the period ended 24 September 2023
which are intended by them to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss
for that period. They have decided to prepare the non-statutory Group accounts in accordance with UK-adopted
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and applicable Cayman Island company law. In preparing these
non-statutory Group accounts, the directors have:

- selected suitable accounting policies and applied them consistently;

- made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- stated whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, UK-adopted international accounting standards;

- assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

concern; and

- used the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations,

or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
non-statutory Group accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

#### Independent auditor’s report to Stonegate Pub Company Limited (“the Company”)

 We have audited the financial statements of Stonegate Pub Company Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”) for the 52 week period ended 24 September 2023 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.

#### Material uncertainty related to going concern

 We draw attention to note 1.2 to the financial statements which describes the £2.3 billion of debt due for repayment in July 2025. There is a risk that should the debt not be re- financed, the Group would not have the ability to repay it when it falls due. These events and conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 1.2, constitute a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

 Going concern basis of preparation

 The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis. As stated above, they have concluded that a material uncertainty related to going concern exists.

 Our conclusion based on our financial statements audit work: we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

 Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – ability to detect

 Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

 To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

- Enquiring of directors and members of the Operational Board and inspection of policy
#### documentation as to the wider Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the wider Group's channel for "whistleblowing", as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud. 

- Reading Board meeting minutes.

- Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.

- Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets

- Our forensic specialists assisted us in identifying key fraud risks. This included
#### attending the Risk Assessment and Planning Discussion, holding a discussion with the engagement partner, engagement manager, and assisting with designing relevant audit procedures to respond to the identified fraud risks.

 We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.

 As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group management may be

On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because within pub revenue the risk arising from site level fraud is limited due to the size of the estate and number of individual sites, and in relation to rental income each tenant has a signed contractual agreement that billing and collection is based on. 

 We also identified a fraud risk related to the valuation of property, plant and equipment and investment property, in as management has an opportunity and incentive to manipulate the valuation outcome.

 In determining the audit procedures, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of some of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.  

 We also performed procedures including:

- Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified
#### entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management and those posted to unusual accounts.

- Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are
#### indicative of a potential bias, including assessing the valuation of property, plant and equipment and investment property for bias.

- Testing the accuracy of the underlying trading data that underpins the valuation of
#### property, plant and equipment and investment property

 Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations

 We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, and through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. 

 We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.

 The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. 

 Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies

**_KPMG LLP_**

#### legislation), and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. 

 Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, data protection, anti-bribery, employment law, pubs code and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach. 

 Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

 Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. 

 In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

 Other information

 The directors are responsible for the other information, which comprises the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover these reports and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

 Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work, we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 

 Directors’ responsibilities 

 As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 22, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements, which are intended by them to give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable

**_KPMG LLP_**

_18 January 2024_

#### the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

 Auditor’s responsibilities 

 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 

 A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 

 Our report has been prepared for Stonegate Pub Company Limited (“the Company”) solely in accordance with the terms of our engagement. It has been released to the Company on the basis that our report shall not be copied, referred to or disclosed, in whole (save for the Company’s own internal purposes) or in part, without our prior written consent. 

 Our report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of the Company determined by Company’s needs at the time.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1** **Accounting policies**

Stonegate Pub Company Limited (the “Company”) is governed by Cayman Island Company Law and is limited by
shares.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
“Group”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Companies Law (2013
Revision) of the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands do not have prescribed accounting standards, the Group has
elected to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards (“UK-adopted IFRS”), as allowed under Cayman Island Company Law.

There is no statutory requirement for accounts to be audited in the UK; however, these accounts are being prepared
and subject to a non-statutory audit for the purpose of filing accounts of the UK branch of this overseas Group and
formally setting out the financial performance and position of the Group.

No parent company information is presented in these consolidated financial statements, Companies Law (2013
Revision) in the Cayman Islands does not require such information to be presented. The parent company information
has been prepared under FRS 102. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**1.1** **Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are
stated at their fair value: financial liabilities (including derivatives) measured at fair value; property plant and
equipment, following the adoption of a valuation policy at 24 September 2023, and investment property. Noncurrent assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**1.2** **Going concern**

The macroeconomic environment has had a significant impact on the Group in the current year and will continue to
do so moving forward. Whilst inflation remains high, the cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom has led to lower
profit and operating cashflows than would otherwise have resulted had these conditions not existed.

The financial position of the Group is set out in the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 25 which shows net assets
of £601 million (2022: £109 million). During the 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023 the Group has experienced a
net cash outflow of £41 million (52 weeks ended 25 September 2022: net cash outflow of £91 million).

The Group has continued to meet its day-to-day working capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of
cash generation when sites are open, charging and collecting rents from publicans and its overdraft facility of £25
million and revolving credit facility of £248 million. The continued availability of the revolving credit facility is subject
to compliance with covenants (see note 23). The Directors consider that this is a normal feature of trading in this
industry. In the managed business, customers pay by cash or card at the point of sale, resulting in minimal credit
risk, whilst in the leased and tenanted business, the Group has a dedicated credit control function, who are able to
manage the credit risk exposure. The Group typically operates with net current liabilities (24 September 2023: £282
million (excludes drawn RCF); 25 September 2022: £251 million net current liabilities).

At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt totalling £3,013 million (25 September 2022:
£3,121 million), of which an amount of £426 million related to the Unique securitisation is subject to covenants that
are tested quarterly and, if breached, would result in the debt becoming repayable on demand. The Group was
compliant with all covenants at the year end test date. Details of the debt facilities are set out in note 22.

Subsequent to the year end on 20 December 2023, the Group has committed to moving just over 1,000 freehold
properties out of the restricted group and raising an amount of £638 million senior debt against them (see note 32).
This transaction is due to complete in January 2024 at which point there will be certain restrictions around the use
of cash generated by these sites which has previously been available to the wider Group in its entirety. Since the
Board are committed to the transaction before these financial statements are signed, they have deemed it
appropriate to review the going concern of the Group assuming this transaction has completed.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.2** **Going concern (continued)**

The Board have reviewed the cash flow forecasts for the Company and the Group for the period through to July 2025
(“the going concern assessment period”). This period incorporates at least 12 months from the date of signing these
financial statements, adjust for the expected impact of the committed additional debt raise and incorporates
significant debt expiring in July 2025.

The base case forecasts reviewed by the Board reflect levels of trade across the Group in line with the current year,
sales price increases below inflation, labour cost rises to ensure the Group remains paying at least National Living
Wage and certain out of contract cost price increases. The base case also assumes that the £638 million raised from
the committed transaction is available to the wider Stonegate Group and £248 million of RCF due to expire in
September 2024 is extended for at least another year on current terms.

As well as the base case forecasts indicating that there is sufficient liquidity in the Group, the forecasts also indicate
that there are no breaches to covenants within either the Group’s revolving credit facility, the Unique securitisation
nor the covenant within the committed facilities.

The Board has also considered a severe but plausible scenario incorporating a 5% reduction in retail sales volumes
from the cost-of-living crisis within its Managed and Operator-led segments. It has been assumed that variable costs
move in line with the reduction in sales. These forecasts indicate that in this severe but plausible downside, there
remains sufficient liquidity within the Group. In addition, the covenants would not be breached.

The Directors have also considered the significant portion of debt that expires in July 2025. There is a risk that should
the £2.3 billion debt not be refinanced, the Group would not have the ability to repay it when it falls due. Plans are
being formulated to refinance the debt, but these haven’t been executed at the date of approval of these financial
statements.

Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going
concern basis. However, since the refinancing plans haven’t been executed, there is an indication that a material
uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going
concern assessment period, and therefore that the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its
liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not contain the adjustments that would
result if the Group were unable to continue as a going concern.

**1.3** **Basis of consolidation**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights. The acquisition date
is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s
equity in those subsidiaries. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests.

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.4** **Change in significant accounting policies**

**IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment**

The Group has adopted a policy of revaluation at 24 September 2023 which is a change from the cost model used in
prior years. Management have concluded the presentation of property, plant and equipment at valuation instead of
cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses results in the financial statements reflecting
the importance of the property portfolio to the operations of the business by providing current information about
the fair value of the Group’s property portfolio to users of the accounts. The adoption of a revaluation policy for the
Group has been delayed since the acquisition of Ei Group Limited in March 2020 as a result of the uncertainty
regarding the industry’s post-Covid-19 recovery and the high inflationary environment.

The Group has applied this prospectively and accordingly has charged depreciation during the year and the
comparative information presented for 2022 has not been restated. On adoption at 24 September 2023, upwards
revaluations have been taken to the revaluation reserve whilst downward revaluations have been taken to the
income statement. Overall, there has been an upwards revaluation of £790 million which has credited the
revaluation reserve and a downwards revaluation of £48 million which has been debited to the income statement.

**1.5** **Key accounting judgements and estimates**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses during the period. Management periodically evaluates its estimates and judgements and bases them on
historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Key accounting judgements**

The following are the key judgements, apart from those involving estimations, dealt with separately below, that
management have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and which have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

_Exceptional items_

During the period certain items are identified and separately disclosed as exceptional. Judgement is applied as to
whether the item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed. This assessment covers the
nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that item on reported performance. Note 8
provides information on all of the items disclosed as exceptional in the current and previous period.

_Going concern_

The directors exercise judgement when concluding on going concern as the basis of preparation of the financial
statements. For further details see note 1.2.

_Presentation of deferred tax_

The tax base has changed in the period as a result of property, plant and equipment now being revalued and
measured at fair value. This has resulted in a movement in the deferred tax liability and a portion of this movement
does not directly relate to the revaluation. IAS 12 does not provide any guidance on how to allocate this overall
movement between the income statement and other comprehensive income and management have used
judgement to allocate this on a reasonable basis to reflect both the unwinding of existing deferred tax liabilities due
to the change in tax base through the income statement and revaluation through the statement of comprehensive
income.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.5** **Key accounting judgements and estimates (continued)**

**Key areas of estimation**

The following are the key areas of estimation uncertainty that may have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements.

_Valuation of property, plant and equipment, and investment property_

Licensed land and buildings are revalued annually to fair value in accordance with RICS Valuation – Global Standards
and IFRS 13. The valuation methodology uses an estimation of the fair maintainable trade (FMT) of a pub held in PPE
and commercial rent for a property held as an investment property and then applies a multiple. The FMT is estimated
based on historic trends and projected future income whilst multiples are determined by our valuers with reference
to each specific asset and market information. For more details on the FMT and multiple see note 14. The valuers
also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. An adjustment to any of these
assumptions could lead to a material change in the property valuation. The highest and best use for the licensed
land and buildings is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally due to the legal restrictions imposed
by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial implications of a change of use given
those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However, consideration is given to an alternative highest and
best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists which is physically possible, legally
permissible and financially feasible.

Further information about the valuation of the estate is provided in note 14 of these financial statements.

**1.6** **Financial instruments**

_Recognition and initial measurement_

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they originate. All other financial assets
and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial
liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), transaction
costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing
component is initially measured at the transaction price.

**_Classification and subsequent measurement_**

**_Financial assets_**

_(a)_ _Classification_

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other
comprehensive income (‘’FVOCI’’) – debt investment; FVOCI – equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not
reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period
following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and
selling financial assets; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present
subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment
basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at
FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets.

_(b)_ _Subsequent measurement and gains and losses_

_Financial assets at FVTPL - these assets (other than derivatives designated as hedging instruments) are subsequently_
measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or
loss.

_Financial assets at amortised cost - These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective_
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and
losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or
loss.

_Debt investments at FVOCI - these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using_
the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are
reclassified to profit or loss.

_Equity investments at FVOCI - these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as_
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other
net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

**_Financial liabilities and equity_**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two
conditions:

(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments
or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial
assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Group’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial
statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.

**1.6** **Financial instruments (continued)**

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL
if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial
liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised
in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing
financial liability. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability
or as a substantial modification, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the
extinguishment and written off through non-underlying finance costs and the new borrowings are recognised at fair
value. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a non-substantial modification, a gain or loss is recognised
at the time of the non-substantial modification (to the extent that there is a change in the expected amount or
timing of payments of interest and principal).

The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the present value of the cash flows (excluding fees) under
the original and modified terms discounted at the original effective interest rate. Any costs or fees incurred adjust
the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining life of the modified loan.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**1.7** **Property, plant and equipment**

Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held
at cost less depreciation.

The licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by external
valuers qualified to carry out such valuations.

Licensed land and buildings are revalued annually to fair value in accordance with RICS Valuation – Global Standards
and IFRS 13. The valuation methodology uses an estimation of the fair maintainable trade (FMT) of a pub held in PPE
and commercial rent for a property held as an investment property and then applies a multiple. The FMT is estimated
based on historic trends and projected future income whilst multiples are determined by our valuers with reference
to each specific asset and market information. For more details on the FMT and multiple see note 14.

The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. An adjustment to
any of these assumptions could lead to a material change in the property valuation.

The highest and best use for the licensed land and buildings is assumed to be their current use by the Group,
principally due to the legal restrictions imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the
financial  implications of a change of use given those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However,
consideration is given to an alternative highest and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative
use exists which is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.

Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation
reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an
expense in the income statement in which case the reversal of the revaluation decrease is recognised in the income
statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through other comprehensive income to the
revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in
value is recognised in the income statement as an expense.

Property, plant and equipment that are not included in the revaluation are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.7** **Property, plant and equipment (continued)**

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each item
of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

  - right-of-use assets are depreciated over their lease lives;

  - freehold properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values over 50 years;

  - leasehold properties and improvements are depreciated over the shortest of 50 years, their estimated
useful lives and their remaining lease periods;

  - long-life landlords’ fixtures and fittings are depreciated over 5 to 30 years;

  - retail, administration and short-life landlords’ furniture, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated
over 3 to 15 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

The Group capitalises employment costs and related personal expenses of individuals whose job roles are
fundamentally associated with managing or implementing the Group’s capital development programme. Judgement
is therefore applied in determining the element of internal labour costs which are directly attributable to capital
projects. Where such an individual undertakes non-capital expenditure related activities as part of their job roles
then a proportion of their cost is not capitalised unless the non-capital expenditure related activities are incidental
to their role.

Property, plant and equipment that are not included in the revaluation are reviewed annually for indications of
impairment. Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs
where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as an expense in the income
statement, and any subsequent impairment reversal as a gain in the income statement.

**1.8** **Investment property**

The Group leases some properties on commercial leases within the Commercial Properties segment. The commercial
terms of these leases result in the assets meeting the criteria of investment property. Properties held as investment
property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising
from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income statement in the period in which
they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external valuers.

Transfers are made to/from investment property when there is change of use evidenced by a change in the lease
terms. When a property transfers from property, plant and equipment to investment property, and vice versa, it is
revalued to fair value and the movement recognised in the income statement.

**1.9** **Non-current assets held for sale**

Properties identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are
held at the lower of carrying value on transfer to non-current assets held for sale, as assessed at the time of transfer,
and fair value less costs to dispose. The fair value less costs to dispose is based on the net estimated realisable
disposal proceeds (ERV) which is derived from internal valuations when the property is transferred to non-current
assets held for sale and then sense checked with third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the
properties.

Licensed land and buildings, investment property and right-of-use assets are classified as held for sale when they
have been identified for disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition
and the sale should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the
property or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Licensed land and buildings
held for sale are not depreciated and right of use assets held for sale are not amortised.

Profits or losses on disposal of property are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.10** **Business combinations**

Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition
method. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

_Acquisitions post transition date_

For acquisitions on or after 26 September 2011, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

  - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

  - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, if any; plus

  - the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

  - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed
as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise,
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

**1.11** **Intangible assets and goodwill**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is stated at cost less
any impairment. At 24 September 2023 the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments described in note
2. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the
Group’s operating segments. As properties move between segments the associated goodwill will also be transferred.

_Brand_

Brand intangible assets recognised on acquisition are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 10 years.

**Notes (continued)**

**1.12** **Leases**

_As a lessee_

The Group leases properties and vehicles.

At the inception of a contract the Group assesses whether that contract is or contains a lease. This is the case if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

The Group has elected not to apply the lessee requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases and leases for which the
underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments for such leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

For all other leases where it is the lessee the Group recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use asset at the
commencement date of the lease.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments at commencement date,
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The carrying amount of the lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and
decreased by lease payments made.

The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index
rate or, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as
appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be
exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

For rent concessions in leases the Group assesses whether there is a lease modification. The lease liability is then remeasured at the present value of the revised lease payments at the modification date, discounted using the interest
rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The
change in the present value of the lease liability is accounted for as an increase to the right-of-use asset where it
relates to a future change, with any element relating to a past payment dated before the modification date
accounted for in the income statement.

The right-of-use asset is recognised at an amount equal to the total of the lease liability, any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs and the estimated future dismantling, removal and site
restoration costs. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in
‘property, plant and equipment’, the same line item as it presents underlying assets of the same nature that it owns.

Right-of-use assets included in property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost, and subsequently at
cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurements or
modifications of the lease liability. Where the right-of-use asset is in relation to an investment property it is initially
measured at cost, and subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Where a property held on lease transfers from PPE to investment property the right of use asset is revalued to fair
value before transfer.

**1.12** **Leases (continued)**

_As a lessor_

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration
in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone price. When the Group acts as a
lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease;
if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether
the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease,
not with reference to the underlying asset.

Where a property that is leased is re-leased to a third party and that sub-lease is categorised as a finance lease the
right of use asset is derecognised and it is replaced by a financial asset being the net investment in that sublease.
The net investment in the sub-lease is calculated as the net present value of the future rent payments receivable at
the interest rate implicit in the sub-lease or, if that cannot be readily determined, at the discount rate used for the
head lease.

The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The
Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in
the lease.

The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the
lease term as part of revenue.

_Leases acquired in a business combination_

For leases acquired in a business combination, the Group measures the acquired lease liability at the present value
of the remaining lease payments, as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. The right-of-use
asset is measured at acquisition at the same amount as the lease liability, adjusted to reflect favourable or
unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms.

**1.13** **Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
less any costs of disposal. Cost is calculated using the first in first out method.

**1.14** **Trade receivables and trade payables**

Trade receivables are held at their original invoiced amount net of an Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) allowance based
on the simplified model as allowed by IFRS 9. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure
the expected lifetime credit losses on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic
bad debt experience to create an ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the
reporting date. The Group writes off its trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the
debt.

Trade payables are held at amortised cost.

**1.15** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents
for the purpose only of the cash flow statement. The Group was not drawn on its bank overdraft facility at 24
September 2023 or 25 September 2022.

**Notes (continued)**

**1.16** **Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

_Financial assets (including receivables)_

The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an expected credit loss (ECL)
provision. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure the expected lifetime credit losses
on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic bad debt experience to create an
ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the reporting date. The Group writes off its
trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the debt. The carrying amount of financial
assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

_Non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than properties held at valuation, inventories and
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment
or impairment reversals. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill,
and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount
is estimated each year at the same time.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped
together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).

The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each relevant CGU is reviewed for
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or for
impairment reversals. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. Where fair
value is used this is based on known sales proceeds or an external valuation. Any changes in outlet earnings or cash
flows, the discount rate applied to those cash flows and fair value could give rise to an additional impairment loss.

The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill
to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is
monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments. The recoverable amount of the
CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require
estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying
amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised
in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had
been recognised. The reversal is recognised in the income statement.

**1.17** **Employee benefits**

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net
obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit
is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The
Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit
liability/asset.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity
dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the
benefits are expected to be paid. Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest).
The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined
benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to
past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the
plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified
actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised
asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.

The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The
gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being
settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and
any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past
service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

_Share-based payment transactions_

Where the Group or Company’s parent grants rights to its equity instruments to this Group or Company’s employees,
which are accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated accounts of the parent, the Group or Company as the
case may be account for these share-based payments as equity-settled. As the shares to be given to the employees
are not the Group or Company’s own equity instruments and have been effectively paid for by the parent entity, the
Group or Company recognises a share-based payment expense in its income statement and an associated capital
contribution in equity from its parent.

The fair value of share-based payments awards at the date of grant is recognised as an employee expense, with a
corresponding increase in equity as stated above, over the period that the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the awards. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking
into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.18** **Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, that can be reliably measured, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax discount rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

A provision for onerous leases is made for non-trading sites closure costs.

**1.19** **Revenue**

Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal
course of business, net of discounts and VAT. Revenue from drink and food is recognised at the point at which the
goods are provided. Property rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.

**Leased and tenanted**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from the supply of drink products to publicans and revenue is recognised_
at the point of delivery to the pub at which point physical possession is passed and the publican takes control of the
product, obtaining the significant risks and rewards of ownership. The proceeds from the sale are recognised as
revenue.

_Rent revenue – Rent revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease based on the contractual_
terms of the lease agreement.

_Revenue from amusement and other machines – Amusement machine royalty income represents the Group’s share_
of the net income earned from machines in the Group’s properties. The revenue is recognised in the period to which
the sale relates.

**Managed**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from retail sale of drinks to customers and is recognised at the point of_
delivery.

_Food revenue –_ Food revenue is earned from retail sale of food to customers and is recognised at the point of
delivery.

_Revenue from amusement and other machines – Amusement machine income represents the income earned from_
machines in our managed properties. The revenue is recognised in the period to which the sale relates.

_Admission, accommodation and other revenue – Other revenue includes admission and accommodation income and_
is recognised at the point of delivery.

**Operator-led**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from retail sale of drinks to customers and is recognised at the point of_
delivery.

_Food revenue –_ Food revenue is earned from retail sale of food to customers and is recognised at the point of
delivery.

_Revenue from amusement and other machines – Amusement machine income represents the income earned from_
machines in our managed properties. The revenue is recognised in the period to which the sale relates.

_Admission, accommodation and other revenue – Other revenue includes admission and accommodation income and_
is recognised in the period to which the sale relates.

**Notes (continued)**

**1.20** **Government Grants**

Money received in the form of a government grant is treated as revenue. Therefore, grant income is recorded within
other income in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods as the related expenses are
incurred.

**1.21** **Supplier incentives**

Supplier incentives and rebates are recognised within operating costs as they are earned. The accrued value at the
reporting date is included in trade and other receivables.

**1.22** **Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
periods.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided
for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**1.23** **Exceptional items**

The Group presents separately on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense
which are outside of the normal course of trading, which management consider will distort comparability, in order
to provide a trend measure of underlying performance. This includes the profit / (loss) on sale of property,
movements in the valuation of investment properties and property, plant and equipment and the impairment of
property, plant and equipment and goodwill which do not directly result from the underlying trading performance
of the Group and are not in their direct control, and therefore have been categorised as exceptional items. These
costs are discussed further in note 8.

**1.24** **Adopted IFRS not yet applied**

The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:

  - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent (effective date to be confirmed).

  - Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to introduce a new
definition for accounting estimates (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statements 2 Making
Materiality Judgements (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single
Transaction (effective from 1 January 2023).

**Notes (continued)**

**2** **Segmental reporting**

The directors determine the appropriate operating segments based on the discrete management information
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).

The Group has five distinguishable revenue generating operating segments being Pub Partners, Commercial
Property, Stonegate, Craft Union and Joint Ventures, and the CODM reviews discrete information on these
segments. These have been aggregated into three reportable segments as outlined below:

1) Leased and tenanted comprising Pub Partners and Commercial Property – The Group receives rental income from
leasing these sites to third parties. Revenue is also received from tied sites within Pub Partners for the supply of
drinks and gaming machines. The Group has no direct involvement in the operation of each site.

2) Managed comprising Stonegate and Joint Ventures – The Group generates revenue from the sale of food, drink,
admission, accommodation and gaming machine income. Each site is fully managed by the Group, such that the
Group is exposed to all operational risks and in return receives the full retail margin.

3) Operator-led comprising Craft Union – The Group receives revenue from the sale of food, drink, admission and
gaming machine income. The Group contracts with an operating company to manage the day-to-day operations of
the site for which they receive a turnover-based fee. All labour costs are borne by the operating company, with all
other costs being borne by the Group. The Group has access to the full retail margin.

Central costs represent certain head office expenses which are not attributable to specific segments. Accordingly,
these costs are disclosed as a separate column within the segmental notes.

The CODM reviews the financial results by segment to EBITDA, which represents operating profit / (loss) before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment, revaluation, and profit on sale of non-current assets, and this therefore
provides the basis for the disclosures below. Inter-segment revenues and costs are eliminated upon consolidation
such that all numbers disclosed in the table below are with external customers.

All of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is not further segmented based on location,
therefore no geographical segmental analysis has been provided. The balance sheet is not reviewed by the CODM
on a segmented basis and therefore no disclosure has been made in relation to segmental assets and liabilities.

**Business interruption insurance: Following the closure of pubs as a result of Covid-19 the Group incurred £1 million**
in the period (2022: £4 million) of costs in relation to an insurance claim relating to business interruption during this
period of closure.

**Surrender premiums: During the period £2 million (2022: £3 million) of assignment premiums were paid to publicans**
in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other than at renewal. Following the
acquisition of Ei Group Limited, the Group are looking to review the entire portfolio of assets and move pubs across
segments into their perceived optimum operating format. This one-off process is likely to take five years, during
which time any assignment premiums paid will be shown as exceptional.

**Business reorganisation:** During the period £5 million (2022: £Nil) has been incurred in relation to a Group
restructuring of its support function, including associated legal and professional fees.

**Impairment of goodwill:** Impairment of £178 million was recognised in the 52 weeks ended 24 September 2023
(2022: £44 million). Further details of this impairment charge can be found in note 15.

**Profit on sale of non-current assets: 85 properties (2022: 69 properties) and various other plots of land with a book**
value of £48 million (2022: £46 million) and lease liability value of £11 million (2022: £8 million) were disposed of
generating net proceeds of £49 million (2022: £46 million) after taking account of disposal costs. In accordance with
IAS 36, £2 million (2022: £1 million) of goodwill was allocated to these disposals. Included in the prior period
disposals were two sites which were required to be disposed under the CMA guidelines following the acquisition of
Ei Group Limited in March 2020 (two completed in the prior period and 40 completed in the 52 weeks ended 26
September 2021). Also included in the profit on disposal was a charge for estimated dilapidation costs for certain
properties of £2 million (2022: £1 million). This resulted in an overall profit of £8 million (2022: £6 million).

**Net finance income: Included in the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2022 was £1 million of interest received from**
HMRC in relation to a repayment.

**UK income tax credit: UK income tax credit of £83 million (2022: £20 million) relating to exceptional items includes**
a deferred tax credit of £52 million (2022: £Nil) arising from the change in accounting policy to revalue the property
estate, which led to revised expectations for the future tax base of those properties and a deferred tax credit of £25
million (2022: £2 million charge) for indexation claimed on chargeable gains arising as a result of that change in
accounting policy. The remainder of the total exceptional tax credit relates to tax credits on exceptional items of £6
million (2022: £22 million).

The Group’s licensed land and buildings held in property, plant and equipment and investment property were valued
at 24 September 2023 on the basis of open market value for existing use, following the Group’s decision to adopt a
revaluation policy. The valuations were undertaken in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors in the United Kingdom by Avison Young (UK) Limited, independent Chartered
Surveyors.

On adoption at 24 September 2023, upwards revaluations have been taken to the revaluation reserve whilst
downward revaluations have been taken to the income statement. Overall, there has been an upwards revaluation
of £790 million which has credited the revaluation reserve and a downwards revaluation of £48 million which has
been debited to the income statement. See note 14 for further information.

Non-current assets held for sale comprises properties that have been identified by the Group for disposal as part
of the continued disposal programme. The sale of all assets within this category is expected to be completed within
one year of the balance sheet date.

When assets are identified for disposal and meet the criteria within IFRS 5 they are reclassified from property, plant
and equipment to non-current assets held for sale and are revalued at that point to their estimated fair value less
costs to dispose if this is lower than their carrying value. Investment property assets are also moved to non-current
assets held for sale at book value when they meet the criteria within IFRS 5.

Included in non-current assets held for sale are 63 sites, of which two are non-trading sites (25 September 2022:
36 sites).

**14** **Property fair value measurements**

At 24 September 2023 the Group has adopted a revaluation policy for property, plant and equipment and as such
have engaged a third-party valuer, Avison Young (UK) Limited, to conduct a full estate valuation as at the year end
date. A sample of 20% of properties were inspected and the remainder were desk reviewed.

In determining the appropriate classes of asset to present for fair value purposes, the Group has considered the
nature, characteristics and risks of the assets. This has resulted in determining two separate classes of assets being
property assets held in property, plant and equipment and property assets held in investment property.

**Revaluation of property assets held in property, plant and equipment and investment property**

Valuations will be carried out on an annual basis at each period end date. With the exception of properties identified
for disposal and transferred to non-current assets held for sale, the Group’s properties were revalued as at 24
September 2023 by Avison Young (UK) Limited or have been valued internally.

All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market
observable inputs.

Property assets held in property, plant and equipment were valued using fair maintainable trade income (FMT)
capitalised at an appropriate rate of return (as defined within RICS Valuation - Global Standards) or an equivalent
multiple. This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable trade, rent, wholesale
and machine income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient
operator, taking into account future trading potential. This assessment of profit is then capitalised at an appropriate
multiple to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. The valuation of the managed pub assets is prepared using
a consistent approach that effectively capitalises the net income attributable to the Group from operating the pub
at an appropriate multiple.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**14** **Property fair value measurements (continued)**

In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting
fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed landlords' fixtures and fittings. The valuation of
the managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent approach that effectively capitalises the net income
attributable to the Group from operating the pub at an appropriate multiple.

Property assets held in investment property include free-of-tie pubs let to tenants at open market rents and nonpub assets. These assets have been valued adopting the investment method of valuation. By reference to the rents,
fixed lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple based on comparable market transactions is
applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value.

As valuers make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties an adjustment to any of
these assumptions could lead to a material change in the property valuation.

All classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. IFRS 13 prescribes that the
Group's current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that a
different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations, the valuers
consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value where
applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a higher and
better use. In the current period the highest and best use of all the property assets in property, plant and equipment
and investment property has been assessed as their existing use.

The impact of the revaluation is as follows:

The table below presents, by class of property, the income and multiple bandings within which the properties have
been valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings. In determining the
bandings to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property, but has
concluded that the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this form the most appropriate
disclosure.

**Sensitivity analysis table**

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy of the Group’s estate are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited amount of interrelation between the
variation in these inputs.

A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the overall valuation of the estate.
Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the
valuers are illustrated below:

**15** **Impairment testing**

**Property, plant and equipment**

For leasehold properties not included in the valuation the Group considers each of these individual pubs as a cashgenerating unit (CGU). At 24 September 2023 785 pubs were included in leasehold properties, of which seven are
non-trading sites. Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment, and impairment reversals for
previously impaired CGUs. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is
compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the higher of the value in use
and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date
for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

Value in use calculations use forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax
discount rate of 14.0% (2022: 14.9%). The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within
the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and
the cost of equity by using an average of market risk premiums and Company betas at the period end date and a
CGU specific risk premium has been applied.

Where fair value has been used this is deemed to be a higher value than a value in use calculation amount. External
valuations have been used for this purpose, carried out by Avison Young (UK) Limited, independent Chartered
Surveyors. The fair value of property assets held in property, plant and equipment was derived using fair
maintainable trade income (FMT) multiplied by an appropriate rate of return (as defined within RICS Valuation –
Global Standard) or an equivalent multiple. This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair
maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run
by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future trading potential. An appropriate multiple is then
applied to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider
evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings
and any fixed landlord’s fixtures and fittings. The fair value of managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent
approach involving the net income attributable to the Group from operating the pub at an appropriate multiple.

All classes of asset, where fair value has been used, are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best
use. IFRS 13 prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or
other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing
their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be
reflected in the fair value where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate
that there may be a higher and better use. In the current period the highest and best use of all the property assets
in property, plant and equipment and investment property has been assessed as their existing use.

Impairments totalling £27 million (2022: £199 million) and impairment reversals of £28 million (2022: £55 million)
were identified within property, plant and equipment.

**Sensitivity analysis – property, plant and equipment**

Value in use calculations are most sensitive to forecast cash flow changes, such that if the forecast cash flows were
to decrease by 5% the impairment charge would increase by £1 million.

**15** **Impairment testing (continued)**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. The Group considers each of its
operating segments as a cash-generating unit (CGU) for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The carrying
amount of goodwill allocated to each operating segment as described in note 2 at the period end and the movements
during the period is as follows:

**Total net book**


**Pub Partners** **Craft Union** **Stonegate**


**value**


**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

26 September 2021 46 17 179 242

Disposals - - (2) (2)

Impairment - - (178) (178)

**24 September 2023** **-** **17** **-** **17**

Within these segments the goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment
to the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The assumptions and inputs for each segment’s goodwill test is set out in the following table. Key assumptions have
been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes
in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable. The key
driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the best publicans, formats
and pub operators, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The discount rate used is based
on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC) which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors
which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC
management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of market risk premiums
and Company betas at the period end date.

£178 million of Stonegate impairment was identified in the current period driven by lower expected future cashflows
and growth rates. In the prior period impairments totalling £44 million were recognised in the Pub Partners segment
which was driven by a higher than expected discount rate of 13.6% at 25 September 2022 as a result of uncertain
market conditions.

No reasonable changes to the above assumptions would lead to an impairment in the Craft Union cash generating
unit.

The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

Trade, other receivables and amounts due from group undertakings – these are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.

Cash and cash equivalents - approximate to the carrying amounts stated in the accounts.

Trade, other payables and amounts due to group undertakings - these are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.

Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

Long term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying
amount in the case of the senior term loan and second lien facility.

Lease liabilities – the fair value of obligations under lease liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows
using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Derivatives – these are carried at fair value.

The Group’s financial instruments consist of securitised loan notes, bank and other borrowings and cash, the main
purpose of which is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group’s other financial instruments, such as
trade receivables and payables, arise directly from its operations.

IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source
of inputs used to derive fair value.

The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:

  - Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

  - Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair values of the senior secured notes; privately places notes and euro floating rate notes are measured at
market price and are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Group’s
securitised bonds; second lien facility and bank loans and overdrafts are deemed to be level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy. All other financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a level 2 valuation method.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows:

**24 September** 25 September

**2023** 2022

**£m** £m

**Cross currency interest rate swaps**
Current assets **-** (2)

Non-current liabilities **24** 
**24** (2)

The interest rate swaps replace the Euribor currency and floating rate on the Group’s €496 million floating rate loan
notes with a fixed rate. The Group has chosen not to apply hedge accounting for its interest rate swap given the
additional costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IFRS 9. Consequently, movements in fair
value are recognised in the income statement.

During the period the Group has agreed new cross currency interest rate swaps to replace all of the €496 million
hedged due to expire at the end of July 2023 and September 2023. Of the €496 million agreed €222 million is fixed
at an average interest rate of 12% and the remainder is at a floating rate of SONIA + an average spread of 6.203%.
These expire September 2024.

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, issued share capital and reserves. These are managed effectively to
minimise the Group’s cost of capital, to add value to shareholders and to service debt obligations. The securitised
debt is monitored by a variety of measures, which are reported to the debt providers on a quarterly basis. The Group
assesses the performance of the business, the level of available funds and the short to medium term strategic plans
concerning capital spend as well as the need to meet financial covenants and such assessment influences the level
of dividends payable.

The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk and credit
risk. The policy for managing each of the Group’s risks is set out as follows.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group seeks
to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs by regular cash flow
forecasting and reporting; monitoring of the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds
and maintenance of undrawn bank facilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s debt
based on contractual, undiscounted cash flows including interest.

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Interest rate risk**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of trading cash, bank overdraft facilities and fixed and floating
secured loan notes and bonds. The Group’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This
exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates for a large proportion of its debt, being the securitised bonds; the
senior secured notes and the privately placed notes.

At the balance sheet date the Group’s variable rate instruments comprised euro floating rate notes for which the
Group manages the impact of interest rate fluctuations by using cross currency interest rate swaps to manage
exposure and replace the floating rate with a fixed rate of interest, and the second lien facility which charges interest
at SONIA + 8.50%. The Group also faces interest rate risk from its revolving credit facility but due to the nature of
short-term drawings any interest rate risk is considered to be minimal.

The Group therefore predominately faces interest rate risk from the second lien facility. A 1% interest rate increase
would result in an increase to interest charged to the income statement of £4 million (2022: £4 million) and a
corresponding decrease in equity. This is assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was
outstanding for the whole period.

**Security**

The revolving credit facility; senior secured notes; privately placed notes; euro floating notes and second lien facility
borrowings are governed by debentures pursuant to English law incorporating customary fixed and floating charge
security over the assets of the charging companies being Stonegate Pub Company Limited and certain of its
subsidiaries, deemed the Restricted Group, and Cayman Islands law governed equitable share mortgages over the
shares of Stonegate Pub Company Limited and certain other members of the Restricted Group incorporated under
the laws of the Cayman Islands.

Unique Pub Properties Limited is not deemed a Restricted Subsidiary as its assets are secured by way of a fixed
charge for the benefit of its bond holders within its securitisation structure. The security pledged for the securitised
bonds is collectively over the whole securitisation incorporating a first fixed charge in favour of the Trustee over the
Issuer’s right (The Unique Pub Finance Company plc), title, interest and benefit, present and future to all properties,
cash, eligible investments and income generated by Unique Pub Properties Limited.

The total value of assets within the Group secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 24 September 2023 is
property, plant and equipment £3,555 million (2022: £2,886 million), investment property £217 million (2022: £181
million) and non-current assets held for sale £31 million (2022: £16 million).

**Notes (continued)**

**23** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Covenants**

The Group is subject to a number of financial covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities. There are three
covenants that relate to the debt as follows:

Two of the covenants relate to the securitised bonds and are tested and reported at each quarter end. The Debt
Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) measures the ability of the securitised group to meet its debt service whilst the Net Worth
covenant in the securitised group must be at least £300 million. The Group has met both covenants during the
financial year.

The one other covenant relates to the RCF. This comprises a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio that is tested quarterly
whilst the RCF is more than 40% drawn. The Group met this covenant during the year. At the period end £160 million
of the RCF was drawn and due to be repaid or rolled within one month. The Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio was
tested and comfortably met. At 25 September 2022 £70 million of the RCF was drawn and due to be repaid or rolled
within one month. Throughout the prior period at the quarterly testing dates the amount drawn was below the 40%
testing threshold therefore no covenant test was required and the amount was included in non-current liabilities.

**Currency risk**
All of the revenues and the majority of the costs of the Group are in sterling. The Group uses cross currency interest
rate swaps to manage exposure to the impact of currency risk from its debt denominated in euros.

**Credit risk**

The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an expected credit loss (ECL)
provision. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure the expected lifetime credit losses
on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic bad debt experience to create an
ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the reporting date. The Group writes off its
trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the debt. The carrying amount of financial
assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

The ageing of trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date, net of the doubtful debt provision, is as follows:

**24 September** 25 September

**£m** £m

Not past due **58** 42

_Impacts for the period_

The Group follows the same basis of categorisation to both free hold property and leasehold property to determine
where to present assets on the balance sheet and therefore right of use assets are recognised in investment
property, non-current assets held for sale and property, plant and equipment depending on the type of sub lease
(where it is sub let) or the commitment to dispose of the property/lease. The following table sets out the movement
in the Group’s right-of-use assets during the period and the carrying value at 24 September 2023:

The practical expedient has been applied to all lease contracts where the rent concessions have met the conditions
per IFRS 16.46.

In relation to those leases under IFRS 16, for the 52 weeks ending 24 September 2023, the Group’s operating profit
metric improved by £21 million (2022: £16 million) as the new depreciation expense is lower than the IAS 17
operating lease charge; however net finance costs are higher than this, at £48 million (2022: £49 million), such that
net profit after tax is lower (2022: lower) compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis. Operating profit before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment and loss on sale of non-current assets is higher (2022: higher) compared to
the previous IAS 17 reporting basis.

**Leases as a lessor**

The Group leases a proportion of its properties to tenants. The majority of lease agreements have terms of between
one and 30 years, most of the leases with terms of over three years include RPI or CPI base rent adjustments and
provisions for rent reviews on either a three year or five year basis. Where the Group is the intermediate lessor the
sublease is classified as a finance lease by reference to the right of use asset, all other leases are classified as
operating leases.

**_Defined contribution pension schemes_**

The Group operates three defined contribution stakeholder schemes for certain employees. The pension cost charge
for the period represents contributions payable by the Group to the schemes and amounted to £7 million (2022: £6
million) At the period end the Group had outstanding contributions payable to the schemes of £1 million (2022: £1
million).

**_Defined benefit pension schemes_**

On 21 June 2011, as part of the Plato Company 3 acquisition the Group acquired two defined benefit schemes, the
Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension scheme, which are closed to new members and closed to
further accruals for existing members. The assets of the schemes are held in single, separate trustee administered
funds.

A full actuarial valuation for the Laurel Pub Pension scheme was carried out as at 29 February 2020. For the purposes
of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 29 February 2020, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary,
has been updated on an approximate basis to 24 September 2023.

A full actuarial valuation for the Yates Group Pension scheme was carried out as at 29 February 2020. For the
purposes of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 29 February 2020, which was carried out by a qualified independent
actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 24 September 2023.

The following tables illustrate the impact of both the Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension
scheme on the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (SOCI) and
the consolidated balance sheet.

The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:

**24 September** 25 September

Surplus in the scheme **1** 1

Effect of asset ceiling **-** 
**Net retirement benefit surplus recognised in the balance sheet** **1** 1

**Total net retirement benefit recognised in the balance sheet** **(7)** (8)

As the Group has concluded there is no unconditional right to a surplus on wind up, the net deficit on the Laurel Pub
Pension scheme has been recognised at the present value of minimum funding requirements.

At the end of the life of the Yates Group Pension scheme, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund and
any such refund would be paid out only on a net of tax basis.

The Group has agreed with the trustees of the Laurel Pub Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by
the payment of annual contributions of £2 million each year until 2027. The Group will meet the other annual fees
and expenses (excluding the annual PPF levy) incurred by the scheme subject to a cap of £270,000 per scheme year.

The full actuarial valuation of the Yates Group Pension scheme showed a deficit of £3 million. The Group has agreed
with the trustees of the Yates Group Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by the payment of annual
contributions of £500,000 per annum.

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on

Pension scheme (2022: 14 years) and 10 years for the Yates Group Pension scheme (2022: 11 years).

The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and
longevity risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result
in an increase to plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to
increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of
the plan’s bond holdings. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the Yates Group Pension
scheme against extreme inflation.

_Other related party transactions_

Included in amounts due from parent undertakings is a balance of £1 million owing from Stonegate Pub Company
Pikco Limited, a parent undertaking (2022: £1 million).

There is an amount of £2 million (2021: £2 million) owing to Stonegate Pub Company Midco Limited, the immediate
parent company, at 25 September 2022, which is included in trade and other payables.

During the period the Group was invoiced management charges of £2 million (2022: £5 million which includes
invoices for 2021 when none were invoiced) by TDR Capital LLP. The amount outstanding at 24 September 2023 was
£Nil (2022: £Nil).

The Group also operated a handful of public houses on behalf of entities affiliated with investment funds managed
by TDR Capital LLP, known as Cubitt House Limited. The balance owing as a result of transactions on its behalf at 24
September 2023 was £47,000 (2022: £163,000).

In a prior period Stonegate Pub Company Limited provided a loan to Stonegate Pub Company Holdings Limited, a
parent undertaking. The loan is repayable on demand and charges annual interest of SONIA + 2.50%. The amount
owed of £7 million is included in trade and other receivables (2022: £7 million).

Included in amounts due from group undertakings is £5 million (2022: £4 million) due in more than one year. On 13
June 2022, Stonegate Pub Company provided a £4 million loan to Stonegate Pub Company Kitchens Limited, a
company under common control of the ultimate parent company, Stonegate Pub Company Topco Sarl, a company
incorporated in Luxembourg. The loan charges interest at a rate of 8.5% and expires in 2029.

**Notes (continued)**

**30** **Management Incentive Plan**

During the period ended 29 September 2019; the Group established a management incentive plan to reward certain
employees, including directors and managers, for their future service. Under the plan those employees will realise a
gain only if there is a growth in the equity value of the business (subject to certain ‘ratchets’) and only if an exit event
occurs. The award has been classified as equity-settled. An exit event would occur either upon an initial public
offering of the Stonegate group (‘IPO’) or some other form of sale (e.g. to a trade buyer). The fair value of the scheme
at grant date was not considered to be material.

On 8 January 2021 the scheme was replaced with a new management incentive plan so that it also included certain
legacy EIG employees and new Stonegate employees, alongside a change to the quantum of returns at an exit event
following the acquisition of EI Group. The scheme is operated by the Group’s ultimate owners and was established
through subscription to shares in the Group’s parent company, Stonegate Pub Company Holdings Limited.

In the prior period in order to determine the fair value at the date of modification, Management engaged a third
party to value the MIP immediately before and after the modification. The value, determined using a Monte Carlo
simulation, at the date of modification was an uplift of £2.1 million for new members and £2.8 million for the change
in return parameters. No dividends will accrue under this award.

There is inherent uncertainty in determining a suitable vesting period given that an exit event, whilst within the
control of the Group’s ultimate owners, may not happen for many years if at all. However, for the purposes of
considering the impact of IFRS 2, the directors have used a vesting period of 5 years. As a result, a charge of £1
million (2022: £1 million) has been recognised as an equity settled share based payment expense in the income
statement.

There are no other share based payment schemes.

**31** **Ultimate parent undertaking**

The ultimate parent company is Stonegate Pub Company Topco Sarl, a company incorporated in Luxembourg. The
ultimate controlling party is TDR Capital Stonegate L.P., an investment fund managed by TDR Capital LLP, a private
equity management firm.

**32** **Post balance sheet events**

Subsequent to the year end on 20 December 2023 the Group committed to a limited recourse financing structure
over a portfolio of 1,034 of its freehold pubs in order to raise a principal amount of £638 million. The portfolio
comprises 944 leased and tenanted and 90 free-of-tie freehold pubs. The portfolio will be acquired by newly
incorporated, wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiaries of Stonegate Pub Company Limited (“New PubCos”). As part
of the transaction, Stonegate will enter into agreements with New PubCos on an arm’s length basis to provide the
Portfolio with certain management and procurement services. Completion is expected in January 2024 at which
point the Group will receive £609 million cash proceeds from third party financing providers, which is net of a funded
interest reserve, arrangement fees and other expenses. The loan matures five years post-closing and accrues interest
at three month SONIA (floored at 2.5%) plus 6.35%, which is cash settled quarterly. The newly financed portfolio will
continue to be consolidated within the Group financial statements.

Furthermore, subsequent to the period end the Group has agreed a settlement with insurance providers over Covid19 business interruption losses.

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements**

The directors of Stonegate Pub Company Limited ('the directors') have accepted responsibility for the preparation
of the Strategic report, Director’s report and non-statutory Group accounts for the period ended 25 September 2022
which are intended by them to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss
for that period. They have decided to prepare the non-statutory Group accounts in accordance with UK-adopted
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and applicable Cayman Island company law. In preparing these
non-statutory Group accounts, the directors have:

- selected suitable accounting policies and applied them consistently;

- made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- stated whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, UK-adopted international accounting standards;

- assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

concern; and

- used the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations,

or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
non-statutory Group accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

 23 January 2023

 Dear Directors


#### Independent auditor’s report to Stonegate Pub Company Limited (“the Company”) 

 Opinion 

 We have audited the financial statements of Stonegate Pub Company Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”) for the 52 week period ended 25 September 2022 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1. These financial statements have been prepared for the reasons set out in note 1. 

 In our opinion the financial statements: 

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 25 September 2022
#### and of the Group’s loss for the period then ended; and 

- have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting

#### standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Law (2013 Revision) of the Cayman Islands.

 Basis for opinion 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and the terms of our engagement letter dated 16 January 2020. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

#### Material uncertainty related to going concern

 We draw attention to note 1.2 to the financial statements which describes the uncertain trading environment facing the Group and the need, in a severe but plausible downside scenario, to obtain additional funding and to negotiate covenant waivers with lenders.  These events and conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 1.2, constitute a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

 Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

 Going concern basis of preparation

 The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis. As stated above, they have concluded that a material uncertainty related to going concern exists.

 Our conclusion based on our financial statements audit work: we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

 Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – ability to detect

 Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

 To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

- Enquiring of directors, internal audit and members of the Operational Board and
#### inspection of policy documentation as to the wider Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the wider Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.

- Reading Board meeting minutes.

- Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.

#### We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.

 As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates such as impairment of property, plant and equipment and valuation of investment property. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because within pub revenue the risk arising from site level fraud is limited due to the size of the estate and number of individual sites, and in relation to rental

**_KPMG LLP_**

_23 January 2023_

#### income each tenant has a signed contractual agreement that billing and collection is based on.

 We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

 In determining the audit procedures, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of some of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.

 We also performed procedures including: 

- Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified
#### entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management and those posted to unusual accounts. 

- Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are
#### indicative of a potential bias.

 Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations

 We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, and through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. 

 We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit 

 The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

 Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. 

 Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, data protection, anti-bribery, employment law, and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to

_23 January 2023_

#### enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.

 Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

 Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. 

 In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

 Other information

 The directors are responsible for the other information, which comprises the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover these reports and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

 Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work, we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 

 Directors’ responsibilities 

 As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 18, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements, which are intended by them to give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

 Auditor’s responsibilities 

 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK)

 A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1** **Accounting policies**

Stonegate Pub Company Limited (the “Company”) is governed by Cayman Island Company Law and is limited by
shares.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
“Group”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Companies Law (2013
Revision) of the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands do not have prescribed accounting standards, the Group has
elected to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards (“UK-adopted IFRS”), as allowed under Cayman Island Company Law.

There is no statutory requirement for accounts to be audited in the UK; however, these accounts are being prepared
and subject to a non-statutory audit for the purpose of filing accounts of the UK branch of this overseas Group and
formally setting out the financial performance and position of the Group.

No parent company information is presented in these consolidated financial statements, Companies Law (2013
Revision) in the Cayman Islands does not require such information to be presented. The parent company information
has been prepared under FRS 102. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Prior period adjustment**

A prior period restatement has been recorded to correct the mapping of a consolidation journal in the prior period.
The impact of the correction for the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2021 is a reduction to pre-exceptional revenue
of £7 million to £707 million and a reduction to pre-exceptional operating costs of £7 million to £658 million. There
is no net impact on EBITDA or on any other primary statements.

**1.1** **Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are
stated at their fair value: financial liabilities (including derivatives) measured at fair value and investment property.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**1.2** **Going concern**

The macroeconomic environment continues to have a significant impact on the Group. Although the impact of
COVID-19 has lessened more recently, the cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom has led to lower profit and
operating cashflows than would otherwise have resulted had these conditions not existed.

The financial position of the Group is set out in the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 21 which shows net assets
of £109 million (2021: £237 million). During the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2022 the Group has experienced a
net cash outflow of £91 million (52 weeks ended 26 September 2021: net cash outflow of £70 million) which was
driven by all debts that were held during Covid-19 closure periods now having been repaid and the negative impact
the Omicron variant had on the festive trading period in December 2021.

The Group has continued to meet its day-to-day working capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of
cash generation when sites are open, charging and collecting rents from publicans and its overdraft facility of £25
million and revolving credit facility of £198 million. The continued availability of the revolving credit facility is subject
to compliance with covenants (see note 22). The Directors consider that this is a normal feature of trading in this
industry. In the managed business, customers pay by cash or card at the point of sale, resulting in minimal credit
risk, whilst in the leased and tenanted business, the Group has a dedicated credit control function, who are able to
manage the credit risk exposure. The Group typically operates with net current liabilities (25 September 2022: £251
million; 26 September 2021: £250 million net current liabilities).

**1.2** **Going concern (continued)**

At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt totalling £3,121 million (26 September 2021:
£3,222 million), of which an amount of £534 million related to the Unique securitisation is subject to covenants that
are tested quarterly and, if breached, would result in the debt becoming repayable on demand. The Group was
compliant with all covenants both at the year end and the December 2022 test dates. Details of the debt facilities
are set out in note 22.

The Board have reviewed the cash flow forecasts for the Group for the period through to July 2024 (“the going
concern assessment period”). This period incorporates at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial
statements and incorporates the semi-annual interest payment due in July 2024.

The base case forecasts reviewed by the Board reflect levels of trade across the Group in line with pre-Covid levels,
sales price increases below inflation, labour cost rises to ensure the Group remains paying at least National Living
Wage and certain out of contract cost price increases. Utilities are assumed to be double the level of the prior year
as the Group’s fixed price contract ended. These forecasts also assume that the Group scales back its conversion
and expansionary capital expenditure program in order to prudently preserve cash to deal with cost headwinds.
These forecasts remove £55 million of anticipated capital expenditure during FY23. The base case also assumes that
the £23 million of RCF tranche due to expire in July 2023 is extended for at least another year, in line with the position
previously agreed with lenders.

As well as the base case forecasts indicating that there is sufficient liquidity in the Group, the forecasts also indicate
that there are no breaches to covenants within either the Group’s revolving credit facility nor the Unique
securitisation.

The Board has also considered a severe but plausible scenario incorporating a 5% reduction in retail sales volumes
from the cost-of-living crisis within its Managed and Operator-led segments and an additional 50% increase in utility
costs from part-way through FY24. It has been assumed that variable costs move in line with the reduction in sales.

The severe but plausible forecasts indicate that the Group would require additional funding in July/August 2023 and
January/February 2024 in order to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due.

In addition, the severe but plausible forecasts indicate a breach in the RCF covenant at the July 2023 test date
resulting in the facility becoming repayable on demand.  The Group currently has no plans to negotiate any further
waivers with the RCF lenders, but if it needed to, they have been supportive already and the Directors are confident
they would be supportive again if required. In the absence of such waivers, the directors are confident that they
could employ appropriate mitigating actions, such as scaling back the capital expenditure program further.
However, the Group would nonetheless require additional funding even if mitigating actions within its control were
implemented.

Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going
concern basis. However, the future uncertain trading environment, the need in the base case to renew £23 million
of the RCF and, in downside scenarios, the availability of additional funding and the agreement of lenders to further
waivers of RCF covenant breaches indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern assessment period, and therefore that the
Group may be unable to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business. These
financial statements do not contain the adjustments that would result if the Group were unable to continue as a
going concern.

**1.3** **Basis of consolidation**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights. The acquisition date
is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s
equity in those subsidiaries. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests.

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated.

**1.4** **Financial instruments**

_Recognition and initial measurement_

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they originate. All other financial assets
and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is
initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), transaction costs
that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component
is initially measured at the transaction price.

**_Classification and subsequent measurement_**

**_Financial assets_**

_(a)_ _Classification_

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other
comprehensive income (‘’FVOCI’’) – debt investment; FVOCI – equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not
reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period
following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and
selling financial assets; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present
subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment
basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.
This includes all derivative financial assets.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.4** **Financial instruments (continued)**

_(b)_ _Subsequent measurement and gains and losses_

_Financial assets at FVTPL - these assets (other than derivatives designated as hedging instruments) are subsequently_
measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or
loss.

_Financial assets at amortised cost - These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective_
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and
losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or
loss.

_Debt investments at FVOCI - these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using_
the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are
reclassified to profit or loss.

_Equity investments at FVOCI - these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as_
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other
net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

**_Financial liabilities and equity_**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two
conditions:

(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments
or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial
assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Group’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial
statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL
if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial
liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised
in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.

**Notes (continued)**

**1.4** **Financial instruments (continued)**

When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing
financial liability. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability
or as a substantial modification, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the
extinguishment and written off through non-underlying finance costs and the new borrowings are recognised at fair
value. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a non-substantial modification, a gain or loss is recognised
at the time of the non-substantial modification (to the extent that there is a change in the expected amount or
timing of payments of interest and principal). The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the present
value of the cash flows (excluding fees) under the original and modified terms discounted at the original effective
interest rate. Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the
remaining life of the modified loan.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**1.5** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

  - right-of-use assets are depreciated over their lease lives;

  - freehold properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values over 50 years;

  - leasehold properties and improvements are depreciated over the shortest of 50 years, their estimated
useful lives and their remaining lease periods;

  - long-life landlords’ fixtures and fittings are depreciated over 5 to 30 years;

  - retail, administration and short-life landlords’ furniture, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated
over 3 to 15 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

The Group capitalises employment costs and related personal expenses of individuals whose job roles are
fundamentally associated with managing or implementing the Group’s capital development programme. Judgement
is therefore applied in determining the element of internal labour costs which are directly attributable to capital
projects. Where such an individual undertakes non-capital expenditure related activities as part of their job roles
then a proportion of their cost is not capitalised unless the non-capital expenditure related activities are incidental
to their role.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.6** **Investment property**

The Group leases some properties on commercial leases within the Commercial Properties segment. The commercial
terms of these leases result in the assets meeting the criteria of investment property.

Properties held as investment property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet
date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external
valuers.

Transfers are made to/from investment property when there is change of use evidenced by a change in the lease
terms. When a property transfers from property, plant and equipment to investment property, and vice versa, it is
revalued to fair value and the movement recognised in the income statement.

**1.7** **Non-current assets held for sale**

Properties identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are
held at the lower of carrying value on transfer to non-current assets held for sale, as assessed at the time of transfer,
and fair value less costs to dispose. The fair value less costs to dispose is based on the net estimated realisable
disposal proceeds (ERV) which is derived from internal valuations when the property is transferred to non-current
assets held for sale and then sense checked with third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the
properties.

Licensed land and buildings, investment property and right-of-use assets are classified as held for sale when they
have been identified for disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition
and the sale should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the
property or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Licensed land and buildings
held for sale are not depreciated and right of use assets held for sale are not amortised.

Profits or losses on disposal of property are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal.

**1.8** **Business combinations**

Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition
method. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

_Acquisitions post transition date_

For acquisitions on or after 26 September 2011, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

  - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

  - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, if any; plus

  - the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

  - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed
as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise,
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

**Notes (continued)**

**1.9** **Intangible assets and goodwill**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is stated at cost less
any impairment. At 25 September 2022 the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments described in note
2. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the
Group’s operating segments. As properties move between segments the associated goodwill will also be transferred.

_Brand_

Brand intangible assets recognised on acquisition are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 10 years.

**1.10** **Leases**

_As a lessee_

The Group leases properties and vehicles.

At the inception of a contract the Group assesses whether that contract is or contains a lease. This is the case if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

The Group has elected not to apply the lessee requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases and leases for which the
underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments for such leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

For all other leases where it is the lessee the Group recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use asset at the
commencement date of the lease.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments at commencement date,
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The carrying amount of the lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and
decreased by lease payments made.

The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index
rate or, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as
appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be
exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

For rent concessions in leases the Group assesses whether there is a lease modification. The lease liability is then remeasured at the present value of the revised lease payments at the modification date, discounted using the interest
rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The
change in the present value of the lease liability is accounted for as an increase to the right-of-use asset where it
relates to a future change, with any element relating to a past payment dated before the modification date
accounted for in the income statement.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.10** **Leases (continued)**

The right-of-use asset is recognised at an amount equal to the total of the lease liability, any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs and the estimated future dismantling, removal and site
restoration costs. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in
‘property, plant and equipment’, the same line item as it presents underlying assets of the same nature that it owns.

Right-of-use assets included in property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost, and subsequently at
cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurements or
modifications of the lease liability. Where the right-of-use asset is in relation to an investment property it is initially
measured at cost, and subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Where a property held on lease transfers from PPE to investment property the right of use asset is revalued to fair
value before transfer.

_As a lessor_

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration
in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone price. When the Group acts as a
lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease;
if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether
the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease,
not with reference to the underlying asset.

Where a property that is leased is re-leased to a third party and that sub-lease is categorised as a finance lease the
right of use asset is derecognised and it is replaced by a financial asset being the net investment in that sublease.
The net investment in the sub-lease is calculated as the net present value of the future rent payments receivable at
the interest rate implicit in the sub-lease or, if that cannot be readily determined, at the discount rate used for the
head lease.

The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The
Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in
the lease.

The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the
lease term as part of revenue.

_Leases acquired in a business combination_

For leases acquired in a business combination, the Group measures the acquired lease liability at the present value
of the remaining lease payments, as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. The right-of-use
asset is measured at acquisition at the same amount as the lease liability, adjusted to reflect favourable or
unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.11** **Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
less any costs of disposal. Cost is calculated using the first in first out method.

**1.12** **Trade receivables and trade payables**

Trade receivables are held at their original invoiced amount net of an Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) allowance based
on the simplified model as allowed by IFRS 9. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure
the expected lifetime credit losses on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic
bad debt experience to create an ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the
reporting date. The Group writes off its trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the
debt.

Trade payables are held at amortised cost.

**1.13** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents
for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.

**1.14** **Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

_Financial assets (including receivables)_

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates
that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect
on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between
its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original
effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the
discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment
loss is reversed through profit or loss.

_Non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment or impairment
reversals. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible
assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated
each year at the same time.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped
together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.14** **Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets (continued)**

The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each CGU is reviewed for impairment if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or for impairment
reversals. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. Where fair value is used
this is based on known sales proceeds or an external valuation. Any changes in outlet earnings or cash flows, the
discount rate applied to those cash flows and fair value could give rise to an additional impairment loss.

The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill
to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is
monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments. The recoverable amount of the
CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require
estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying
amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised
in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had
been recognised. The reversal is recognised in the income statement.

**1.15** **Employee benefits**

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net
obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit
is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The
Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit
liability/asset.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity
dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the
benefits are expected to be paid. Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest).
The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined
benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.15** **Employee benefits (continued)**

When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to
past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the
plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified
actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised
asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.

The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The
gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being
settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and
any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past
service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

_Share-based payment transactions_

Where the Group or Company’s parent grants rights to its equity instruments to this Group or Company’s employees,
which are accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated accounts of the parent, the Group or Company as the
case may be account for these share-based payments as equity-settled. As the shares to be given to the employees
are not the Group or Company’s own equity instruments and have been effectively paid for by the parent entity, the
Group or Company recognises a share-based payment expense in its income statement and an associated capital
contribution in equity from its parent.

The fair value of share-based payments awards at the date of grant is recognised as an employee expense, with a
corresponding increase in equity as stated above, over the period that the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the awards. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking
into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.16** **Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, that can be reliably measured, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax discount rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

A provision for onerous leases is made for non-trading sites closure costs.

**1.17** **Revenue**

Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal
course of business, net of discounts and VAT. Revenue from drink and food is recognised at the point at which the
goods are provided. Property rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.

**Leased and tenanted**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from the supply of drink products to publicans and revenue is recognised_
at the point of delivery to the pub at which point physical possession is passed and the publican takes control of the
product, obtaining the significant risks and rewards of ownership. The proceeds from the sale are recognised as
revenue.

_Rent revenue – Rent revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease based on the contractual_

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.18** **Government Grants**

Money received in the form of a government grant is treated as revenue. Therefore, grant income is recorded within
other income in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods as the related expenses are
incurred.

**1.19** **Supplier incentives**

Supplier incentives and rebates are recognised within operating costs as they are earned. The accrued value at the
reporting date is included in trade and other receivables.

**1.20** **Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
periods.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided
for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**1.21** **Exceptional items**

The Group presents separately on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense
which are outside of the normal course of trading, which management consider will distort comparability, in order
to provide a trend measure of underlying performance. This includes the profit / (loss) on sale of property,
movements in the valuation of investment properties and the impairment of property, plant and equipment and
goodwill which do not directly result from the underlying trading performance of the Group and are not in their
direct control, and therefore have been categorised as exceptional items. These costs are discussed further in note
8.

**1.22** **Key accounting judgements and estimates**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses during the period.

Management periodically evaluates its estimates and judgements and bases them on historical experience and other
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

**Key accounting judgements**

The following are the key judgements, apart from those involving estimations, dealt with separately below, that
management have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and which have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.22** **Key accounting judgements and estimates (continued)**

_Exceptional items_

During the period certain items are identified and separately disclosed as exceptional. Judgement is applied as to
whether the item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed. This assessment covers the
nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that item on reported performance. Note 8
provides information on all of the items disclosed as exceptional in the current and previous period.

_Going concern_

The directors exercise judgement when concluding on going concern as the basis of preparation of the financial
statements. For further details see note 1.2.

**Key areas of estimation**

The following are the key areas of estimation uncertainty that may have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements.

_Impairment of property, plant, equipment_

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and fair
values. Where fair values have been used these are derived from known sales proceeds or an external valuation.
Estimates and assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are discussed in note 14.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are also assessed for any indications that the loss has decreased or no
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. Impairment is discussed further in note 14.

_Impairment of goodwill_

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may be impaired. Estimates and assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are
discussed in note 14.

_Valuation of investment properties_

Properties held as investment property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet
date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external
valuers.

Investment properties are valued annually to fair value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual
published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and IFRS 13. The valuation is based on an assessment
of the income generating potential of the properties and applying an appropriate multiple. The highest and best use
for the property assets is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally due to the legal restrictions

**1.22** **Key accounting judgements and estimates (continued)**

imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial implications of a change of use
given those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However, consideration is given to an alternative highest
and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists which is physically possible, legally
permissible and financially feasible to access. Further information about the valuation of investment properties is
provided in note 11 of these financial statements.

The valuation methodology uses an estimation of the fair maintainable trade (FMT) of a property and then applies
a multiple. The FMT is estimated based on historic trends and projected future income whilst the multiples are
determined by our valuers with reference to each specific asset and market information. For more detail on the FMT
and multiples see note 11.

**1.23** **New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group**

The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards are mandatory for the Group for the
first time for the annual reporting period commencing 27 September 2021.

- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)

- Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendment to IFRS 16)

**Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16**

The Phase 2 amendments provide practical relief from certain requirements in the standards. When the basis for
determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument is changed as a direct consequence of interest rate
benchmark reform and is made on an economically equivalent basis, the Phase 2 amendments provide a practical
expedient to update the effective interest rate of a financial instrument before applying the existing requirements
in the standards. The group has no variable lease payments that are linked to LIBOR.

**COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendment to IFRS 16)**

The amendment extends the optional practical expedient for lessees not to treat eligible rent concessions that are
a direct consequence of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic as lease modifications until 30 June 2022.

**1.24** **Adopted IFRS not yet applied**

The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:

  - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective from 1 January 2022).

  - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3 (effective from 1 January 2022).

  - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use (effective from 1
January 2022).

  - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective from 1 January 2022).

  - Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to introduce a new
definition for accounting estimates (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statements 2 Making
Materiality Judgements (effective from 1 January 2023).

  - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single
Transaction (effective from 1 January 2023).

**Notes (continued)**

**2** **Segmental reporting**

The directors determine the appropriate operating segments based on the discrete management information
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).

The Group has six distinguishable revenue generating operating segments being Pub Partners, Commercial Property,
Stonegate, Craft Union, Joint Ventures and Vixen, and the CODM reviews discrete information on these segments.
These have been aggregated into three reportable segments as outlined below:

1) Leased and tenanted comprising Pub Partners and Commercial Property – The Group receives rental income from
leasing these sites to third parties. Revenue is also received from tied sites within Pub Partners for the supply of
drinks and gaming machines. The Group has no direct involvement in the operation of each site.

2) Managed comprising Stonegate and Joint Ventures – The Group generates revenue from the sale of food, drink,
admission, accommodation and gaming machine income. Each site is fully managed by the Group, such that the
Group is exposed to all operational risks and in return receives the full retail margin.

3) Operator-led comprising Craft Union and Vixen – The Group receives revenue from the sale of food, drink,
admission and gaming machine income. The Group contracts with an operating company to manage the day-to-day
operations of the site for which they receive a turnover-based fee. All labour costs are borne by the operating
company, with all other costs being borne by the Group. The Group has access to the full retail margin.

Central costs represent certain head office expenses which are not attributable to specific segments. Accordingly,
these costs are disclosed as a separate column within the segmental notes.

The CODM reviews the financial results by segment to EBITDA, which represents operating profit / (loss) before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment, revaluation, and profit on sale of non-current assets, and this therefore
provides the basis for the disclosures below. Inter-segment revenues and costs are eliminated upon consolidation
such that all numbers disclosed in the table below are with external customers.

All of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is not further segmented based on location,
therefore no geographical segmental analysis has been provided. The balance sheet is not reviewed by the CODM
on a segmented basis and therefore no disclosure has been made in relation to segmental assets and liabilities.

premiums were paid to publicans in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other
than at renewal. Following the acquisition of Ei Group Limited, the Group are looking to review the entire portfolio
of assets and move pubs across segments into their perceived optimum operating format. This one-off process is
likely to take five years, during which time any assignment premiums paid will be shown as exceptional.

**Other costs: Other costs include £1 million of Covid-19-related landlord renegotiation costs. In the 52 weeks ended**

**Impairment of goodwill:** Impairment of £44 million was recognised in the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2022
(2021: £Nil). Further details of this impairment charge can be found in note 14.

**Profit on sale of non-current assets: 69 properties (2021: 110 properties) and various other plots of land with a book**
value of £46 million (2021: £65 million) and lease liability value of £8 million (2021: £4 million) were disposed of
generating net proceeds of £46 million (2021: £66 million) after taking account of disposal costs. In accordance with
IAS 36, £1 million (2021: £1 million) of goodwill was allocated to these disposals. Included in these disposals were
two sites which were required to be disposed under the CMA guidelines following the acquisition of Ei Group Limited
in March 2020 (two completed in the current period and 40 completed in the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2021).
Also included in the profit on disposal was a charge for estimated dilapidation costs for certain properties of £1
million (2020: £Nil). This resulted in an overall profit of £6 million (2021: £4 million included in pre-exceptional
items).

**Net finance income: Included in the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2022 £1 million of interest was received from**
HMRC in relation to a repayment. A net finance gain of £9 million was recognised in the 52 weeks ended 26
September 2021. During the 52 week period ended 26 September 2021 the Group carried out a number of financing
events which resulted in a gain of £11 million. Also included in finance costs in the 52 weeks ended 26 September
2021 are £2 million of fees related to an aborted refinancing project.

Properties held as investment property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet
date. Investment properties include free-of-tie pubs let to tenants at open market rents and non-pub assets, which
are predominantly blue-chip let convenience stores. These assets have been valued adopting the investment
method of valuation. By reference to the rents, fixed lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple
based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value.
Valuations are carried out on an annual basis at each period end date. The Group’s properties were valued as at 25
September 2022 by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a Avison Young) and Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP,
independent Chartered Surveyors.

The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. An adjustment to
any of these assumptions could lead to a material change in the property valuation.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income
statement in the period in which they arise.

All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market
observable inputs. All classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. IFRS 13
prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors
suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations,
the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the
fair value where applicable. This is on an asset-by-asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may
be a higher and better use. In the current period the highest and best use of all investment properties has been
assessed as their existing use.

The table below presents the income and multiple bandings within which the investment properties have been
valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings. In determining the bandings
to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property but has concluded that
the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this forms the most appropriate disclosure.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy of the Group’s investment properties are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited amount of interrelation
between the variation in these inputs. A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on
the overall valuation of investment properties. Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be
reasonably likely based on the experience of the valuers are illustrated below:

Non-current assets held for sale comprises properties that have been identified by the Group for disposal as part
of the continued disposal programme. The sale of all assets within this category is expected to be completed within
one year of the balance sheet date.

When assets are identified for disposal and meet the criteria within IFRS 5 they are reclassified from property, plant
and equipment to non-current assets held for sale and are revalued at that point to their estimated fair value less
costs to dispose if this is lower than their carrying value. Investment property assets are also moved to non-current
assets held for sale at book value when they meet the criteria within IFRS 5.

Included in non-current assets held for sale are 36 sites (26 September 2021: 42 sites). Of the 42 sites held at 26
September 2021, two sites were among those identified by the CMA as sites which are to be disposed following the
acquisition of Ei Group Limited by the Group. During the period the Group has completed on the remaining two
CMA sites.

**Notes (continued)**

**14** **Impairment testing**

**Property, plant and equipment**

The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for
indicators of impairment, and impairment reversals for previously impaired CGUs. When indicators of impairment
are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is determined as being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses
recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

Value in use calculations use forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax
discount rate of 14.93% (2021: 11.98%). The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured
within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC management have risk adjusted the cost of
debt and the cost of equity by using an average of market risk premiums and Company betas at the period end date
and a CGU specific risk premium has been applied.

Where fair value has been used this is deemed to be a higher value than a value in use calculation amount. External
valuations have been used for this purpose, carried out by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a Avison Young) and Colliers
International Property Advisers UK LLP, independent Chartered Surveyors. The fair value of property assets held in
property, plant and equipment was derived using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) multiplied by an appropriate
rate of return (as defined within RICS Valuation – 2017 Global Edition) or an equivalent multiple. This method of
valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be
generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future
trading potential. An appropriate multiple is then applied to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. In
determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting fair
value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed landlord’s fixtures and fittings. The fair value of
managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent approach involving the net income attributable to the Group
from operating the pub at an appropriate multiple.

All classes of asset, where fair value has been used, are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best
use. IFRS 13 prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or
other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing
their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be
reflected in the fair value where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate
that there may be a higher and better use. In the current period the highest and best use of all the property assets
in property, plant and equipment and investment property has been assessed as their existing use.

Impairments totalling £200 million (2021: £43 million) and impairment reversals of £55 million (2021: £117) were
identified within property, plant and equipment and non-current assets as follows:

**2022** 2021

**Sensitivity analysis – property, plant and equipment**

Where fair value is based on the external valuation, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value
measurement, categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited
amount of interrelation between the variation in these inputs. A change in either of these assumptions could have
a significant effect on valuations and impairment recognised. Sensitivities around these assumptions that are
deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the valuers are illustrated below:

Value in use calculations are most sensitive to discount rate changes and forecast cash flow changes, such that if the
discount rate was to increase by 1%, the impairment charge would increase by £3 million. If the forecast cash flows
were to decrease by 9% the impairment charge would increase by £3 million.

**Notes** _(continued)_

**14** **Impairment testing (continued)**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. The Group considers each of its
operating segments as a cash-generating unit (CGU) for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The carrying
amount of goodwill allocated to each operating segment as described in note 2 at the period end and the movements
during the period is as follows:

**Total net book**

Impairment (44) - - (44)

**25 September 2022** **-** **17** **180** **197**

Within these segments the goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment
to the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The assumptions and inputs for each segment’s goodwill test is set out in the following table. Key assumptions have
been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes
in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable. The key
driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the best publicans, formats
and pub operators, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The discount rate used is based
on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC) which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors
which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC
management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of market risk premiums
and Company betas at the period end date.

Impairment totalling £44 million (2021: £Nil) have been recognised in the Pub Partners segment. This is driven by a
higher than expected discount rate of 13.60% at 25 September 2022 as a result of uncertain market conditions
(2021: 10.74%).

**Sensitivity analysis - goodwill**

The impairment calculation is most sensitive to changes in assumptions used for pre-tax discount rate, growth rate
and forecast EBITDA changes. Management have therefore applied reasonable changes to each assumption and the
results by operating segment are shown below.

Headroom / (impairment)

**25 September** 26 September

**2022** 2021

Change in assumption **£m** £m

**Craft Union**
Growth rate 1% decrease **165** 120

At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt, excluding lease liabilities, totalling £3,121
million (2021: £3,222 million).

In the prior year on 1 December 2020 the Group issued further senior secured notes totalling £120 million and a
further £165 million on 5 August 2021, the terms of which are consistent with the £950 million existing senior
secured notes.

Also in the prior year, on 5 August 2021 a €196 million loan was exchanged for €196 million floating rate notes, the
terms of which are consistent with the €300 million existing floating rate notes. This was assessed as a nonsubstantial modification, such that a gain of £11 million was recognised in exceptional finance costs in the income
statement in the prior period.

The £400 million second lien facility originally charged 8.5% + LIBOR. During the current year as a result of the
interest rate benchmark reform the Group has modified the facility to reference SONIA. The Group has applied the
Phase 2 amendments which provide a practical expedient to update the effective interest rate of the facility.

The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

Trade, other receivables and amounts due from group undertakings – these are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.

Cash and cash equivalents - approximate to the carrying amounts stated in the accounts.

Trade, other payables and amounts due to group undertakings - these are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.

Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

Long term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying
amount in the case of the senior term loan and second lien facility.

Lease liabilities – the fair value of obligations under lease liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows
using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Derivatives – these are carried at fair value.

The Group’s financial instruments consist of securitised loan notes, bank and other borrowings and cash, the main
purpose of which is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group’s other financial instruments, such as
trade receivables and payables, arise directly from its operations.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**22** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source
of inputs used to derive fair value.

The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:

  - Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

  - Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair values of the senior secured notes; privately places notes and euro floating rate notes are measured at
market price and are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Group’s
securitised bonds; second lien facility and bank loans and overdrafts are deemed to be level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy. All other financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a level 2 valuation method.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows:

**25 September** 26 September

**2022** 2021

**£m** £m

**Cross currency interest rate swaps**
Current assets **(2)** 
Non-current liabilities **-** 30

**(2)** 30

The interest rate swaps replace the Euribor currency and floating rate on the Group’s €496 million floating rate loan
notes with a fixed rate. The Group has chosen not to apply hedge accounting for its interest rate swap given the
additional costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IFRS 13. Consequently, movements in fair
value are recognised in the income statement.

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, issued share capital and reserves. These are managed effectively to
minimise the Group’s cost of capital, to add value to shareholders and to service debt obligations. The securitised
debt is monitored by a variety of measures, which are reported to the debt providers on a quarterly basis. The Group
assesses the performance of the business, the level of available funds and the short to medium term strategic plans
concerning capital spend as well as the need to meet financial covenants and such assessment influences the level
of dividends payable.

The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk and credit
risk. The policy for managing each of the Group’s risks is set out as follows.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group seeks
to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs by regular cash flow
forecasting and reporting; monitoring of the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds
and maintenance of undrawn bank facilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s debt
based on contractual, undiscounted cash flows including interest.

**Notes (continued)**

**22** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Interest rate risk**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of trading cash, bank overdraft facilities and fixed and floating
secured loan notes and bonds. The Group’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This
exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates for a large proportion of its debt, being the securitised bonds; the
senior secured notes and the privately placed notes.

At the balance sheet date the Group’s variable rate instruments comprised euro floating rate notes for which the
Group manages the impact of interest rate fluctuations by using cross currency interest rate swaps to manage
exposure and replace the floating rate with a fixed rate of interest, and the second lien facility which charges interest
at SONIA + 8.50%. The Group also faces interest rate risk from its revolving credit facility but due to the nature of
short-term drawings any interest rate risk is considered to be minimal.

The Group therefore predominately faces interest rate risk from the second lien facility. A 1% interest rate increase
would result in an increase to interest charged to the income statement of £4 million (2021: £2 million) and a
corresponding decrease in equity. This is assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was
outstanding for the whole period.

**IBOR Reform**

In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s announcement on 5 March 2021, Sterling LIBOR benchmark
rates have been discontinued after 31 December 2021. During the year the group transitioned its exposures from
Sterling LIBOR based to Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) based for its revolving credit facility and the second
lien facility.

By applying the IFRS 9 Phase 2 amendments for financial instruments measured using amortised cost measurement
changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform have
been reflected by adjusting effective interest rates. No immediate gains or losses have been recognised.

**Security**

The revolving credit facility; senior secured notes; privately placed notes; euro floating notes and second lien facility
borrowings are governed by debentures pursuant to English law incorporating customary fixed and floating charge
security over the assets of the charging companies being Stonegate Pub Company Limited and certain of its
subsidiaries, deemed the Restricted Group, and Cayman Islands law governed equitable share mortgages over the
shares of Stonegate Pub Company Limited and certain other members of the Restricted Group incorporated under
the laws of the Cayman Islands.

Unique Pub Properties Limited is not deemed a Restricted Subsidiary as its assets are secured by way of fixed charge
for the benefit of its bond holders within its securitisation structure. The security pledged for the securitised bonds
is collectively over the whole securitisation incorporating a first fixed charge in favour of the Trustee over the Issuer’s
right, title, interest and benefit, present and future to all properties, cash, eligible investments and income generated
by Unique Pub Properties Limited.

The total value of assets within the Group secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 25 September 2022 is
property, plant and equipment £2,886 million (2021: £3,041 million), investment property £181 million (2021: £138
million) and non-current assets held for sale £16 million (2021: £19 million).

**Notes (continued)**

**22** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Covenants**

The Group is subject to a number of financial covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities. There are three
covenants that relate to the debt as follows:

Two of the covenants relate to the securitised bonds and are tested and reported at each quarter end. The Debt
Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) measures the ability of the securitised group to meet its debt service whilst the Net Worth
covenant in the securitised group must be at least £300 million. The Group has met both covenants during the
financial year.

The one other covenant relates to the RCF. This comprises a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio that is tested quarterly
whilst the RCF is more than 40% drawn. The Group met this covenant during the year.

**Currency risk**
All of the revenues and the majority of the costs of the Group are in sterling. The Group uses cross currency interest
rate swaps to manage exposure to the impact of currency risk from its debt denominated in euros.

**Credit risk**

The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an expected credit loss (ECL)
provision. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure the expected lifetime credit losses
on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic bad debt experience to create an
ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the reporting date. The Group writes off its
trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the debt. The carrying amount of financial
assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

The ageing of trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date, gross of the doubtful debt provision, is as
follows:

**25 September** 26 September

**2022** 2021

**£m** £m

Not past due **42** 43

The Group follows the same basis of categorisation to both free hold property and leasehold property to determine
where to present assets on the balance sheet and therefore right of use assets are recognised in investment
property, non-current assets held for sale and property, plant and equipment depending on the type of sub lease
(where it is sub let) or the commitment to dispose of the property/lease. The following table sets out the movement

million). The practical expedient has been applied to all lease contracts where the rent concessions have met the
conditions per IFRS 16.46.

In relation to those leases under IFRS 16, for the 52 weeks ending 25 September 2022, the Group’s operating profit
metric improved by £16 million (2021: £33 million) as the new depreciation expense is lower than the IAS 17
operating lease charge; however net finance costs are higher than this, at £49 million (2021: £49 million), such that
net profit after tax is lower (2021: lower) compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis. Operating profit before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment and loss on sale of non-current assets is higher (2021: higher) compared to
the previous IAS 17 reporting basis.

**Leases as a lessor**

The Group leases a proportion of its properties to tenants. The majority of lease agreements have terms of between
one and 30 years, most of the leases with terms of over three years include RPI or CPI base rent adjustments and
provisions for rent reviews on either a three year or five year basis. Where the Group is the intermediate lessor the
sublease is classified as a finance lease by reference to the right of use asset, all other leases are classified as
operating leases.

**_Defined contribution pension schemes_**

The Group operates three defined contribution stakeholder schemes for certain employees. The pension cost charge
for the period represents contributions payable by the Group to the schemes and amounted to £6 million (2021: £5
million) At the period end the Group had outstanding contributions payable to the schemes of £1 million (2021:
£Nil).

**_Defined benefit pension schemes_**

On 21 June 2011, as part of the Plato Company 3 acquisition the Group acquired two defined benefit schemes, the
Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension scheme, which are closed to new members and closed to
further accruals for existing members. The assets of the schemes are held in single, separate trustee administered
funds.

A full actuarial valuation for the Laurel Pub Pension scheme was carried out as at 29 February 2020. For the purposes
of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 29 February 2020, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary,
has been updated on an approximate basis to 25 September 2022.

A full actuarial valuation for the Yates Group Pension scheme was carried out as at 29 February 2020. For the
purposes of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 29 February 2020, which was carried out by a qualified independent
actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 25 September 2022.

As the Group has concluded there is no unconditional right to a surplus on wind up, the net deficit on the Laurel Pub
Pension scheme has been recognised at the present value of minimum funding requirements.

At the end of the life of the Yates Group Pension scheme, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund and
any such refund would be paid out only on a net of tax basis.

The Group has agreed with the trustees of the Laurel Pub Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by
the payment of annual contributions of £2 million each year until 2027. The Group will meet the other annual fees
and expenses (excluding the annual PPF levy) incurred by the scheme subject to a cap of £270,000 per scheme year.

The full actuarial valuation of the Yates Group Pension scheme showed a deficit of £3 million. The Group has agreed
with the trustees of the Yates Group Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by the payment of annual
contributions of £500,000 per annum.

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on
standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions
are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows:

**25 September** 26 September

**2022** 2021

**Laurel Pub Pension Scheme**
Male retiring in 2022 21.4 years 21.4 years

The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the period end were as follows:

**25 September** 26 September

**2022** 2021

**Laurel Pub Pension Scheme**
Discount rate **5.2%** 1.9%

Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is set
out below:

Impact on scheme liabilities

**25 September** 26 September

**2022** 2021

Change in assumption **£m** £m

**Laurel Pub Pension Scheme**
Discount rate Increase of 2.5% p.a. (2021: increase of 0.10% p.a.) **(54)** (2)

Rate of inflation Increase of 2.5% p.a. (2021: increase of 0.10% p.a.) **58** 2

Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year **57** 3

**Yates Group Pension Scheme**
Discount rate Increase of 2.5% p.a. (2021: increase of 0.10% p.a.) **(10)** 
Rate of inflation Increase of 2.5% p.a. (2021: increase of 0.10% p.a.) **11** 
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year **11** 

-----

**Notes (continued)**

**27** **Retirement benefits** _(continued)_

The sensitivities shown above are approximate. Each sensitivity considers one change in isolation. The inflation
sensitivity includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation and pension increases. The average
duration of the defined benefit obligation at the period ending 25 September 2022 is 14 years for the Laurel Pub
Pension scheme (2021: 19 years) and 11 years for the Yates Group Pension scheme (2021: 14 years).

The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and
longevity risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result
in an increase to plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to
increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of
the plan’s bond holdings. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the Yates Group Pension
scheme against extreme inflation.

**28** **Related party transactions**

Transactions between group companies, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are
not contained in this note.

_Transactions with senior management personnel_

Senior management comprises the executive directors and management board. The senior management personnel
compensation is as follows:

**£m** £m

Salaries and short-term employee benefits **5** 3

There was no other remuneration paid in either the current or prior period.

_Other related party transactions_

Included in amounts due from parent undertakings is a balance of £1 million owing from Stonegate Pub Company
Pikco Limited, a parent undertaking (2021: £1 million).

There is an amount of £2 million (2021: £2 million) owing to Stonegate Pub Company Midco Limited, the immediate
parent company, at 25 September 2022, which is included in trade and other payables.

During the period the Group was invoiced management charges of £5 million which includes invoices for 2021 when
none were invoiced (2021: £Nil million) by TDR Capital LLP. The amount outstanding at 25 September 2022 was £Nil
(2021: £Nil).

The Group also operated a handful of public houses on behalf of entities affiliated with investment funds managed
by TDR Capital LLP, known as Cubitt House Limited. The balance owing as a result of transactions on its behalf at 25
September 2022 was £163,000 (2021: £105,000).

In a prior period Stonegate Pub Company Limited provided a loan to Stonegate Pub Company Holdings Limited, a
parent undertaking, of £6 million. The loan is repayable on demand and charges annual interest of SONIA + 2.50%.
The amount owed of £7 million is included in trade and other receivables (2021: £6 million).

Included in amounts due from group undertakings is £4 million (2021: £Nil) due in more than one year. On 13 June
2022, Stonegate Pub Company provided a £4 million loan to Stonegate Pub Company Kitchens Limited, a company
under common control of the ultimate parent company, Stonegate Pub Company Topco Sarl, a company
incorporated in Luxembourg. The loan charges interest at a rate of 8.5% and expires in 2029.

**Notes (continued)**

**29** **Management Incentive Plan**

During the period ended 29 September 2019; the Group established a management incentive plan to reward certain
employees, including directors and managers, for their future service. Under the plan those employees will realise a
gain only if there is a growth in the equity value of the business (subject to certain ‘ratchets’) and only if an exit event
occurs. The award has been classified as equity-settled. An exit event would occur either upon an initial public
offering of the Stonegate group (‘IPO’) or some other form of sale (e.g. to a trade buyer).

In the prior period, on 8 January 2021 the scheme was replaced with a new management incentive plan so that it
also included certain legacy EIG employees and new Stonegate employees, alongside a change to the quantum of
returns at an exit event following the acquisition of EI Group. The scheme is operated by the Group’s ultimate owners
and was established through subscription to shares in the Group’s parent company, Stonegate Pub Company
Holdings Limited. A total of 1.8 million shares were issued at an aggregate price of £19.9 million (£10.93 per share).

In the prior period in order to determine the fair value at the date of replacement, Management engaged a third
party to value the MIP immediately before and after the replacement. The value, determined using a Monte Carlo
simulation, was £13.5 million, which was an uplift of £2.1 million for new members and £2.8 million for the change
in return parameters. No dividends will accrue under this award.

There is inherent uncertainty in determining a suitable vesting period given that an exit event, whilst within the
control of the Group’s ultimate owners, may not happen for many years if at all. However, for the purposes of
considering the impact of IFRS 2, the directors have used a vesting period of 5 years. As a result, a charge of £1
million (2021: £1 million) has been recognised as an equity settled share based payment expense in the income
statement.

There are no other share based payment schemes.

**30** **Ultimate parent undertaking**

The ultimate parent company is Stonegate Pub Company Topco Sarl, a company incorporated in Luxembourg. The
ultimate controlling party is TDR Capital Stonegate L.P., an investment fund managed by TDR Capital LLP, a private
equity management firm.

**31** **Post balance sheet events**

There have been no post balance sheet events.

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements**

The directors of Stonegate Pub Company Limited ('the directors') have accepted responsibility for the preparation
of the Strategic report, Director’s report and non-statutory Group accounts for the period ended 26 September 2021
which are intended by them to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss
for that period. They have decided to prepare the non-statutory Group accounts in accordance with UK-adopted
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and applicable Cayman Island company law. In preparing these
non-statutory Group accounts, the directors have:

- selected suitable accounting policies and applied them consistently;

- made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- stated whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, UK-adopted international accounting standards;

- assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

concern; and

- used the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations,

or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
non-statutory Group accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

 Dear Directors


#### Independent auditor’s report to Stonegate Pub Company Limited (“the Company”) 

 Opinion 

 We have audited the non-statutory Group accounts of Stonegate Pub Company Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”) for the 52 week period ended 26 September 2021 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1. These non-statutory Group accounts have been prepared for the reasons set out in note 1. 

 In our opinion the non-statutory Group accounts: 

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 26 September 2021
#### and of the Group’s loss for the period then ended; and

- have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards.

#### Basis for opinion 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and the terms of our engagement letter dated 16 January 2020. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

#### Material uncertainty related to going concern

 We draw attention to note 1.2 to the financial statements which describes the uncertain future effect on trading as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and in particular uncertainty regarding the substantial achievement of base case forecasts and, in downside scenarios the replacement of the scheduled reduction in facilities and the availability of such additional funding as may be needed. These events and conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 1.2, constitute a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group's and company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

 Going concern basis of preparation

 The directors have prepared the non-statutory Group accounts on the going concern basis. As stated above, they have concluded that a material uncertainty related to going concern exists.

 Based on our financial statements audit work, we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the non-statutory Group accounts is appropriate.

 Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – ability to detect

 Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

 To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

- Enquiring of directors, internal audit and members of the Operational Board and
#### inspection of policy documentation as to the wider Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the wider Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.

- Reading Board meeting minutes.

- Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.

#### We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.

 As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates such as impairment of property, plant and equipment. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because within pub revenue the risk arising from site level fraud is limited due to the size of the estate and number of


-----

**_KPMG LLP_**
_Statutory Audit_
_24 January 2022_

#### individual sites, and in relation to rental income each tenant has a signed contractual agreement that billing and collection is based on.

 We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

 In determining the audit procedures, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of some of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.

 We also performed procedures including:

- Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified
#### entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management and those posted to unusual accounts.

- Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are
#### indicative of a potential bias.

 Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations

 We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, and through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. 

 We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit 

 The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

 Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. 

 Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, data protection, anti-bribery, employment law, and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to

**_KPMG LLP_**
_Statutory Audit_
_24 January 2022_

#### enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.

 Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

 Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. 

 In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

 Strategic report and directors’ report 

 The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the non-statutory Group accounts does not cover these reports and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

 Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our non-statutory Group accounts audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the non-statutory Group accounts or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report. 

 Directors’ responsibilities 

 As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 19, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the non-statutory Group accounts, which are intended by them to give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of non-statutory Group accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

 Auditor’s responsibilities 

 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the non-statutory Group accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can

#### arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the non-statutory Group accounts. 

 A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 

 Our report has been prepared for Stonegate Pub Company Limited (“the Company”), and their respective directors (“the Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the Addressees for an opinion from independent auditors on the truth and fairness of the non-statutory Group accounts. It has been released to the Addressees on the basis that our report shall not be copied, referred to or disclosed, in whole (save for the Addressees’ own internal purposes) or in part, without our prior written consent. 

 Our report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time. Our report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us other than the Addressees for any purpose or in any context. Any party other than the Addressees who obtains access to our report or a copy and choose to rely on our report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, KPMG LLP will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of our report to any other party.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1** **Accounting policies**

Stonegate Pub Company Limited (the “Company”) is governed by Cayman Island Company Law and is limited by
shares.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
“Group”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Companies Law (2013
Revision) of the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands do not have prescribed accounting standards, the Group has
elected to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“Adopted IFRSs”), as allowed under Cayman Island Company Law.

There is no statutory requirement for accounts to be audited in the UK; however, these accounts are being prepared
and subject to a non-statutory audit for the purpose of filing accounts of the UK branch of this overseas Group and
formally setting out the financial performance and position of the Group.

No parent company information is presented in these consolidated financial statements, Companies Law (2013
Revision) in the Cayman Islands does not require such information to be presented. The parent company information
has been prepared under FRS 102. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**1.1** **Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are
stated at their fair value: financial liabilities (including derivatives) measured at fair value and investment property.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**1.2** **Going concern**

The Board have reviewed the cash flow forecasts for the Group for the period through to July 2023 (“the going
concern assessment period”). This period incorporates at least 12 months from the date of signing of these financial
statements and incorporates the semi-annual interest due in July 2023 and have concluded that the Group has
sufficient liquidity in order to service its debt and meet its other liabilities as they fall due such that it remains
appropriate to prepare the accounts under the going concern basis.

The financial position of the Group is set out in the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 21 which shows net assets
of £237 million (2020: £437 million). During the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2021 the Group has experienced a
net cash outflow of £70 million (52 weeks ended 27 September 2020: net cash inflow of £286 million) which was a
result of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and also included the issuance of further senior secured notes of
£120 million on the 1 December 2020 and £165 million on the 5 August 2021, generating net proceeds of £283
million.

The Group has continued to meet its day-to-day working capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of
cash generation when sites are open, charging and collecting rents from publicans and its overdraft facility of £25
million and revolving credit facility of £225 million. The continued availability of the revolving credit facility is subject
to compliance with covenants and the facility is scheduled to reduce by £50 million in July 2022 (see note 21). The
Directors consider that this is a normal feature of trading in this industry. In the managed business, customers pay
by cash or card at the point of sale, resulting in minimal credit risk, whilst in the leased and tenanted business, the
Group has a dedicated credit control function, who are able to manage the credit risk exposure. The Group typically
operates with net current liabilities (26 September 2021: £250 million; 27 September 2020: £60 million).

During the period on 1 December 2020 and 5 August 2021 the Group received further senior secured notes totalling
£120 million and £165 million respectively, the terms of which are consistent with the £950 million existing senior
secured notes. At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt totalling £3,222 million (27
September 2020: £2,975 million), of which an amount of £635 million (2020: £673 million) related to the Unique
securitisation is subject to covenants that are tested quarterly and, if breached, would result in the debt becoming
repayable on demand. Details of the debt facilities are set out in note 21.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.2** **Going concern (continued)**

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the liquidity of the Group since the initial closure of the
estate on 20 March 2020 and may continue to do so during the going concern period. The Group has implemented
appropriate measures to reduce the impact on the business, including cost reduction, accessing benefits from the
Government support schemes including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, business rates relief and HMRC
deferment of indirect tax, postponement of refurbishments and other capital expenditure projects.

Following the year end, the Group was trading in line with expectations and had recommenced its full capital
expenditure program. Rising Covid cases during December and the introduction of the Government’s ‘Plan B’
restrictions meant that the Group’s Christmas trading period was negatively impacted, such that it became
appropriate to draw £50 million of the Group’s revolving credit facility.

The base case forecasts are for a period until July 2023 and reflect the anticipated relaxation of the Government’s
‘Plan B’ restrictions from March 2022 when trade is forecast to return to normalised levels throughout the rest of
the going concern assessment period. Normalised levels reflect the Group’s trading post restrictions in the summer
of 2021.

As well as the base case forecasts indicating that there is sufficient liquidity in the Group, the forecasts also indicate
that there are no breaches to covenants within either the Group’s revolving credit facility nor the Unique
securitisation.

Given the success of the vaccine roll-out and ‘Plan B’ restrictions the Board do not believe further national lockdowns
are likely at the date of signing these financial statements, though further restrictions on trading may occur.
However, the Board has considered a severe but plausible downside scenario that includes the effect of further
restrictions on trading in the going concern assessment period. These forecasts also reflect controllable mitigating
actions within its control, principally scaling down the expected capital expenditure program for FY23.

The severe but plausible forecasts indicate that the Group will require the replacement of the scheduled £50 million
reduction of the RCF facility in July 2022 and further additional funding in order to continue to meet its liabilities as
they fall due. The directors are confident that the maturing facility can be replaced or alternative debt funding
raised.

The severe but plausible forecasts also indicate a breach in the RCF covenant at the April 2023 test date resulting in
the facility becoming repayable on demand. The Group currently has no plans to negotiate any further waivers with
the RCF lenders, but if it needed to, they have been supportive already and the Directors are confident they would
be supportive again if required. In the absence of such waivers, the Group would require addition funding even if
mitigating actions within its control were implemented.

Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going
concern basis. However, the future uncertain effect on trading arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and in
particular the substantial achievement of base case forecasts and, in downside scenarios, the replacement of the
scheduled reduction in facilities and the availability of such additional funding as may be needed, indicate that a
material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for
the going concern assessment period, and therefore that the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not contain the adjustments that would
result if the Group were unable to continue as a going concern.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.3** **Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings made up to 26 September 2021. The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this
method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated
profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s
equity in those subsidiaries. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests.

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated.

**1.4** **Financial instruments**

_Recognition and initial measurement_

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial
assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is
initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), transaction costs
that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component
is initially measured at the transaction price.

**_Classification and subsequent measurement_**

**_Financial assets_**

_(a)_ _Classification_

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other
comprehensive income (‘’FVOCI’’) – debt investment; FVOCI – equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not
reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period
following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and
selling financial assets; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present
subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment
basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.
This includes all derivative financial assets.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.4** **Financial instruments (continued)**

_(b)_ _Subsequent measurement and gains and losses_

_Financial assets at FVTPL - these assets (other than derivatives designated as hedging instruments) are subsequently_
measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or
loss.

_Financial assets at amortised cost - These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective_
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and
losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or
loss.

_Debt investments at FVOCI - these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using_
the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are
reclassified to profit or loss.

_Equity investments at FVOCI - these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as_
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other
net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.

**_Financial liabilities and equity_**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two
conditions:

(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments
or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial
assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Group’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial
statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL
if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial
liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised
in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.4** **Financial instruments (continued)**

When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing
financial liability. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability
or as a substantial modification, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the
extinguishment and written off through non-underlying finance costs and the new borrowings are recognised at fair
value. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a non-substantial modification, a gain or loss is recognised
at the time of the non-substantial modification (to the extent that there is a change in the expected amount or
timing of payments of interest and principal). The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the present
value of the cash flows (excluding fees) under the original and modified terms discounted at the original effective
interest rate. Any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the
remaining life of the modified loan.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**1.5** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

  - right-of-use assets are depreciated over their lease lives;

  - freehold properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values over 50 years;

  - leasehold properties and improvements are depreciated over the shortest of 50 years, their estimated
useful lives and their remaining lease periods;

  - long-life landlords’ fixtures and fittings are depreciated over 5 to 30 years;

  - retail, administration and short-life landlords’ furniture, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated
over 3 to 15 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

The Group capitalises employment costs and related personal expenses of individuals whose job roles are
fundamentally associated with managing or implementing the Group’s capital development programme. Judgement
is therefore applied in determining the element of internal labour costs which are directly attributable to capital
projects. Where such an individual undertakes non-capital expenditure related activities as part of their job roles
then a proportion of their cost is not capitalised unless the non-capital expenditure related activities are incidental
to their role.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.6** **Investment property**

The Group leases some properties on commercial leases within the Commercial Properties segment. The commercial
terms of these leases result in the assets meeting the criteria of investment property.

Properties held as investment property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet
date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external
valuers.

Transfers are made to/from investment property when there is change of use evidenced by a change in the lease
terms. When a property transfers from property, plant and equipment to investment property, and vice versa, it is
revalued to fair value and the movement recognised in the income statement.

**1.7** **Non-current assets held for sale**

Properties identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are
held at the lower of carrying value on transfer to non-current assets held for sale, as assessed at the time of transfer,
and fair value less costs to dispose. The fair value less costs to dispose is based on the net estimated realisable
disposal proceeds (ERV) which is derived from internal valuations when the property is transferred to non-current
assets held for sale and then sense checked with third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the
properties.

Licensed land and buildings, investment property and right-of-use assets are classified as held for sale when they
have been identified for disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition
and the sale should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the
property or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Licensed land and buildings
held for sale are not depreciated and right of use assets held for sale are not amortised.

Profits or losses on disposal of property are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal.

**1.8** **Business combinations**

Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition
method. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.

_Acquisitions post transition date_

For acquisitions on or after 26 September 2011, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

  - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

  - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, if any; plus

  - the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

  - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed
as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise,
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.9** **Intangible assets and goodwill**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is stated at cost less
any impairment. At 26 September 2021 the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments described in note
2. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the
Group’s operating segments. As properties move between segments the associated goodwill will also be transferred.

_Brand_

Brand intangible assets recognised on acquisition are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 10 years.

**1.10** **Leases**

_As a lessee_

The Group leases properties and vehicles.

At the inception of a contract the Group assesses whether that contract is or contains a lease. This is the case if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
The Group has taken the practical expedient in paragraph C3 of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ not to reassess whether an existing
contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application and as such the IFRS 16 definition of a lease has only
been applied to contracts which were entered into or amended on or after 29 September 2019.

The Group has elected not to apply the lessee requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases and leases for which the
underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments for such leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

For all other leases where it is the lessee the Group recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use asset at the
commencement date of the lease.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments at commencement date,
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The carrying amount of the lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and
decreased by lease payments made.

The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index
rate or, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as
appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be
exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

For rent concessions in leases the Group assesses whether there is a lease modification. The lease liability is then remeasured at the present value of the revised lease payments at the modification date, discounted using the interest
rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The
change in the present value of the lease liability is accounted for as an increase to the right-of-use asset where it
relates to a future change, with any element relating to a past payment dated before the modification date
accounted for in the income statement.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.10** **Leases (continued)**

The right-of-use asset is recognised at an amount equal to the total of the lease liability, any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs and the estimated future dismantling, removal and site
restoration costs. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in
‘property, plant and equipment’, the same line item as it presents underlying assets of the same nature that it owns.

Right-of-use assets included in property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost, and subsequently at
cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurements or
modifications of the lease liability. Where the right-of-use asset is in relation to an investment property it is initially
measured at cost, and subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Where a property held on lease transfers from PPE to investment property the right of use asset is revalued to fair
value before transfer.

_As a lessor_

Lessor accounting remains similar to IAS 17, whereby the lessor continues to classify leases as finance or operating
leases, however, the standard prescribes that the sub-lease of an asset held on a lease is categorised as a finance
lease or an operating lease with reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease;
if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether
the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease,
not with reference to the underlying asset.

Where a property that is leased is re-leased to a third party and that sub-lease is categorised as a finance lease the
right of use asset is derecognised and it is replaced by a financial asset being the net investment in that sublease.
The net investment in the sub-lease is calculated as the net present value of the future rent payments receivable at
the interest rate implicit in the sub-lease or, if that cannot be readily determined, at the discount rate used for the
head lease.

The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The
Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in
the lease.

The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the
lease term as part of revenue.

_Lease acquired in a business combination_

For leases acquired in a business combination, the Group measures the acquired lease liability at the present value
of the remaining lease payments, as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. The right-of-use
asset is measured at acquisition at the same amount as the lease liability, adjusted to reflect favourable or
unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
less any costs of disposal. Cost is calculated using the first in first out method.

**1.12** **Trade receivables and trade payables**

Trade receivables are held at their original invoiced amount net of an Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) allowance based
on the simplified model as allowed by IFRS 9. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure
the expected lifetime credit losses on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic
bad debt experience to create an ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the
reporting date. The Group writes off its trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the
debt.

Trade payables are held at amortised cost.

**1.13** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents
for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.

**1.14** **Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

_Financial assets (including receivables)_

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates
that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect
on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between
its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original
effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the
discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment
loss is reversed through profit or loss.

_Non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment or impairment
reversals. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible
assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated
each year at the same time.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped
together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.14** **Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets (continued)**

The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each CGU is reviewed for impairment if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or for impairment
reversals. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. Where fair value is used
this is based on known sales proceeds or an external valuation. Any changes in outlet earnings or cash flows, the
discount rate applied to those cash flows and fair value could give rise to an additional impairment loss.

The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill
to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is
monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments. The recoverable amount of the
CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require
estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying
amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised
in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had
been recognised. The reversal is recognised in the income statement.

**1.15** **Employee benefits**

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net
obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit
is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The
Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit
liability/asset.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity
dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the
benefits are expected to be paid. Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest).
The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined
benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.15** **Employee benefits (continued)**

When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to
past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the
plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified
actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised
asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.

The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The
gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being
settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and
any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or
profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past
service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

_Share-based payment transactions_

Where the Group or Company’s parent grants rights to its equity instruments to this Group or Company’s employees,
which are accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated accounts of the parent, the Group or Company as the
case may be account for these share-based payments as equity-settled. As the shares to be given to the employees
are not the Group or Company’s own equity instruments and have been effectively paid for by the parent entity, the
Group or Company recognises a share-based payment expense in its income statement and an associated capital
contribution in equity from its parent.

The fair value of share-based payments awards at the date of grant is recognised as an employee expense, with a
corresponding increase in equity as stated above, over the period that the employees become unconditionally
entitles to the awards. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into
accounts the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.16** **Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

A provision for onerous leases is made for non-trading sites closure costs.

**1.17** **Revenue**

Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal
course of business, net of discounts and VAT. Revenue from drink and food is recognised at the point at which the
goods are provided. Property rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.

**Leased and tenanted**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from the supply of drink products to publicans and revenue is recognised_
at the point of delivery to the pub at which point physical possession is passed and the publican takes control of the
product, obtaining the significant risks and rewards of ownership. The proceeds from the sale are recognised as
revenue.

_Rent revenue – Rent revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease based on the contractual_
terms of the lease agreement.

_Revenue from amusement and other machines – Amusement machine royalty income represents the Group’s share_
of the net income earned from machines in the Group’s properties. The revenue is recognised in the period to which
the sale relates.

**Managed**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from retail sale of drinks to customers and is recognised at the point of_
delivery.

_Food revenue –_ Food revenue is earned from retail sale of food to customers and is recognised at the point of
delivery.

_Revenue from amusement and other machines – Amusement machine income represents the income earned from_
machines in our managed properties. The revenue is recognised in the period to which the sale relates.

_Admission, accommodation and other revenue – Other revenue includes admission and accommodation income and_
is recognised at the point of delivery.

**Operator-led**

_Drink revenue – Drink revenue is earned from retail sale of drinks to customers and is recognised at the point of_
delivery.

_Food revenue –_ Food revenue is earned from retail sale of food to customers and is recognised at the point of
delivery.

_Revenue from amusement and other machines – Amusement machine income represents the income earned from_
machines in our managed properties. The revenue is recognised in the period to which the sale relates.

_Admission and other revenue – Other revenue includes admission and accommodation income and is recognised at_
the point of delivery.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.18** **Government Grants**

Money received in the form of a government grant is treated as revenue. Therefore, grant income is recorded within
other income in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods as the related expenses are
incurred.

**1.19** **Supplier incentives**

Supplier incentives and rebates are recognised within operating costs as they are earned. The accrued value at the
reporting date is included in trade and other receivables.

**1.20** **Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
periods.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided
for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**1.21** **Exceptional items**

The Group presents separately on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense
which are outside of the normal course of trading, which management consider will distort comparability, in order
to provide a trend measure of underlying performance. This includes movements in the valuation of investment
properties and the impairment of property, plant and equipment which do not directly result from the underlying
trading performance of the Group and are not in their direct control, and therefore have been categorised as
exceptional items. These costs are discussed further in note 7.

**Notes (continued)**

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**1.22** **Key accounting judgements and estimates**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses during the period.

Management periodically evaluates its estimates and judgements and bases them on historical experience and other
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

**Key accounting judgements**

The following are the key judgements, apart from those involving estimations, dealt with separately below, that
management have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and which have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

_Exceptional items_

During the period certain items are identified and separately disclosed as exceptional. Judgement is applied as to
whether the item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed. This assessment covers the
nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that item on reported performance. Note 7
provides information on all of the items disclosed as exceptional in the current and previous period.

_Going concern_

The directors exercise judgement when concluding on going concern as the basis of preparation of the financial
statements. For further details see note 1.2.

_Covid-19 financial support_

Management have exercised judgement when determining that financial support granted to the Group’s publicans
during the period constituted variable payments under its leases. This judgement is driven by the Group’s
commitment to support its publicans during periods of detrimental changes to their business outside their control
being part of their agreement with us for the lease of the pub. Management have determined that the Covid-19
pandemic is such a detrimental change and that the financial support concessions granted to them fall under the
original terms of the lease rather than a modification to the lease. The effect of this judgement being that £41 million
of financial support has been recognised in the current financial period being the period in which the trigger event
for the variable payments arose. Had the directors instead concluded that the concessions represented a
modification of the existing leases, an amount of up to £41 million (2020: £19 million) would have been spread
straight line over the remaining lease terms, reducing rental income in future periods.

_Insurance claim_

Following the closure of pubs as a result of Covid, the Group reviewed the business interruption wording in its
insurance policies and has sought legal advice on whether we are able to challenge the insurers view that no amounts
are payable under the policy. The challenge was submitted in the financial year and the insurer paid out £2.5 million
in December 2020, justified as their settlement of the claim. The Group received a further on account payment of
£12 million in May 2021 towards Additional Increase in Cost of Working (AICW) losses, for which we need to provide
substantive evidence. Both amounts have been taken to exceptional other income in the period.

**1.22** **Key accounting judgements and estimates (continued)**

**Key areas of estimation**

The following are the key areas of estimation uncertainty that may have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements.

_Impairment of property, plant, equipment_

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and fair
values. Where fair values have been used these are derived from known sales proceeds or an external valuation.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are also assessed for any indications that the loss has decreased or no
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. Impairment is discussed further in note 13.

_Valuation of investment properties_

Properties held as investment property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet
date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Fair values are determined based on an annual revaluation by external
valuers.

Investment properties are valued annually to fair value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual
published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and IFRS 13. The valuation is based on an assessment
of the income generating potential of the properties and applying an appropriate multiple. The highest and best use
for the property assets is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally due to the legal restrictions
imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial implications of a change of use
given those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However, consideration is given to an alternative highest
and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists which is physically possible, legally
permissible and financially feasible to access. Further information about the valuation of investment properties is
provided in note 10 of these financial statements.

The valuation methodology uses an estimation of the fair maintainable trade (FMT) of a property and then applies
a multiple. The FMT is estimated based on historic trends and projected future income whilst the multiples are
determined by our valuers with reference to each specific asset and market information. For more detail on the FMT
and multiples see note 10.

**1.23** **Adopted IFRS not yet applied**

The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:

  - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (effective
date 1 January 2021).

  - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective date to be confirmed).

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent (effective date to be confirmed).

  - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective date to be confirmed).

  - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3 (effective date to be confirmed).

  - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use (effective date to
be confirmed).

  - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective date to be confirmed).

**Notes (continued)**

**2** **Segmental reporting**

The directors determine the appropriate operating segments based on the discrete management information
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).

Following the acquisition of Ei Group Limited in the prior period, the Group had five distinguishable revenue
generating operating segments being Pub Partners, Commercial Property, Stonegate, Craft Union and Managed
Investments which reflected the different nature of income earned, types of property and profile of customers. Since
operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments when they have similar economic characteristics,
Stonegate, Craft Union and Managed Investments were combined as they represented income earned from the
direct operation of pubs, albeit through different trading styles.

As understanding of the estate has developed with sites now open and trading, management information has
evolved such that it has become clear that there are six distinguishable revenue generating operating segments
being Pub Partners, Commercial Properties, Stonegate, Craft Union, Managed Investments and Vixen, and the CODM
reviews discrete information on these segments. These have been aggregated into three reportable segments as
outlined below:

1) Leased and tenanted comprising Pub Partners and Commercial Properties – The Group receives rental income
from leasing these sites to third parties. Revenue is also received from tied sites within Pub Partners for the supply
of drinks and gaming machines. The Group has no direct involvement in the operation of each site.

2) Managed comprising Stonegate and Managed Investments – The Group generates revenue from the sale of food,
drink, admission, accommodation and gaming machine income. Each site is fully managed by the Group, such that
the Group is exposed to all operational risks and in return receives the full retail margin.

3) Operator-led comprising Craft Union and Vixen – The Group receives revenue from the sale of food, drink,
admission and gaming machine income. The Group contracts with an operating company to manage the day-to-day
operations of the site for which they receive a turnover-based fee. All labour costs are borne by the operating
company, with all other costs being borne by the Group. The Group has access to the full retail margin.

Central costs represent certain head office expenses which are not attributable to specific segments. Accordingly,
these costs are disclosed as a separate column within the segmental notes.

The CODM reviews the financial results by segment to EBITDA, which represents operating profit / (loss) before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment, revaluation, and profit / (loss) on sale of non-current assets, and this
therefore provides the basis for the disclosures below. Inter-segment revenues and costs are eliminated upon
consolidation such that all numbers disclosed in the table below are with external customers.

All of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is not further segmented based on location,
therefore no geographical segmental analysis has been provided. The balance sheet is not reviewed by the CODM
on a segmented basis and therefore no disclosure has been made in relation to segmental assets and liabilities.

**Acquisition and integration costs: Acquisition and integration costs include items of one-off expenditure associated**
with business combinations together with the various integration and restructuring costs to successfully bring the
acquisitions into the Group. In the current period, £1 million of costs were incurred on integration following the
acquisition of Ei Group Limited in March 2020. In the prior financial period, the Group incurred £30 million of
professional fees associated with the acquisition of Ei Group Limited, £6 million of stamp duties and £10 million of
integration costs. It also incurred £2 million of integration costs following acquisitions made in previous periods.

**Business interruption insurance: Following the closure of pubs as a result of Covid-19 the Group has received £14**
million in relation to an insurance claim relating to business interruption during this period of closure (2020: £Nil).
This is discussed further in note 1.22.

**Surrender premiums: During the period £1 million (52 weeks ended 27 September 2020: £1 million) of assignment**
premiums were paid to publicans in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other
than at renewal. Following the acquisition of Ei Group Limited, the Group are looking to review the entire portfolio
of assets and move pubs across segments into their perceived optimum operating format. This one-off process is
likely to take five years, during which time any assignment premiums paid will be shown as exceptional.

**Other costs: Other costs of £4 million in the period (52 weeks ended 27 September 2020: £nil) consist of £1 million**
of professional fees associated with covid-related landlord renegotiations and a £3 million increase in health and
safety provisions.

Properties held as investment property are measured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet
date. Investment properties include free-of-tie pubs let to tenants at open market rents and non-pub assets, which
are predominantly blue-chip let convenience stores. These assets have been valued adopting the investment
method of valuation. By reference to the rents, fixed lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple
based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value.
Valuations are carried out on an annual basis at each period end date. The Group’s properties were valued as at 26
September 2021 by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a Avison Young) and Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP,
independent Chartered Surveyors.

The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. An adjustment to
any of these assumptions could lead to a material change in the property valuation.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income
statement in the period in which they arise.

All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market
observable inputs. All classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. IFRS 13
prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors
suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations,
the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the
fair value where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may
be a higher and better use. In the current period the highest and best use of all investment properties has been
assessed as their existing use.

The table below presents the income and multiple bandings within which the investment properties have been
valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings. In determining the bandings
to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property but has concluded that
the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this forms the most appropriate disclosure.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy of the Group’s investment properties are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited amount of interrelation
between the variation in these inputs. A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on
the overall valuation of investment properties. Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be

Non-current assets held for sale comprises properties that have been identified by the Group for disposal as part
of the continued disposal programme. The sale of all assets within this category is expected to be completed within
one year of the balance sheet date.

When assets are identified for disposal and meet the criteria within IFRS 5 they are reclassified from property, plant
and equipment to non-current assets held for sale and are revalued at that point to their fair value less costs to
dispose if this is lower than their carrying value. Investment property assets are also moved to non-current assets
held for sale at book value when they meet the criteria within IFRS 5.

Included in non-current assets held for sale are 42 sites (27 September 2020: 105 sites) in total with 2 sites (27
September 2020: 42 sites) identified by the CMA as sites which are to be disposed following the acquisition of Ei
Group Limited by the Group. Subsequent to the period end the Group has completed on the remaining 2 CMA sites.

During the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2020 goodwill of £102 million was recognised relating to the acquisition
of Ei Group Limited (see note 14).

Goodwill has been reduced in the period by £1 million (2020: £1 million), representing the apportioned value of
goodwill allocated to those sites disposed of during the period.

As part of the transition to IFRS 16 right-of-use assets with a net book value of £150 million have been reclassified
to property, plant and equipment in the prior period (see note 9).

**Notes (continued)**

**13** **Impairment testing**

**Property, plant and equipment**

The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for
indicators of impairment, and impairment reversals for previously impaired CGUs. When indicators of impairment
are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is determined as being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses
recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. The conditions for this reversal are discussed further on the following page.

Value in use calculations use forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax
discount rate of 11.98% (2020: 9.58%). Management has applied a CGU specific risk premium to the discount rate
used for goodwill impairment testing. The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within
the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and
the cost of equity by using an average of market risk premiums and Company betas at the period end date.

Where fair value has been used this is deemed to be a higher value than a value in use calculation amount. External
valuations have been used for this purpose, carried out by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a Avison Young) and Colliers
International Property Advisers UK LLP, independent Chartered Surveyors. The fair value of property assets held in
property, plant and equipment was derived using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) multiplied by an appropriate
rate of return (as defined within RICS Valuation – 2017 Global Edition) or an equivalent multiple. This method of
valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be
generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future
trading potential. An appropriate multiple is then applied to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. In
determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting fair
value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed landlord’s fixtures and fittings. The fair value of
managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent approach involving the net income attributable to the Group
from operating the pub at an appropriate multiple.

All classes of asset, where fair value has been used, are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best
use. IFRS 13 prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or
other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing
their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be
reflected in the fair value where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate
that there may be a higher and better use. In the current period the highest and best use of all the property assets
in property, plant and equipment and investment property has been assessed as their existing use.

Impairments totalling £43 million (2020: £367 million) and impairment reversals of £117 million (2020: £Nil) were
identified within property, plant and equipment and non-current assets as follows:

**Notes** _(continued)_

**13** **Impairment testing (continued)**

In the prior period the Group incurred a £367 million impairment charge which was predominantly driven by the
uncertainty of future cash flows on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic. As at the current period end, 26 September
2021, the Group has assessed changes in estimates used to determine impairment charges in the prior period.
External valuations supporting those sites assessed on a fair value basis in the prior period included an income
shortfall deduction or reduction in property multiples to reduce the site valuations as a result of the impact of Covid19. This methodology is no longer considered necessary and therefore has been removed.

For sites assessed on a value in use basis, the Group has seen improvements in trading performance which were not
expected at the prior period end. A combination of these factors has led to £117 million of the previous period’s
impairments being reversed (FY20: Nil). However, a further £43 million impairment charge has been incurred as the
underlying trading levels in a number of sites has worsened since previous period end.

**Sensitivity analysis – property, plant and equipment**

Where fair value is based on the external valuation, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value
measurement, categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited
amount of interrelation between the variation in these inputs. A change in either of these assumptions could have
a significant effect on valuations and impairment recognised. Sensitivities around these assumptions that are
deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the valuers are illustrated below:

**68** 68


-2.5% **(68)** (68)

**Multiple sensitivity**
+0.25 **76** 75

-0.25 **(76)** (75)

Value in use calculations are most sensitive to discount rate changes and forecast cash flow changes, such that if the
discount rate was to increase by 1%, the impairment charge would increase by £1 million. If the forecast cash flows
were to decrease by 5% the impairment charge would increase by £1 million.

**Notes** _(continued)_

**13** **Impairment testing (continued)**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill
allocated to each operating segment as described in note 2 at the period end and the movements during the period
is as follows:

Transfers between segments (1) 2 (1) 
Disposals - - (1) (1)

**26 September 2021** **46** **17** **179** **242**

Within these segments the goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment
to the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The assumptions and inputs for each segment’s goodwill test is set out in the following table. Key assumptions have
been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes
in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable. The key
driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the best publicans, formats
and pub operators, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The discount rate used is based
on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC) which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors
which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC
management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of market risk premiums
and Company betas at the period end date.

_Acquisitions in the prior period_

Ei Group Limited

On 3 March 2020, Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited acquired the entire share capital of Ei Group Limited.
Total consideration was £1,265 million satisfied in cash. The acquisition was funded by external debt and the issue
of shares.

A summary of the fair values of the assets and liabilities are given in the table below:

**Goodwill (note 10)** **102**

Goodwill is considered to represent the benefits and synergies that will be gained from combining these sites with
the Group’s existing portfolio of brands and sites.

The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £36 million related to stamp duty and external legal professional
fees. These costs have been included in ‘exceptional operating costs’ in the consolidated income statement (see
note 7).

**Property, plant and equipment: Included in property, plant and equipment are freehold and leasehold properties**
of £2,984 million whose fair value was derived at by an external valuation carried out by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a
Avison Young) and Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP, independent Chartered Surveyors. Property
assets held in property, plant and equipment were valued using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) capitalised
at an appropriate rate of return (as defined within RICS Valuation - 2017 Global Edition) or an equivalent multiple.
This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine
income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking
into account future trading potential. This assessment of profit is then capitalised at an appropriate multiple to
reflect the risks and rewards of the property being valued. In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider
evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings
and any fixed landlord's fixtures and fittings. Also included in property, plant and equipment are right-of-use assets
of £309 million. Management has re-calculated the lease liability based on the future payments and the incremental
borrowing rate at the date of the acquisition and measured the ROU asset equal to the lease liability at the
acquisition date.

**Notes (continued)**

**14** **Acquisitions (continued)**

**Investment property: Included in investment property are freehold and leasehold properties of £127 million whose**
fair value was derived at by an external valuation carried out by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a Avison Young) and Colliers
International Property Advisers UK LLP, independent Chartered Surveyors. These assets have been valued adopting
the investment method of valuation. By reference to the rents, fixed lease terms and market conditions, an
appropriate multiple based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back
to present value.

**Intangible assets: The fair values of intangible assets were considered but there were none identified of a material**
value.

**Inventory: The fair value of inventory was deemed to be its carrying value at the date of acquisition.**

**Trade and other receivables: Trade receivables are primarily rent and drink debt owing from publicans. Ei Group**
has a stable customer base mostly paying within their payment terms. Historically, Ei Group has not had any
significant write offs. As at 3 March 2020, Ei Group has calculated a expected credit loss provision in accordance
with IFRS 9, which is included in this balance.

**Non-current assets held for sale: Non-current assets classified as held for sale at the acquisition date must be**
measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with IFRS 3. Management have calculated a fair value uplift
of £1 million which is the difference between the estimated recovery value (ERV) and carrying value of the asset
held for sale. Where there is risk in relation to planning consent being obtained, that risk has been reflected in the
ERV in accordance with IFRS 13 which requires an entity to take into account, the characteristics of the asset or
liability being measured that a market participant would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date.

**Borrowings: Included in borrowings were debentures with a fair value of £1,024 million, unsecured facilities with a**
fair value of £160 million and a revolving credit facility of £30 million all of which was repaid shortly after acquisition.
Also included were securitised bonds with a fair value of £778 million which are amortising and have maturities
falling due between 2024 and 2032. The securitised bonds were not repaid as part of the acquisition, therefore, in
accordance with IFRS 3, they should be included on the balance sheet at fair value. As the securitised bonds are
traded in an active market, a fair value of £778 million was calculated based on the 2 March closing bond prices
multiplied by the quantity of each bond held at the acquisition date, resulting in a fair value adjustment required of
£93 million.

**Deferred tax: The deferred tax balance consists of the difference between the fair value and tax base on accelerated**
capital allowances; the surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets; the fair value of the debt acquired and IFRS 16
adjustments.

_Other acquisitions in the prior period:_
During the prior period the Group completed the assignment of one leasehold site. Right-of-use assets of £2 million
were recognised relating to this acquisition.

Total payments for business acquisitions in the prior period were £1,265 million.

unrecognised deferred tax asset of £Nil million (2020: £1 million) relating to unutilised losses in Intertain Limited.

In the 3 March 2021 Budget, it was announced that the UK tax rate will increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. This has
a consequential effect on the Group’s future tax charge. This rate change had been substantively enacted at the
current balance sheet date and as a result the net deferred tax position has increased by £19 million.

At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt, excluding lease liabilities, totalling £3,222
million (2020: £2,975 million).

On 3 March 2020 the Group issued debt of £2,300 million consisted of £1,450 million bridging loans; a £450 million
senior term loan and a £400 million second lien facility. The proceeds from the issue of the loans on 3 March 2020
were used to finance the acquisition of Ei Group Limited, repay existing secured fixed and floating notes (£405 million
and £340 million respectively) and pay fees in connection with the transactions.

As part of the acquisition of Ei Group Limited on 3 March 2020, the Group acquired securitised bonds of £678 million.
These securitised bonds consist of Class A4 notes charging an annual interest rate of 5.66%, Class M notes charging
an annual interest rate of 7.40% and Class N notes charging an annual interest rate of 6.46%.

The securitised bonds were not repaid as part of the acquisition, therefore, in accordance with IFRS 3, they have
been included on the balance sheet at fair value. As the securitised bonds are traded in an active market, a fair value
of £778 million was calculated based on the 2 March closing bond prices multiplied by the quantity of each bond
held at the acquisition date, resulting in a fair value adjustment required of £93 million. The notes will mature
between 2024 and 2032.

In July 2020 the Group refinanced the bridging loans into £500 million privately placed fixed rate notes charging
annual interest rate of 8%. The notes will mature on 13 July 2025 and are listed on the Channel Islands stock
exchange. The Group also refinanced the remaining £950 million of the bridging loans into senior secured fixed rate
notes charging an annual interest rate of 8.25%. The notes will mature on 31 July 2025 and are listed on the Channel
Islands stock exchange. The changes to the bridging debt were considered in line with the requirements of IFRS 9
and management concluded the changes are to be accounted as a non-substantial modification to the existing debt.


-----

**Notes (continued)**

**21** **Borrowings (continued)**

As a result, the amortised cost of the liability was recalculated and a loss of £89 million recognised in exceptional
finance costs in the income statement in the prior period.

On 31 July 2020 €300 million of the senior term loan was re-financed for floating rate notes charging an annual
interest rate of 3 months Euribor +5.75%. The notes will mature on 31 July 2025 and are listed on the Channel Islands
stock exchange. Management have concluded the modification of the debt from sterling to euros to be a substantial
modification. A loss on extinguishment of £16 million has been recognised in exceptional finance costs in the income
statement in the prior period.

Furthermore, on 25 September 2020 the remaining senior term loan was converted into a €196 million loan.
Management have assessed the redenomination of the debt into euros to be a substantial modification. A gain on
extinguishment of £2 million was recognised in exceptional finance costs in the income statement in the prior period.

During the current period on 1 December 2020 the Group issued further senior secured notes totalling £120 million
and a further £165 million on 5 August 2021, the terms of which are consistent with the £950 million existing senior
secured notes.

On 5 August 2021 the €196 million senior term loan was exchanged for €196 million floating rate notes, the terms
of which are consistent with the €300 million existing floating rate notes. This has been assessed as a non-substantial
modification, such that a gain of £11 million has been recognised in exceptional finance costs in the income
statement in the current period.

**Notes (continued)**

**22** **Financial instruments (continued)**

The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

Trade, other receivables and amounts due from group undertakings – these are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.

Cash and cash equivalents - approximate to the carrying amounts stated in the accounts.

Trade, other payables and amounts due to group undertakings - these are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.

Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

Long term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying
amount in the case of the senior term loan and second lien facility.

Lease liabilities – the fair value of obligations under lease liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows
using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

The Group’s financial instruments consist of securitised loan notes, bank and other borrowings and cash, the main
purpose of which is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group’s other financial instruments, such as
trade receivables and payables, arise directly from its operations.

**Fair value hierarchy**

IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source
of inputs used to derive fair value.

The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:

  - Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

  - Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

  - Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair values of the securitised bonds; senior secured notes; privately places notes and euro floating rate notes are
measured at market price and are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the
Group’s second lien facility and bank loans and overdrafts are deemed to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. All
other financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a level 2 valuation method.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows:

**26 September 27 September**

**2021** 2020

**£m** £m

**Cross currency interest rate swaps**
Non-current liabilities **30** 3

**30** 3

The interest rate swaps replace the Euribor rate on the Group’s €496 million floating rate loan notes with a fixed
rate. The Group has chosen not to apply hedge accounting for its interest rate swap given the additional costs of
meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IFRS 13. Consequently, movements in fair value are
recognised in the income statement.

**Notes (continued)**

**22** **Financial instruments (continued)**

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, issued share capital and reserves. These are managed effectively to
minimise the Group’s cost of capital, to add value to shareholders and to service debt obligations. The securitised
debt is monitored by a variety of measures, which are reported to the debt providers on a quarterly basis. The Group
assesses the performance of the business, the level of available funds and the short to medium term strategic plans
concerning capital spend as well as the need to meet financial covenants and such assessment influences the level
of dividends payable.

The main risks from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk and credit
risk. The policy for managing each of the Group’s risks is set out as follows.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group seeks
to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs by regular cash flow

**Interest rate risk**
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of trading cash, bank overdraft facilities and fixed and floating
secured loan notes and bonds. The Group’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This
exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates for a large proportion of its debt, being the securitised bonds; the
senior secured notes and the privately placed notes. The Group seeks to minimise the impact of interest rate
fluctuations from its euro floating rate loan notes and uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure.

**Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks**

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of
some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as 'IBOR reform'). The Group
has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide
initiatives. There is uncertainty over the timing and the methods of transition in some jurisdictions that the Group
operates in. The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its risk management.

The Group has modified all of its floating-rate liabilities indexed to sterling LIBOR to reference SONIA. The Group’s
IBOR exposures to non-derivative financial liabilities as at 26 September 2021 were the second lien facility indexed
to GBP LIBOR and floating rate notes indexed to Euribor. The calculation methodology of Euribor changed during
2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to
Euribor under the _European Union Benchmarks Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use_
Euribor for both existing and new contracts and the Group expects that Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark
rate for the foreseeable future.

The Group monitors the progress of transition from IBORs to new benchmark rates by reviewing the total amounts
of contracts that have yet to transition to an alternative benchmark rate and the amounts of such contracts that
include an appropriate fallback clause. The Group considers that a contract is not yet transitioned to an alternative
benchmark rate when interest under the contract is indexed to a benchmark rate that is still subject to IBOR reform,
even if it includes a fallback clause that deals with the cessation of the existing IBOR (referred to as an ‘unreformed
contract’).

The following table shows the total amounts of unreformed contracts and those with appropriate fallback language
at 27 September 2020 and at 26 September 2021. The amounts of financial liabilities are shown at their carrying
amounts and derivatives are shown at their notional amounts.

**Security**

The revolving credit facility; senior secured notes; privately placed notes; euro floating notes and second lien facility
borrowings are governed by debentures pursuant to English law incorporating customary fixed and floating charge
security over the assets of the charging companies being Stonegate Pub Company Limited and certain of its
subsidiaries, deemed the Restricted Group, and Cayman Islands law governed equitable share mortgages over the
shares of Stonegate Pub Company Limited and certain other members of the Restricted Group incorporated under
the laws of the Cayman Islands.

Unique Pub Properties Limited is not deemed a Restricted Subsidiary as its assets are secured by way of fixed charge
for the benefit of its bond holders within its securitisation structure. The security pledged for the securitised bonds
is collectively over the whole securitisation incorporating a first fixed charge in favour of the Trustee over the Issuer’s
right, title, interest and benefit, present and future to all properties, cash, eligible investments and income generated
by Unique Pub Properties Limited.

The total value of assets within the Group secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 26 September 2021 is
property, plant and equipment £3,041 million (2020: £3,056 million), investment property £138 million (2020: £104
million) and non-current assets held for sale £19 million (2020: £40 million).

**Covenants**

The Group is subject to a number of financial covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities. There are four
covenants that relate to the debt as follows:

Two of the covenants relate to the securitised bonds and are tested and reported at each quarter end. The Debt
Service Cover Ratio (DSCR) measures the ability of the securitised group to meet its debt service whilst the Net Worth
covenant in the securitised group must be at least £300 million. During the prior period Bondholder consent was
sought for an amendment to the Debt Service Cover Ratio covenant allowing current year EBITDA to be substituted
for prior year EBITDA for the June 2020 and September 2020 quarters for any pubs closed due to Covid-19. This
mechanic benefitted the covenant calculation again through to Q3 of the current financial year. The Group has met
both covenants during the financial year.

The other two covenants relate to the RCF. These comprise a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio that is tested
quarterly and a Minimum Liquidity covenant that is tested monthly whilst the RCF is more than 40% drawn. During
the prior period Management sought a waiver such that the EBITDA used in the net leverage ratio calculation was
fixed at a pre-agreed level. This waiver was extended further during the current year and expired following the end
of Q3. The Group met both covenants during the year.

**Currency risk**
All of the revenues and the majority of the costs of the Group are in sterling. The Group uses cross currency interest
rate swaps to manage exposure to the impact of currency risk from its debt denominated in euros.

**Credit risk**

The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an expected credit loss (ECL)
provision. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure the expected lifetime credit losses
on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic bad debt experience to create an
ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the reporting date. The Group writes off its
trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the debt. The carrying amount of financial
assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

The ageing of trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date, gross of the doubtful debt provision, is as
follows:

**26 September 27 September**

**2021** 2020

**£m** £m

Not past due **43** 47

_Impacts for the period_

The Group follows the same basis of categorisation to both free hold property and leasehold property to determine
where to present assets on the balance sheet and therefore right of use assets are recognised in investment
property, non-current assets held for sale and property, plant and equipment depending on the type of sub lease
(where it is sub let) or the commitment to dispose of the property/lease. The following table sets out the movement

In relation to those leases under IFRS 16, for the 52 weeks ending 26 September 2021, the Group’s operating profit
metric improved by £33 million (2020: £21 million) as the new depreciation expense is lower than the IAS 17
operating lease charge; however net finance costs are higher than this, at £49 million (2020: £39 million), such that
net profit after tax is lower (2020: lower) compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis. Operating profit before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment and loss on sale of non-current assets is higher (2020: higher) compared to
the previous IAS 17 reporting basis.

**Leases as a lessor**

The Group leases a proportion of its properties to tenants. The majority of lease agreements have terms of between
one and 30 years, most of the leases with terms of over three years include RPI or CPI base rent adjustments and
provisions for rent reviews on either a three year or five year basis. Where the Group is the intermediate lessor the
sublease is classified as a finance lease by reference to the right of use asset, all other leases are classified as
operating leases.

**_Defined contribution pension schemes_**

The Group operates three defined contribution stakeholder schemes for certain employees. The pension cost charge
for the period represents contributions payable by the Group to the schemes and amounted to £5 million (2020: £4
million) At the period end the Group had outstanding contributions payable to the schemes of £Nil (2020: £Nil).

**_Defined benefit pension schemes_**

On 21 June 2011, as part of the Plato Company 3 acquisition the Group acquired two defined benefit schemes, the
Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension scheme, which are closed to new members and closed to
further accruals for existing members. The assets of the schemes are held in single, separate trustee administered
funds.

A full actuarial valuation for the Laurel Pub Pension scheme was carried out as at 29 February 2020. For the purposes
of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 29 February 2020, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary,
has been updated on an approximate basis to 26 September 2021.

A full actuarial valuation for the Yates Group Pension scheme was carried out as at 29 February 2020. For the
purposes of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 29 February 2020, which was carried out by a qualified independent
actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 26 September 2021.

The following tables illustrate the impact of both the Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension
scheme on the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (SOCI) and
the consolidated balance sheet.

The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:

**Net retirement benefit surplus recognised in the balance sheet** **1** 1

**Total net retirement benefit recognised in the balance sheet** **(10)** (6)

As the Group has concluded there is no unconditional right to a surplus on wind up, the net deficit on the Laurel Pub
Pension scheme has been recognised at the present value of minimum funding requirements.

At the end of the life of the Yates Group Pension scheme, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund and
any such refund would be paid out only on a net of tax basis.

The Group has agreed with the trustees of the Laurel Pub Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by
the payment of annual contributions of £2 million each year until 2026. The Group will meet the other annual fees
and expenses (excluding the annual PPF levy) incurred by the scheme subject to a cap of £270,000 per scheme year.

The full actuarial valuation of the Yates Group Pension scheme showed a deficit of £3 million. The Group has agreed
with the trustees of the Yates Group Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit over a period of 3 years
by the payment of annual contributions of £500,000 per annum.

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on
standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions
are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows:

**26 September 27 September**

**2021** 2020

Male retiring in 2021 **21.4 years** 21.0 years

Female retiring in 2021 **23.1 years** 23.0 years

Male retiring in 2046 **23.1 years** 22.8 years

Female retiring in 2046 **25.0 years** 24.9 years

The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the period end were as follows:

**26 September 27 September**

**2021** 2020

**Laurel Pub Pension Scheme**
Discount rate **1.9%** 1.6%

Rate of increase in pension payment **3.2%** 2.8%

Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is set
out below:

Impact on scheme liabilities

**26 September 27 September**

**2021** 2020

Change in assumption **£m** £m

**Laurel Pub Pension Scheme**
Discount rate Increase of 0.10% p.a. **(2)** (2)

Rate of inflation Increase of 0.10% p.a. **2** 2

Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year **3** 4

**Yates Group Pension Scheme**
Discount rate Increase of 0.25% p.a. **-** 
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% p.a. **-** 
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year **-** 
The sensitivities shown above are approximate. Each sensitivity considers one change in isolation. The inflation
sensitivity includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation and pension increases. The average
duration of the defined benefit obligation at the period ending 26 September 2021 is 19 years for the Laurel Pub
Pension scheme (2020: 19 years) and 14 years for the Yates Group Pension scheme (2020: 12 years).

The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and
longevity risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result
in an increase to plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to
increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of
the plan’s bond holdings. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the Yates Group Pension
scheme against extreme inflation.

During the period ended 29 September 2019; the Group established a management incentive plan to reward certain
employees, including directors and managers, for their future service. Under the plan those employees will realise a
gain only if there is a growth in the equity value of the business (subject to certain ‘ratchets’) and only if an exit event
occurs. The award has been classified as equity-settled. An exit event would occur either upon an initial public
offering of the Stonegate group (‘IPO’) or some other form of sale (e.g. to a trade buyer).

In the current period, on 8 January 2021 the scheme was replaced with a new management incentive plan so that it
also included certain legacy EIG employees and new Stonegate employees, alongside a change to the quantum of
returns at an exit event following the acquisition of EI Group. The scheme is operated by the Group’s ultimate owners
and was established through subscription to shares in the Group’s parent company, Stonegate Pub Company
Holdings Limited. A total of 1.8 million shares have been issued at an aggregate price of £19.9 million (£10.93 per
share).

In order to determine the fair value at the date of replacement, Management have engaged a third party to value
the MIP immediately before and after the replacement. The value, determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, is
£13.5 million, which is an uplift of £2.1 million for new members and £2.8 million for the change in return
parameters. No dividends will accrue under this award.

**Notes (continued)**

**29** **Management Incentive Plan (continued)**

There is inherent uncertainty in determining a suitable vesting period given that an exit event, whilst within the
control of the Group’s ultimate owners, may not happen for many years if at all. However, for the purposes of
considering the impact of IFRS 2, the directors have used a vesting period of 5 years. As a result, a charge of £1
million (2020: £Nil) has been recognised as an equity settled share based payment expense in the income statement.

There are no other share based payment schemes.

**30** **Ultimate parent undertaking**

The ultimate parent company is Stonegate Pub Company Topco Sarl, a company incorporated in Luxembourg. The
ultimate controlling party is TDR Capital Stonegate L.P., an investment fund managed by TDR Capital LLP, a private
equity management firm.

**31** **Post balance sheet events**

Subsequent to the period end on 22 December 2021, the Group has modified its second lien and revolving credit
floating-rate facilities indexed to sterling LIBOR to reference SONIA as a result of the global reform of interest rate
benchmarking.

Also subsequent to the period end on 10 January 2022 the Group acquired the remaining 25% of shares in Hippo
Inns Limited, a joint venture for £1.5 million. Hippo Inns comprises 12 high quality pubs located in prime London and
Greater London neighbourhoods and are known for their premium food offer.
