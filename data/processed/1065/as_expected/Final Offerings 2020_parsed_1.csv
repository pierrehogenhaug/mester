The Floating Rate Notes and the New Fixed Rate Notes will mature on July 31, 2025. The Issuer is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Holdings Limited (“Holdco”), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The gross proceeds from the offering of the New Notes (the “Offering”) will be used to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Bridge Facilities (as defined herein) and £273 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities (as defined herein). See “Use of Proceeds.” The New Fixed Rate Notes will be issued as Additional Notes under the indenture entered into by the Issuer on July 13, 2020 (the “Indenture”) pursuant to which the Issuer issued its £500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8% senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Existing Fixed Rate Notes”). The Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the New Fixed Rate Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Fixed Rate Notes” and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the New Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Notes.” Except as otherwise specified with respect to the New Fixed Rate Notes, the New Fixed Rate Notes will have the same terms as the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and will constitute a single class of debt securities with the Existing Fixed Rate Notes under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers, amendments and offers to purchase. However, the New Fixed Rate Notes will not form part of the same series of notes as the Existing Fixed Rate Notes. The New Fixed Rate Notes offered hereby will bear a different rate of interest to the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and will have new international securities identification numbers (the “ISINs”) and common codes, and will not be fungible with the Existing Fixed Rate Notes. See “Description of the Notes.” The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, commencing on November 15, 2020. The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Notes on or after July 31, 2021, at the redemption prices set out in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to July 31, 2021, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a “make whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer will pay interest on the New Fixed Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2021. The Issuer may redeem some or all of the New Fixed Rate Notes on or after July 31, 2022, at the redemption prices set out in this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to July 31, 2022, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the New Fixed Rate Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a “make whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to July 31, 2022, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the New Fixed Rate Notes (including any additional New Fixed Rate Notes) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a price equal to 108.25% of the principal amount of the New Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the New Fixed Rate Notes (not including any additional New Fixed Rate Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption. The Issuer may redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer may be required to offer to redeem the Notes at 101% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if certain consolidated leverage ratios are not exceeded in connection with such an event. The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are, and on the Issue Date the New Notes will be, senior obligations of the Issuer, and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes rank, and on the Issue Date the New Notes will rank, equally in right of payment with all unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, senior to all indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and effectively senior to all unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the assets securing the Notes. The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are, and on or about the Issue Date, the New Notes will be, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Stonegate Pub Company Limited (the “Parent”) and its material subsidiaries (including Ei and certain of its subsidiaries) (the “Guarantors”). The guarantee of the Notes by each Guarantor (a “Note Guarantee” and, collectively, the “Note Guarantees”), in the case of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, ranks, and in the case of the New Notes, will rank, equally in right of payment with all the existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor, senior to all the existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the assets securing such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The Note Guarantees, in the case of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes are, and in the case of the New Notes will be, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.” The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are, and upon their issuance and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the applicable Security Documents (as defined herein) and Permitted Collateral Liens (as defined herein), the New Notes will be, secured by certain material assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The Collateral (as defined herein) also secures obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement (as defined herein), the Senior Term Facilities Agreement (as defined herein) and the Second Lien Facility Agreement (as defined herein). Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements (as defined herein) and any Operating Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) that are secured by assets that also secure obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. There is currently no public market for the New Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of the New Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and admission to trade on the Exchange.

However, the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and has not been independently verified. Additionally, industry publications and such studies generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy or completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances the sources do not assume liability for such information. We have obtained certain of the market and industry data presented in this Offering Memorandum from reports produced by third-party industry specialists such as the British Beer and Pub Association (“BBPA”), CGA and Experian, and we have obtained consent from them to reproduce certain of their non-public data in this Offering Memorandum. We cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such data, and we have not independently verified such market data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. We do, however, accept responsibility for the correct reproduction of this information. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pubs and bars sector in the United Kingdom has been adversely affected. Accordingly, the industry publications, surveys or studies by third-party data providers referred to in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect certain aspects of the pubs and bars sector in the United Kingdom as they may not contemplate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, market or industry forecasts referred to in this Offering Memorandum have not been revised in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK pubs and bars sector, and we cannot assure you that these forecasts will remain relevant, and will not be subject to change, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this sector become more apparent. Some of the information herein has been extrapolated from such market data or reports using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the industry in which we operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our experience, internal studies and estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions. We believe that such information and statements are true and accurate, but there can be no assurance that is the case. Such information and statements have not been verified by any independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding such information, statements and any similar data presented herein, such information, statements or similar data are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information or statements in this Offering Memorandum. Further, in this Offering Memorandum, we make statements about our market positioning relative to other pub operators, and we also present comparative data of certain of our peer pub operators. These statements are generally based on our experience, internal studies and estimates, and our own evaluation of our competitors in the market. In general, we have identified our main competitors as the largest pub vii ----- operators in the United Kingdom by number of pubs. Where we present comparative data of certain of these peer pub operators, we have derived such data from the publicly available information of these peer pub operators or industry publications, surveys or studies by third-party data providers. In addition, the like for like sales growth data of certain of our peers that we present in this Offering Memorandum is comprised of the aggregate weekly drinks, sales, admissions and accommodations sales for the period presented rather than total revenue. Accordingly, for consistency, we compare the like for like sales data of our peers against the Stonegate Group Adjusted Revenue Growth (Like for Like) rather than the Stonegate Group Revenue Growth (Like for Like). While Stonegate Group’s and its peers’ definition of like for like sales growth is generally comparable, the methodology used by our peers in calculating like for like sales growth may differ in certain respects amongst one another and from our methodology for calculating the Stonegate Group Adjusted Revenue Growth (Like for Like). We cannot guarantee that the comparative peer data that we present in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared or presented on a comparable basis to our own key operating information. We cannot guarantee that the comparative peer data that we present in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared or presented on a comparable basis to our own key operating information. We also cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such comparative peer data, and we have not independently verified or reviewed such peer data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. Accordingly, the comparative peer data presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution, as such information may not be directly comparable to our own key operating information.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.10,Presentation of Financial and Other Information IFRS Financial Information,3.10.1,Stonegate Group,"In this Offering Memorandum, we have presented Stonegate Group’s audited consolidated financial information as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, which we have derived from the directors’ reports and financial statements for these periods prepared by Stonegate Group. We have included Stonegate Group’s audited consolidated financial statements for these periods elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum but have not included the accompanying directors’ reports in this Offering Memorandum. In this Offering Memorandum, we have also presented Stonegate Group’s (i) unaudited condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 and January 19, 2020, which we have derived from Stonegate Group’s non-statutory condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 and (ii) unaudited condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 and April 12, 2020, which we have derived from Stonegate Group’s non-statutory condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information mentioned above are presented in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Stonegate Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated cash flow statements and the related notes, were audited by KPMG LLP, Stonegate Group’s independent auditors and KPMG LLP’s audit opinions for these periods are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In this Offering Memorandum, we have not included separate financial information for the Issuer. The Issuer was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on July 9, 2019, as a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Holdco and an indirect subsidiary of the Parent, to facilitate the offering of debt securities. The Issuer has no business operations or material assets, other than its rights under the Existing Proceeds Loans pursuant to the Existing Proceeds Loan Agreements and, following the issuance of the New Notes and the use of proceeds thereof, will have no business operations or material assets, other than its rights under the New Proceeds Loans pursuant to the New Proceeds Loan Agreements. Stonegate Group’s financial year accounting periods run from the calendar day following the previous financial year end, which, for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 were September 26, 2016, September 25, 2017 and October 1, 2018, respectively, to the Sunday nearest to its accounting reference date. Accordingly, from time to time, Stonegate Group’s financial year accounting period covers a 53-week period instead of a 52-week period. For instance, Stonegate Group’s financial year accounting period for 2018 was 53 weeks, whereas for 2017 and 2019, it was 52 weeks. Consequently, the results for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 were positively impacted by an additional week’s trading relative to the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 and the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, which impacts the comparability of results over these periods. In addition, the results of operations for prior years or interim periods may not be necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full-year or any future period. Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information includes the financial information of Ei Group from and including March 3, 2020, the date on which the Transaction was completed. For the financial periods preceding March 3, 2020, Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information does not include the financial information of Ei Group. Accordingly, Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 may not be comparable to Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019. IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year commencing on or after that date. Stonegate Group’s first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS 16 began September 30, 2019. Accordingly, Stonegate Group has applied IFRS 16 for the financial periods beginning September 30, 2019. Stonegate Group has adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information for previous years is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to its financial statement for the periods prior to xviii ----- the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. However, certain financial information as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 is presented in this Offering Memorandum on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, to provide a meaningful basis for comparing its financial statements with prior periods. See “Summary—Stonegate Group’s Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other Information” and “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Policy.” In this Offering Memorandum we have also presented certain unaudited revenue information relating to Stonegate Group’s branded and unbranded groups of pubs and current formats for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, as well as for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 and the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, which we refer to as Stonegate Group Branded Revenue and Stonegate Group Unbranded Revenue in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, in this Offering Memorandum we have presented certain unaudited income statement information, as well as certain other financial and operating information of Stonegate Group, for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. This information was derived by adding the relevant item for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 and for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, and subtracting the relevant item for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019. This information for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors. _Segment Reporting_ Following the completion of the Transaction and beginning the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, we have introduced three reportable segments. These are as follows: - Publican Partnerships, covering rental income and revenue from supply of drinks and gaming machines from our Publican Partnerships; - Commercial Properties, covering rental income from our Commercial Properties; and - Managed, covering revenue from the sale of food, drink, accommodation and gaming machine income from our Managed Pubs and Managed Investments. Note 2 of our financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum presents revenue, underlying EBITDA and certain other metrics by reporting segment. We eliminate intersegment revenues and costs upon consolidation and the segmental note is presented net of these eliminations. All of our revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is not further segmented based on location. Therefore, no geographical segmental analysis has been provided.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

We have also presented in this Offering Memorandum, unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for Ei Group as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019, which we have derived from its condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 that have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS as adopted by the European Union and are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Ei Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, were audited by Ernst & Young LLP, its independent auditors and Ernst & Young LLP’s audit opinions for these periods are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year commencing on or after that date. Ei Group’s first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS 16 began October 1, 2019. Accordingly, Ei Group has applied IFRS 16 for financial periods beginning October 1, 2019. Ei Group has adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information for previous years is not restated and, as a result, no xix ----- IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to its financial statement for the periods prior to the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019. However, certain of its financial information as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 and the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 is presented in this Offering Memorandum on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, to provide a meaningful basis for comparing its financial statements with prior periods. See “Summary—Ei Group’s Summary Historical Financial and Other Information” and “Ei Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Ei Group’s Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Policy.” In addition, we have presented in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited condensed consolidated income statement information, as well as certain other financial and operating information of Ei Group, for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019. This information was derived by adding the relevant item for the year ended September 30, 2019 and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), and subtracting the relevant item for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. This information for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of Ei Group’s financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by its auditors. We have also presented in this Offering Memorandum certain select financial information of Ei Group for the period between December 29, 2019 to March 2, 2020, representing the period commencing after the end of its first trading quarter of 2020 and ending on the date prior to the date of the completion of the Transaction, after which its results were consolidated with Stonegate Group’s results. Comparability of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s interim financial results for the first quarter of the financial year 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum is impacted by the varying lengths of their respective trading quarters. Stonegate Group’s first trading quarter for the financial year 2020 is made up of 16 weeks. Ei Group’s first trading quarter for the financial year 2020 is made up of 13 weeks. For this reason, Stonegate Group’s results for the first quarter of financial year 2020, which reflects an additional three weeks of trading results, may not be directly comparable to Ei Group’s results for the first quarter of the financial year 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Accordingly, not every pub that is trading during a period for which we present one of these measures is included in the result presented for that period. For example, for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, 97 of our pubs were not included in the calculation of these measures.

Where we present the Stonegate Group Return on Investment in this Offering Memorandum, we have not included in the calculation the results of pubs that have traded for fewer than 52 weeks post investment. For example, for the 156 weeks ended April 12, 2020, 116 pubs that we have invested in have not been included in the calculation of the Stonegate Group Return on Investment because those pubs have not traded for the 52 weeks post investment.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.13,Valuation,3.13.1,Stonegate Group Valuation,"Davis Coffer Lyons (“DCL”) has prepared a desktop valuation report dated November 25, 2019 in respect of our portfolio of 761 freehold and leasehold properties as of September 29, 2019 (the “Stonegate Group Valuation Report”), in accordance with the IVS International Valuation Standards published in January 2017 and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Global Standards 2017 (the “RICS Standards”). As of September 29, 2019, our property portfolio consisted of 763 sites, and we subsequently disposed of two sites. The Stonegate Group Valuation Report excluded these two sites and valued 761 sites as of September 29, 2019. DCL has prepared its valuation on the basis of “Market Value,” which is defined by the RICS Standards as: “The estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.” The valuation presented in the Stonegate Group Valuation Report is the aggregate of the Market Value of each individual property as a fully equipped operational entity on a fair maintainable trade basis and does not represent a valuation of the business as a whole or the value of the various brands associated with our operations. Based on the RICS Standards, the valuation of a property valued as an operational entity includes the legal interest in the land and buildings; the trade inventory, usually comprising all trade fixtures, fittings, furnishings and equipment; and the market’s perception of the trading potential, together with an assumed ability to obtain or renew existing licenses, consents, certificates and permits. In valuing each individual property, consumables and stock in trade are excluded. In preparing the Stonegate Group Valuation Report, DCL has primarily adopted a profits approach to valuation, which involves a consideration of the trading performance of the business on a fair maintainable trade and operating profit basis assuming a reasonably efficient operator. The Stonegate Group Valuation Report notes that no adjustment has been made to the valuation figure for any expenses of realization in the event of a sale, or to reflect the balance of any outstanding mortgages, either in respect of capital or interest accrued thereon. Nor are costs of acquisition included in the Stonegate Group Valuation Report. Further, in preparing the valuation, no allowances were made for any liability which may arise for payment of corporation tax or capital gains tax, or any other property or business-related related tax, whether existing or which may arise on development or disposal, deemed or otherwise. DCL has carried out their desktop valuation based upon information supplied by us, which they have assumed to be correct and comprehensive. In particular, DCL: - has not measured the properties but has relied upon the floor areas provided by us; - has only undertaken inspections of approximately 10% of the total portfolio of properties covered in the Stonegate Group Valuation Report; - has not carried out any investigations into the past or present uses of the properties, nor of any neighboring land, in order to establish whether there is any potential for contamination and have therefore assumed that none exists; - has not undertaken structural surveys and has not inspected any part of the properties that are covered, unexposed or inaccessible, or tested any of the electrical, heating, drainage or other services, and no assurance is given that the properties are free from defect; - has assumed that all properties are free from all deleterious materials; - has assumed that all properties are occupied and that they trade in accordance with the required building, planning and building regulation requirements and has not undertaken planning enquiries; and xxiii ----- - except as advised by us, has assumed that the leases granted in respect of the properties have the benefit of security of tenure.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.13,Valuation,3.13.2,Ei Group Valuations,"Valuations of Ei Group’s estate are carried out on an annual basis as of the end date of each financial year. With the exception of properties identified for disposal and transferred to non-current assets held for sale, Ei Group’s properties were revalued as of September 30, 2019 by Avison Young/GVA Grimley Limited (“Avison Young”), in respect of properties that secure the Ei Corporate Bonds and by Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP, Independent Chartered Surveyors (“Colliers”), in respect of the properties of Unique Group, together constituting in aggregate 95% of the property portfolio. The remaining property portfolio of Ei Group was valued by Ei Group’s internal Estates Director. All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations (i.e. for assets whose fair value cannot be determined by using observable inputs or measures) as there are not directly comparable market observable inputs. Property assets recognized as licensed land and buildings in property, plant and equipment were valued using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) capitalized at an appropriate rate of return (as defined within RICS Standards) or an equivalent multiple. This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future trading potential. This assessment of profit is then capitalized at an appropriate multiple to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings. The valuation of the managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent approach that effectively capitalizes the net income attributable to Ei Group from operating the pub at an appropriate multiple. Property assets held in investment property include free-of-tie pubs let to tenants at open market rents and non-pub assets, which are predominantly let as convenience stores. These assets have been valued adopting the investment method of valuation. By reference to the rents, fixed lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value. All classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. Under IFRS 13, Ei Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximize the value of the asset. In conducting their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value where applicable. This is applicable on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a higher and better use. In the current year the highest and best use of all the property assets in property, plant and equipment and investment property has been assessed as their existing use. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Valuation Reports in respect of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s property portfolio are correct, accurate or complete.” For additional information regarding the valuations of Ei Group’s assets, see Notes 17 and 18 to the financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018, and Notes 16 and 17 to the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2019. Avison Young has prepared valuation reports dated October 24, 2019 in respect of Ei Group’s properties that secure the Ei Corporate Bonds and Colliers has prepared a valuation report dated November 8, 2019 in respect of Unique Group’s properties (collectively, the “Ei Group Valuation Reports” and, together with the Stonegate Group Valuation Reports, the “Valuation Reports”), in each case, in respect of the applicable property portfolio as of September 30, 2019 and in accordance with the RICS Standards. Avison Young has carried out an on-site review of 356 out of 1,771 properties covered by it in its report, with the remaining properties valued on the basis of a desktop review. Similarly, Colliers has carried out an on-site review of 375 out of 1,860 properties covered by it in its report, with the remaining properties valued on the basis of a desktop review. Ei Group Valuation Reports have been prepared in accordance with the definition of “Market Value” consistent with the RICS Standards (as described above) and on the basis of individual valuation of the properties, having reference to the occupational agreements, which are, or could be, put in place. The Ei Group Valuation Reports note that most of the occupational agreements for the relevant properties include a tie arrangement for the supply of beers and other drinks, and make an assumption that a potential buyer of the properties is able to leverage the tie and negotiate commercial terms with brewers xxiv ----- and other suppliers which are at least equal to those enjoyed by Ei Group. For the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment, the Ei Group Valuation Reports disregard any internal or intercompany leases which may currently exist. For those properties which are currently vacant, closed or let on temporary agreements, the Ei Group Valuation Reports assume that the properties will be let on substantive tied occupational agreements which, so far as is possible, are not at risk of losing the tie pursuant to exercise of market rent only (“MRO”) options. Ei Group Valuation Reports assume that Ei Group has supplied all information that has a material effect upon the value of the relevant properties and that this information is accurate and can, if necessary, be verified. In particular, as described in the Ei Group Valuation Reports, Avison Young and/or Colliers: - have assumed that the buildings are capable of being insured by reputable insurers at reasonable market rates; - have not made any allowance for legal fees or any other costs or expenses which would be incurred on the sale of the property; - have not undertaken any form of technical, building or deleterious material survey and have not reviewed, or given warranties as to, the condition of the structure, foundations, soil and services; - have not provided a formal environmental assessment and have not carried out any soil, geological or other tests or surveys in order to ascertain the site conditions or other environmental conditions of the property; - have disregarded the value of all process related plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings and those items which are in the nature of occupiers’ trade fittings and equipment; and - have assumed that the property is constructed, used and occupied in full compliance with the relevant planning and building regulation approvals and that there are no outstanding notices, conditions, breaches, contraventions, non-compliance, appeals, challenges or judicial review. The Valuation Reports are based on a desktop valuation of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s relevant portfolio of freehold and leasehold properties. As a result of the restricted due diligence and lack of property inspections, each of DCL, Avison Young and Colliers has made certain assumptions in order to value the relevant properties. If a valuation with the benefit of full inspections took place, then the assumptions adopted may have been different and, as a result, the reported valuation could be materially different to those reported in the relevant Valuation Reports. For this reason, you should not, and are not entitled to, rely upon the valuation taken from the Valuation Reports and reported in this Offering Memorandum for the purposes of making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. After the issuance of the New Notes, neither third parties nor we will provide the holders of Notes with revised valuations and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such valuation under any circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Valuation Reports in respect of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s property portfolio are correct, accurate or complete.” All conclusions presented in the Valuation Reports are based on information available at the time of review. Changes in factors upon which the review was based could affect the results. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in a decline in our freehold and leasehold property values. We have recognized £24 million of impairment charge for property, plant and equipment during the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds. However, the Stonegate Group Property Asset Value and Ei Group Property Asset Value presented in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted for any potential decline in property values due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Leasing and ownership of a significant portfolio of real estate exposes us to possible impairments, liabilities and loses.” Forecasts are inherently uncertain because of events or combinations of events that cannot reasonably be foreseen, including the actions of government, individuals, third parties and competitors. See “Forward-looking Statements.” Data based on the Valuation Reports that is included in this Offering Memorandum involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on a variety of external factors, including those discussed in “Risk Factors.” xxv -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Prior to the Transaction, Ei Group was the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on number of sites with 1 ----- 4,028 sites across England and Wales as of December 28, 2019. The Ei Group Property Asset Value was £3,289 million as of September 30, 2019. Its estate consists of high-quality assets, approximately 95% of which, based on value, were freehold properties and approximately 25% of which were located in town centers as of September 30, 2019. Ei Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the year ended September 30, 2019 were £724 million, £247 million and £209 million, respectively. Its revenue for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 was £724 million and the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 was £263 million (adjusted for Ei Group’s disposal of 355 commercial properties and 124 assets in the ordinary course in the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 described in this Offering Memorandum). Ei Group operated three main business segments: publican partnerships, managed pubs and commercial properties. - _Ei Group Publican Partnerships: Under this segment, Ei Group operated in the leased and tenanted sector through 3,351 pubs, which accounted for approximately 83% of its estate (based on the number of pubs) as of December 28, 2019. - _Ei Group Managed Pubs: Under this segment, Ei Group operated two divisions, its Managed Operations division and its Managed Investments division. Its Managed Operations division consisted of 62 pubs as of December 28, 2019 operating under the Bermondsey Pub Company format (covering fully-managed pubs operating nationally with a drink-led retail offering) and 357 pubs as of December 28, 2019 under the Craft Union Pub Company format (covering generally smaller operations run by self-employed operators with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but no food offering). Its Managed Investments division consisted of 75 pubs as of December 28, 2019, operated as joint ventures with experienced retail partners reflecting a broad mix of operating styles. - _Ei Group Commercial Properties: Under this segment, Ei Group had a portfolio of 147 assets as of December 28, 2019, which it operated on a ‘free-of-tie’ basis. The assets in the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment contributed to the diversification of Ei Group’s earnings profile and provided additional recurring rental income.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.2,Stonegate Group,"Stonegate Group began its trading operations in November 2010 with the acquisition of 333 pubs from Mitchells & Butlers. Prior to the Transaction, Stonegate Group was the fourth largest managed pub company in the United Kingdom based on number of sites, trading from 760 sites across the United Kingdom as of January 19, 2020. Stonegate Group Property Asset Value was estimated to be £798 million as of September 19, 2019 and its estate included 251 freehold properties as of that date. Stonegate Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 were £853 million, £19 million and £24 million, respectively. Its revenue for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 was £874 million and Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 was £141 million. Stonegate Group’s business is highly diversified with a variety of formats. Stonegate Group classifies its pubs as either “branded” or “unbranded”, based on each pub’s concept and offering. Its branded pubs consist of Be at One, Slug and Lettuce and Venues brands, while its unbranded pubs consist of Proper Pubs, Town Pub and Kitchen, Common Rooms, Classic Inns pubs and City Taverns. By operating its business through a multi-format strategy, Stonegate Group has successfully positioned itself to attract a wide customer demographic while being able to cater to various consumer trends. This diversity in formats and offerings allows it to exist in multiple sites across city and town centers without adversely affecting sales at its pubs in adjacent locations, as opposed to single format operators.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.3,Combined Group,"We believe that the Transaction results in a more resilient business for the combined group due to the combined group’s diversified operating models comprising publican partnerships, managed pubs and commercial properties, significant asset backing, strong purchasing power based on larger scale, all of which is complemented by Stonegate Group’s ability to deliver a market-leading operating performance across the Ei Group’s managed estate and publican partnership sites with the potential for conversion to Stonegate Group’s managed formats. 2 ----- The combined group has three main segments: - _Publican Partnerships: Publican partnerships form a core operating segment of the combined group, made up of pubs owned or leased by the combined group and operated by publicans as their own businesses. A key feature of the publican partnerships operating model is “tie” arrangements, whereby most publicans have agreed under their lease or tenancy agreements to purchase beer and other beverages through us. We intend to continue to maintain these tie arrangements which, along with rental income, provide resilient and recurring earnings. - _Managed Pubs: Managed pubs are largely managed and operated by the combined group and derive their income predominantly from the retail sale of food and drinks, accommodation and gaming machines. The exception being pubs operated under the Craft Union Pub Company format, which are generally smaller operations managed and operated by self-employed operators under our guidelines for managed pub operations, with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but no food offering. Our managed pubs are strategically positioned to cater to different customer demographics and price points. Stonegate Group’s managed estate forms the majority of the combined group’s portfolio of managed pubs. - _Commercial Properties: Commercial properties consist of free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties operated and managed by third-party leaseholders. Commercial properties derive their income predominantly from rental payments and contribute to the diversification of earnings by providing another source of recurring rental income. From time to time, we expect to be able to monetize the value created in commercial properties at attractive multiples.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.4,,"On March 3, 2020, we completed the Transaction and Ei Group was combined with Stonegate Group. Following the Transaction, on a combined basis, we are the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites (4,749 sites on a combined basis as of April 12, 2020). The combined group has strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties (approximately 81% by number of sites and approximately 88% by value on a combined basis as of September 30, 2019) and a combined property asset value of approximately £4.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 (Stonegate Group: £798 million; Ei Group: £3.3 billion). The combined group is well-distributed through the United Kingdom, with a majority of pubs located at high street locations across London and the southeast region of the United Kingdom, and has diverse operating models, formats and brands. Revenue of the combined group is generated from a variety of sources, including drink and food sales (87.6% of pro forma revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019) and rental income (8.6% of pro forma revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019). We believe that our diverse and agile business that delivers across operating models, formats and brands, led by Stonegate Group’s experienced and reputed management team, will be instrumental in driving revenue growth in the future. Stonegate Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 were £853 million, £19 million and £24 million, respectively, and Ei Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the year ended September 30, 2019 were £724 million, £247 million and £209 million, respectively. On a combined basis, Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, was £1,598 million. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) on a combined basis for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 would have been £494 million. We had strong strategic reasons to combine Stonegate Group and Ei Group. The Transaction adds Ei Group’s strong and stable publican partnership business to Stonegate Group’s leading managed pub business. It provides a significant pipeline of publican partnership pubs that we can convert into managed pubs where we identify value accretive opportunities. The scale of the combined operations presents numerous opportunities, including opportunities to realize significant cost savings through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group. This combination also gives us the ability to take advantage of value arbitrage opportunities that may not have been fully exploited by Ei Group before. The global outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus and the disease it causes (“COVID-19”) have had a significant effect on our industry and our business. It resulted in the UK government taking unprecedented steps to implement a national lockdown, restricting social gatherings and mandating closure of non-essential businesses, in each case, leading to business slowdowns and shutdowns. Pursuant to a directive of the UK government, our pubs closed for business on March 20, 2020 as part of national efforts to curb the spread of the disease. Our pubs reopened for business on July 4, 2020, and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 77% of our managed pubs subject to government guidance. Late night formats where dancing is a key part of the offer, pubs aimed at the student demographic and most of our Be At One pubs remain closed during this initial phase of reopening. As of July 19, 2020, we believe that our publicans had reopened an estimated 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate. While we have seen certain positive early results based on our first week of trading after reopening, the impact of COVID-19 on our industry and our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and cannot be accurately predicted at this time.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Diverse and market-leading business in the UK pub sector,"Combining the inherent strengths of Ei Group and Stonegate Group, we expect to create a diverse and market-leading business in the UK pub sector. Ei Group brings a high-quality and sustainable pub estate. The quality of its estate is evident in its geographic distribution and overall profile. Geographically, its pubs are favorably weighted toward more profitable areas such as those across London, the southeast region of the United Kingdom and other key cities, large towns and affluent postcodes, which we believe provides higher rental income and higher drinks sales based on higher volume. In terms of estate profile, Ei Group has succeeded in rationalizing its underperforming publican partnership pubs by pursuing a strategy of disposing of a number of these pubs, having halved the size of its publican partnership estate in the last ten years (from 6,820 pubs in 2010 to 3,424 pubs in 2019) and, prior to the impact of COVID-19, we estimated that less than 4% of its publican partnership sites produced an average weekly take of less than £4,000. In recent years, based on the operational flexibility provided by its multi-model estate Ei Group has also succeeded in creating a sustainable pub estate by, among other things, reducing the number of its longer-term tied leases and increasing the proportion of its tied businesses operating under shorter-term tenancy agreements of up to five years in length. These attributes of Ei Group’s estate also make it well suited for conversions into Stonegate Group’s managed pubs format, which is characterized by pubs that are mainly high street and drink-led and weighted toward the southern region of the United Kingdom, and we expect Ei Group’s estate of publican partnership pubs to serve as a long-term pipeline for such conversions. Stonegate Group brings the experience of, and proven model for, running a successful managed pubs business. Its multi-format strategy is aimed at attracting a wide customer demographic while being able to cater to various consumer trends. It has consistently delivered high returns on investment (Stonegate Group Return on Investment of 35.7%, 35.3% and 35.4% for the 156 weeks ended September 29, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017). Its management, who are the architects of its managed business model, have the knowledge, skill set and experience to run not only a successful managed pubs business but also a publican partnerships business, many of them having spent time working in that area. By combining the strengths of both entities, we expect to deliver a diverse and market leading business in the UK pub sector. The combined group brings diversity in terms of income sources (rental income, wholesale drink sales and retail drink and food sales), locations (distribution throughout the United Kingdom with a weighting in more profitable areas such as London, the southeast region of the United 3 ----- Kingdom and city and town centers), operating models (leased and tenanted, managed and commercial properties) and formats (branded or unbranded, within the managed pubs segment). The combined group is the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites. As of April 12, 2020, the combined group had 4,749 sites, compared to 2,864 pubs as of March 31, 2020 for its closest competitor, Greene King plc. While Ei Group has delivered a significant increase in value since 2015, we believe that combining its estate with Stonegate Group’s managed pub business will help unlock the full potential and size of Ei Group’s managed pubs business. With the flexibility to apply the format best suited to the demographic trends or customer base of a certain area, we will be able to overlay the appropriate brands and formats across Ei Group’s portfolio to maximize the performance of the wider combined estate. Our multiple formats will allow us to maintain a significant presence in growing cities without adversely affecting sales at our pubs in adjacent locations, as opposed to single format operators catering to select target groups. With diversification and greater scale, we believe that the combined group is better positioned to compete effectively against other market participants, which would benefit all stakeholders, including tenants, employees, customers and local communities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,"Strong track record of successfully integrating acquisitions and creating value through cost savings, investments and operational enhancements","We have a strong track record of acquiring and integrating pubs. We have also succeeded in realizing notable cost savings based on our acquisitions. For example, the acquisitions of Bramwell (2013) and TCG (2015) delivered cost savings of £7 million and £2 million, respectively, on their twelve-month EBITDA at acquisition of approximately £12 million in each case. In addition to creating value through cost savings, we create value through making investments and operational enhancements in the pubs that we acquire. We have a demonstrable track record of successful capital investments. Since our inception in 2010 and through January 19, 2020, we have refurbished 621 Stonegate Group pubs that we currently operate and have delivered consistently high returns on investment (Stonegate Group Return on Investment of 35.7%, 35.3% and 35.4% for the 156 weeks ended September 29, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017). As of April 12, 2020, we had 124 Stonegate Group pubs in which we have not invested while under TDR Capital’s ownership, and we believe that this pipeline, taken together with the sizeable pipeline created by the Transaction, provides strong investment and growth opportunities in the future. We also expect to utilize our knowledge and experience of delivering high returns on investment in relation to acquisitions of under-invested portfolios. For example, in the case of investments we made in the pubs acquired from Bramwell, Maclay and TCG, we delivered returns on investment of 32%, 69% and 50%, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,Significant real estate backing with a majority freehold estate,"The combined group has strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominately freehold properties (approximately 81% by number of sites and approximately 88% by value on a combined basis as of September 30, 2019) and a combined property asset value of approximately £4.1 billion as of September 30, 2019. The Ei Group Property Asset Value was £3,289 million as of September 30, 2019, with its freehold assets accounting for 95% of its total estate based on value. The Ei Group estate is heavily weighted toward the southern region of England, with 52% of the Ei Group Publican Partnerships as of September 30, 2019 located in that region, where property prices are generally higher than the rest of the United Kingdom. Ei Group’s estate is largely well maintained. Its capital expenditures on maintenance were £37 million, £32 million and £32 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Ei Group has also demonstrated a strong track record of disposals at a significant premium to book value. Over the last ten financial years, Ei Group has disposed of 3,371 sites at an aggregate value of £1,474 million, representing an average premium to book value of 20%. A majority of these disposals were in respect of underperforming assets, indicating the potential for extracting significant value from strategic disposals in the future. The Stonegate Group Property Asset Value was estimated to be £798 million as of September 29, 2019, covering a managed estate of 760 pubs, comprised of 251 freehold properties. The freehold properties 4 ----- together represented approximately 59% of the Stonegate Group Property Asset Value. Stonegate Group’s pubs are also located at attractive geographic locations across the United Kingdom. As of January 19, 2020, 79% of the Stonegate Group sites were located in town or city centers, with the remaining 21% located in suburban areas. Stonegate Group has made substantial investments in its estate. The Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure taken together with the Stonegate Group Maintenance Capital Expenditure was £83 million, £71 million and £82 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, respectively. Management has concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a triggering event resulting in management performing an impairment of our property, plant and equipment in the second quarter of 2020. Accordingly, for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of £24 million. See “—Recent Developments—Impairment Review.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,Favorable cash conversion profile in a steady state of business,"Ei Group Cash Conversion was 86.6%, 88.9% and 88.9% for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, driven by its stable and recurring sources of income and steady increase in EBITDA per pub over time. Ei Group’s rental income and its margins from tied drinks sales provide a stable and recurring source of income. The Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth was 1.2%, 1.2% and 2.3% in the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Ei Group has also experienced continued growth in its EBITDA per pub since 2013, which has been driven mainly by format conversions, like for like growth across its estate and disposals of its underperforming assets. Ei Group Letting and Maintenance Capital Expenditure also remained broadly consistent over the last three financial years with £37 million, £32 million and £32 million for September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Stonegate Group Cash Conversion was 72.8%, 67.2% and 66.5% for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, respectively, driven by its growth over time and favorable returns on investment capital expenditures. The Stonegate Group Maintenance Capital Expenditure has also remained consistent over time (2019: £36 million, 2018: £37 million and 2017: £35 million). For the combined group, we have estimated that the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) would have been £494 million for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. We estimate that approximately £80 million of this amount will derive from cost savings that we expect to realize from the combination of Ei Group and Stonegate Group. Our cash conversion profile has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to a significant decline in our EBITDA due to the government-mandated closure of our pubs. In terms of capital expenditure, we currently intend to keep discretionary spending at a minimum, and until our cash reserves recover to desirable levels, we plan to make capital expenditure through a careful and considered approach. For a discussion of our short-term capital expenditure plans, see “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Stonegate Group Capital Expenditure.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,Well positioned to outperform in a stable and defensive market,"We believe that the combined group’s estate is optimally positioned to outperform in terms of market share based on revenue in a stable and defensive UK pub market. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading pub and bar operators delivered robust like for like sales growth, as consumers spent on low-priced items in leisure activities and transitioned to premium drinks, which typically provide higher profit margins. Price increases in the on-trade segment, greater range of products and the consumer trend in favor of premium products has resulted in an increase in the pub industry’s sales despite a decline in overall volumes. Consumers ordered products that are more expensive and spent more per transaction, as opposed to buying larger amounts of cheaper alcohol. This resulted in an increase in the value of sales in the UK on-trade food and drinks market to an estimated £55 billion in 2019, representing an increase of approximately 38% since 2010. Consumer demand for premium drinks such as craft beer, craft cider, micro-distillery spirits and premium mixers has also been increasing over time, with the best performing drinks categories being premium, while standard categories of drinks performed less favorably. Sales volumes of draught craft beer, gin, draught premium world lager and 5 ----- sparkling wines increased. Collectively, these changes generated higher profit margins for pub operators. If these trends continue once the industry returns to a steady state following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these trends for a number of reasons. The diversity of our formats and the range of our products provide us the agility to cater to developing consumer preferences, such as a higher demand for premium products, while also providing natural insulation against changes in consumer preferences. The geographic weighting of our pubs toward more profitable regions of the United Kingdom where revenues per pub are generally higher (e.g., London, the southeast region of the United Kingdom, city and town centers), give us locational advantage in terms of access to more concentrated marketplaces and to consumer demographics that are more likely to spend on premium products. Furthermore, we believe that the UK government’s increased focus on ensuring that high streets continue to thrive and receive suitable investments will lead to an increase in footfall at city and town centers, which will also be to our advantage. The UK pub market has historically been overcrowded. Over the last four decades, a number of unprofitable and smaller leased and tenanted pubs have exited the market. This has led to a long-term decline in the number of pubs and bars in the United Kingdom, with the total UK pub market size contracting from approximately 63,500 pubs in 1990 to approximately 47,600 pubs in 2018, and this trend may continue. While the long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK pub market may be difficult to predict, in the short and medium term it may lead to a number of changes in industry trends and practices. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on sales volumes in pubs located in town or city centers as compared to our pubs located in suburbs. In addition, high streets may offer more real estate opportunities for pubs and bars due to the reduction in retail space and there may be increased demand for stable freehold assets. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our offering within the UK pub market because of our ability to offer the best format for each specific target market and to exist in multiple sites across city, town centers and suburban sites without adversely affecting sales at our pubs in adjacent locations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.6,Highly experienced and stable senior management team with strong sponsor backing,"The combined group will have a highly experienced and stable senior management team, with an average of over 25 years of relevant experience, combining complementary skill sets in the retail, leisure and service sectors. The combined group is led by our CEO, Simon Longbottom, who has more than 25 years of experience in the leisure industry. Prior to joining us, Mr. Longbottom was a Managing Director of Pub Partners, the tenanted division of Greene King plc, as well as a Managing Director of Gala Coral’s gaming division. He has also held senior positions with Mill House Inns and Mitchell’s & Butlers plc. The combined group will also benefit from the strong experience of our Chairman, Ian Payne, MBE, who has more than 40 years of industry experience and helped found Stonegate Group in 2010. Mr. Payne, an accomplished expert in the licensed leisure sector, has held board positions with Bass Taverns, Stakis plc and Ladbrokes gaming. He was CEO of the Laurel Pub Company (which included a large leased and tenanted portfolio), from its inception in May 2001 through to December 2004, and was involved in the sale of Laurel Pub Company to Ei Group. He later became Chairman of Bay Restaurant Group and Town and City Pub Group. In November 2019, he was recognized for his contribution to the sector and received the CGA Peach Industry Icon award. With the leadership of our strong senior management team, we have grown our revenues from £697 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to £853 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 representing an increase of 22.2%. The combined group continues to have strong sponsor backing from TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm, which managed funds of over €10 billion of committed capital as of the end of 2019. On July 17, 2020, TDR Capital contributed equity of £50 million to support our business in light of the challenges presented due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.1,Business as usual,"- **Ei Group Publican Partnerships: We plan to continue to operate the publican partnerships business acquired from Ei Group, which represented the core segment of Ei Group’s business, in its existing form. Ei Group shaped a stronger and more profitable publican partnership business by strategically disposing of underperforming, smaller and secondary assets over time, having halved the size of its publican partnerships estate in the last ten years (from 6,820 pubs in 2010 to 3,424 pubs in 2019). The Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth was 1.2%, 1.2% and 2.3% in the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We intend to continue to invest in the publican partnership portfolio to ensure that our publicans have the infrastructure that they require to provide the best customer experience and to increase site profitability. - **Stonegate Group Managed Pubs: Our strategy for Stonegate Group’s managed pubs business has consistently yielded positive results and we intend to continue to pursue them to the extent that we can in light of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our existing strategy includes continued capital investments, responsiveness to industry trends, pricing improvements, labor efficiency and the implementation of operational best practices across the Stonegate Group estate. We have discussed them in more detail below. The success of our existing strategy is reflected in Stonegate Group’s growth over time. Stonegate Group’s revenue has increased from £558 million in 2014 to £853 million in 2019, representing an increase of 52.9% during this period. _Continue capital investments_ We intend to maintain our commitment to capital investment to continue to improve business performance and to further increase market share. As of April 12, 2020, we had 124 Stonegate Group pubs in which we have not invested while under TDR Capital’s ownership, and we believe that this pipeline, taken together with the sizeable pipeline created by the Transaction, provides strong investment and growth opportunities in the future. We also intend to continue to make second-round capital investments where we see opportunities to create additional value. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity, we currently intend to keep our discretionary spending to a minimum. As a result, until our cash reserves recover to desirable levels, our ability to make capital investment may temporarily be limited. However, we plan to continue making opportunistic capital investment through a careful and considered approach. _Continue to concentrate on our core operating initiatives_ We intend to deliver sustainable profit growth through our core operational initiatives: - _Transition to Premium: Customer demand for premium drink categories has been growing, particularly demand for premium lager and craft beer. In response to this trend, we have consistently increased our offering of premium, higher-value products (including cocktails) to take advantage of increasing demand for premium categories of drinks products. For the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, our revenue mix from premium drinks increased 0.5%, 3.1%, and 0.6% in revenue mix from premium lager, premium spirits and cocktails, respectively, compared to the revenue from these products for the 52 weeks ended January 20, 2019. Our mix of formats and our experience running Be At One, a group of premium specialist cocktail bars that we acquired in 2018, we believe positions us well to continue to benefit from this trend. - _All-Day Formats: Consumers are increasingly considering food offerings at pubs when deciding where to drink. In response to this trend, we have been developing and improving our food offering to increase footfall and drink sales across our pubs. This has also helped us to generate revenue during periods in the day when drink sales are relatively lower. For example, food accounted for 33% of pre-5:00 p.m. sales across our pubs for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. - _Creating Experiences: We deliver memorable customer experiences. We organize a variety of events centered around music and sports to attract and retain our customers. 7 ----- - _Digitalization and Technology: To promote brand awareness and customer retention across our core customer age group of 18 to 35 year olds, we have increased our focus on digital marketing. Our brands (including Be At One) currently have over 3 million Facebook followers in aggregate. We have also developed an app, “We Love Sport”, which allows customers to place orders while seated at their tables and to discover where select sport events are being screened. Be At One also recently joined the Uber Eats platform, where customers in the vicinity of select bars can get their cocktails delivered to their homes. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are implementing a number of technologyfocused measures at our pubs, including the use of online menus and online booking and payment applications, as well as encouraging contactless payments. We believe that these technology innovations could help drive utilization in our pubs during peak hours and improve our gross margin. _Continue to focus on improving margins_ - _Pricing Improvements: Our pricing strategy focuses on promoting premium products, ensuring that price increments between products are in line with the quality of those products and that each step-up is evenly distributed. We also focus on price rationalization, to ensure that prices are consistent within sites across the same format, and the centralized approval of all promotions, which is aimed at rationalization of discounts. - _Labor Efficiency: Our labor strategy focuses on making staffing practices more efficient, with a view to tailoring our staffing requirements based on consumer demand and customer traffic at various times during the day and year. The proactive management of our staffing requirements have been helpful in partially mitigating the impact of National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage. - _Adoption of Best Practices: Our acquisitions have given us an opportunity to gain insight into a variety of best practices of our peers. For example, following the First Novus Acquisitions, we brought on board the target’s events team that specialized in developing and implementing pre-booking and group event strategies. We believe that this expertise helped us improve our sales margins through the increase in pre-bookings and group events across our estate. We plan to continue to learn from and, where useful, adopt, the best practices of our peers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.2,Format conversions supported by investment,"We intend to utilize Stonegate Group’s ability to deliver market-leading operating performance across Ei Group’s managed estate and publican partnerships estate. We also intend to utilize the value creation opportunities provided by the operating model of Ei Group’s Craft Union pubs. These strategies are discussed in more detail below. However, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to fully implement these strategies may temporarily be limited. _Conversions from publican partnerships to managed pubs_ Consistent with the strategy pursued by Ei Group in the past, we expect to continue to convert a number of publican partnership pubs that we have acquired from Ei Group into managed pubs. Ei Group’s publican partnership estate provides a large pipeline for these conversions, with an estimated 82% of its publican partnerships estate, becoming available for conversion within the next five years. We have carried out site visits of the entire Ei Group publican partnerships estate to assess the potential for site conversions, and estimate that approximately 28% of the sites visited are suitable for conversion into managed pubs at profitable levels. We expect these conversions to result in higher profitability. Above a minimum level of sales, managed pubs typically generate incremental profit on a unit basis when compared to a publican partnership pub by retaining the earnings that would otherwise have been retained by publicans in a publican partnership model. Additionally, through our capital investments program, whereby we estimate we will invest, on average, approximately £350,000 to £400,000 per pub to implement these conversions, we would expect to achieve an estimated return on investment of approximately 35% to 50%. _Expand the Craft Union operating model_ Craft Union is one of the divisions that Ei Group operated within its managed pubs segment. These pubs are run by self-employed operators who receive a fixed percentage of the revenue generated at these pubs and are responsible for organizing and paying staff. Its operating model provides the benefits of a managed 8 ----- pub model, in terms of control over investments, formats and operations (e.g., in areas of pricing and marketing), while also providing certain benefits of the publican partnership model, in terms of allocating responsibility to the pub operator for labor, staffing and other costs. These pubs tend to be drink-led with no food offering and have a sports focus. We believe that the Craft Union format is particularly well suited for drink-led pubs with lower revenues. We believe we can create value by improving the existing Craft Union pubs and also by converting existing publican partnership pubs into the Craft Union format. These conversions should be simple to execute and we should be able to achieve scale with speed. We estimate that we will invest, on average, approximately £125,000 per pub to convert publican partnership pubs into Craft Union pubs, which gives us the opportunity to increase profitability at lower levels of capital investment.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.3,Cost reduction by realizing synergies,"We believe that there are significant opportunities for cost savings through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group, and by gaining increased scale through the combined operations. Based on our current estimates, we believe we will be able to achieve approximately £80 million in cost savings resulting from streamlined procurement costs, optimized site operations and expected head office synergies. These cost savings have been estimated relative to costs incurred by Stonegate Group and Ei Group on a combined basis for the financial year 2019. We estimate that we will realize approximately £32 million of these cost savings, which represents approximately 40% of our total expected cost savings, by December 2020. We expect to realize the remaining cost savings by December 2021. _Procurement: Stonegate Group and Ei Group are predominantly drink-led businesses procuring_ comparable products. As a result of the Transaction, our estate has grown from 760 sites as of January 19, 2020 to 4,749 sites on a combined basis as of April 12, 2020, presenting a significant opportunity for us to utilize the scale of the combined business and renegotiate suppliers’ terms to reduce our procurement costs. Ei Group’s drinks requirement is more heavily weighted toward beer and cider, with a greater purchase volume in these categories compared to Stonegate Group. For this reason, Ei Group benefits from better pricing terms for beer and cider. We believe that by migrating the rest of the group to Ei Group’s pricing structure, we can achieve significant cost savings. Moreover, we believe that transitioning to supply contracts that bundle BCF (i.e., beer, cider and flavored alcoholic beverages) or WSM (i.e., wines, spirits and minerals) or food, we will be able to achieve better pricing terms overall in light of the size of the combined group. Based on our current estimates, we expect to achieve aggregate procurement savings of approximately £43 million. We estimate that we will realize approximately £11 million of these savings by December 2020, and the remaining £32 million by December 2021. _Head office and site operation synergies: We are in the process of carrying out a detailed review to_ implement the integration of Stonegate Group and Ei Group. Based on the outcome of this review, there may be a controlled reduction in the combined group’s headcount. This would include rationalizing certain corporate and support functions at Ei Group’s head office where there is duplication with our existing functions or where the function was required to support Ei Group’s status as a publicly listed company. The chairman of its board of directors, the non-executive directors, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer resigned effective March 3, 2020. Based on our management’s initial assessment, which is subject to a more detailed review that we expect to complete within six months from the Transaction, the aggregate cost savings from these resignations and the elimination of remuneration payable to senior management and certain other head office employees, will be approximately £7 million. Based on our current estimates, we expect to achieve approximately £37 million of cost savings relating to head office and site operation synergies. We estimate that we will realize approximately £22 million of these savings by December 2020, and the remaining £15 million by December 2021. We also plan to drive cost savings at the site level by implementing various operational best practices and achieving greater efficiency across the combined group. For example, Stonegate Group’s repairs and maintenance system, ProNett, will be implemented across the combined group, enabling better cost management in this category and generally a better approach to managing expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

In addition to the format conversions discussed above, we will assess each site in the portfolio for its value within the combined 9 ----- group against its alternative value. This will involve assessing sites for their value in alternative commercial or residential use and as a pub in the ownership of another group. Realizing such value in our portfolio will enable the group to redeploy disposal proceeds into the estate and help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity position and our ability to invest in the short term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,The Transaction,9.4.1,,"On March 3, 2020, Bidco completed the Transaction by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. The Transaction valued Ei’s entire issued ordinary share capital at £1,265 million. The terms of the Transaction implied an enterprise value of approximately £3,010 million and a multiple of approximately 11.4 times the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) of £263 million for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 (adjusted for 355 commercial properties and 124 assets in the ordinary course disposed of by Ei Group during the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019). Following the Transaction, Ei’s shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange and Ei has been re-registered as a private limited company. As a condition to approval by the UK Competition and Market Authority (the “CMA”) of the Transaction, we have undertaken to dispose of 42 sites to third parties, which include 10 sites from the Stonegate Group estate and 32 sites from the Ei Group estate. For the financial year 2019, these sites represented an aggregate pre-adjusted site EBITDA of approximately £4 million. We intend to complete the disposal of these sites by November 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Recent Developments,9.5.1,Current Trading,"Our results for the quarter ended July 5, 2020 will be heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our managed pubs were shut for this period and generated no revenue. Our publican partnership and commercial properties segments generated some rental income for this quarter but the majority of our income is volume-driven and will be heavily impacted by the closure of our tenants’ pubs and businesses. Offsetting this, we were able to minimize our operating costs at a site and central level, particularly supported by the government’s furlough scheme, described below. More detail on the measures taken to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 are set out below. _Publican partnership estate_ As of July 19, 2020, we believe that approximately 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate had been reopened by our publicans, estimated based on supply orders received. At this early stage, we have limited information to gauge the performance of these pubs and rely on supply orders and limited consumption data to gauge the early trading performance of this estate. Metred data for the sales of barrelled beer, cider and ale for a sample averaging a daily total of 1,053 pubs for the week of July 6, 2020 to July 12, 2020 shows that volumes for this period of trading were at 87% of the volumes for the same group of pubs and for the same period in 2019. Metred data for the sales of barrelled beer, cider and ale for a sample averaging a daily total of 1,130 pubs for the week of July 13, 2020 to July 19, 2020 shows that volumes for this period of trading were at 91% of the volumes for the same group of pubs and for the same period in 2019. We believe this positive early performance is reflective of the quality of the estate and the level of support provided to our publicans by both the UK government and our own publican support measures. We have seen only a minimal increase in vacant properties where publicans have resigned their tenancy. As of July 19, 2020, only 85 sites within our publican partnership estate were closed and without a tenancy agreement. Our publican partnership estate benefits from external drinking areas and we estimate that approximately 90% of our publican partnership estate has the use of such areas. _Managed pub estate_ On July 4, 2020, we had reopened 886 of our managed pubs. As of July 12, 2020, we had reopened 931 of our managed pubs and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 985 of our managed pubs (representing approximately 77% of our managed pub estate). Of the approximately 291 managed pubs which remain closed as of July 19, 2020, approximately half are late night venues focused on dancing, which we do not think can be responsibly opened in a profitable manner at this early stage. Our remaining closed managed 10 ----- pubs comprise student-focused pubs, sites in areas of high concentration, small sites without practical external drinking areas, certain sites in largely-empty business districts and a handful of pubs where refurbishments are to be completed. A significant proportion of our managed pub estate benefits from external drinking areas and we estimate that approximately 69% of our managed pub estate (excluding managed investment pubs) has the use of such areas. We have presented below certain sales information for our managed pubs (excluding our managed investment pubs) that were open and in operation for the week ending July 12, 2020 and the equivalent week in 2019 (a sample of 776 pubs as of July 6, 2020, increasing to 794 managed pubs as of July 12, 2020) and for the week ending July 19, 2020 and the equivalent week in 2019 (a sample of 811 pubs as of July 13, 2020, increasing to 845 managed pubs as of July 19, 2020): - our total revenue from these pubs was 60% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 12, 2020 and 64% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 19, 2020 (in each case, based on the total revenue for the same group of pubs and for the same period in 2019); - our drink revenue from these pubs was 62% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 12, 2020 and 65% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 19, 2020 (in each case, based on the drink revenue for the same group of pubs and for the same period in 2019); - our food revenue from these pubs was 53% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 12, 2020 and 64% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 19, 2020 (in each case, based on the food revenue for the same group of pubs and for the same period in 2019); and - our gross profit from these pubs was 61% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 12, 2020 and 65% of the comparable prior year period for the week ending July 19, 2020 (in each case, based on the gross profit for the same group of pubs and for the same period in 2019).

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Recent Developments,9.5.2,Impact of COVID-19,"The global outbreak of COVID-19 has had a significant effect on our industry and our business. It resulted in the UK government taking unprecedented steps to implement a national lockdown, restricting social gatherings and mandating closure of non-essential businesses, in each case, leading to business slowdowns and shutdowns. The spread of COVID-19 has had a material negative impact on our business, resulting in the temporary closure of substantially all of our sites for the period between March 20, 2020, when the UK government ordered the closure of all pubs and restaurants with immediate effect, to July 4, 2020. Our pubs reopened for business on July 4, 2020 and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 77% of our managed pubs and we believe that our publicans had reopened an estimated 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate. At the foundation of the business decisions we made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was the health, safety, and well-being of our customers, employees and other stakeholders. As such, we have closely followed government advice at each stage. Discussed below are the immediate impact of COVID-19 on our business and the various measures we have taken to protect and manage our business, reduce our cost base and protect our liquidity. _Impact on Operations_ Set out below are the key measures we took in the wake of the UK government mandated closure of our pubs in response to COVID-19: - closed all pubs in our estate effective March 20, 2020 as part of the UK government’s efforts to restrict social contact. All of our assets and premises were successfully secured after receiving the closure order, including all current stock and cash; - furloughed 96% of our staff, consistent with the approach taken by our industry peers and in compliance with government guidelines such as the Job Retention Scheme (defined below); 11 ----- - moved the central office team to a work-from-home model where staff continued to support the business where required; and - paused our investment program across the board and also the conversion of sites acquired as part of the Transaction. _Certain Trading Data_ Following a strong performance in the first quarter of 2020, trading during the start of the second quarter of 2020 remained robust and generally in line with expectations for Stonegate Group and Ei Group. Our second quarter performance was impacted by two extraordinary events – storms Ciara and Dennis, the impact of which we experienced in the weeks commencing February 10, 2020 and February 17, 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which we started experiencing from the week commencing March 9, 2020, with a decline in footfall at our pubs, and which culminated in government-mandated closure of our pubs from March 20, 2020.

On or about March 16, 2020, we fully drew our Revolving Facilities as a precautionary measure to increase liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of the current uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective July 13, 2020, the committed financing available under our Revolving Facilities Agreement was increased by £50 million and is available for 23 months from that date. On July 17, 2020, TDR Capital contributed equity of £50 million to support our business in light of the challenges presented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to retain this amount as cash on our balance sheet and to utilize it to finance our business and operational needs as required. We estimate additional cash inflows of approximately £41 million in aggregate over the period to March 2021 as a result of proceeds we expect to receive from the disposal of the 42 sites agreed with the CMA in connection with the Transaction and the new schemes announced by the UK government including the award of £1,000 of bonus for every furloughed employee we bring back to work and the net benefit of the reduction in VAT from 20% to 5% on food and non-alcoholic drinks. This estimate is based on our current trading expectations and assumes no change in trading outlook and, in particular, no local, regional or national lockdown or other enforced closure of our estate in whole or in part and no changes to government policies that would have an adverse impact on our current cash flow expectations. _Liquidity profile between March 2020 and reopening of our pubs_ Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 30, 2020 was £229.3 million and our cash and cash equivalents as of July 3, 2020 was £96.1 million, in each case, excluding cash at the Unique Group (which was £86.5 million as of July 3, 2020).

However, it already has, and may continue to have, a material effect on our financial results. Management has concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a triggering event in the second quarter of 2020, which resulted in management performing an impairment evaluation of our assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating leases. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

(1.1)% (2.0)% (1) Reflects Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth for the ten weeks ended March 7, 2020, representing Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth for the portion of our second quarter of 2020 not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. _Government Assistance_ In response to COVID-19, HM Treasury in the United Kingdom announced a package of temporary measures to support public services, people and businesses through the period of disruption. These measures included the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (the “Job Retention Scheme”), deferred VAT payments, business rate payment holidays and the Retail Hospitality and Leisure Grant Scheme (the “Hospitality Scheme”). We have utilized the following government assistance programs so far: For our managed pubs, - the Job Retention Scheme, which provided payroll support for our furloughed employees (80% of salary or wages, up to £2,500 per month) and resulted in approximately £3.1 million of support per week for the period from March 23, 2020 to June 30, 2020; - VAT deferral scheme, whereby the VAT payable for the period of our pub closures has been deferred until March 2021; and - the business rates holiday scheme for the 2020 to 2021 tax year, whereby we are exempt from paying business rates for 2020 to 2021 tax year, which we estimate will result in a benefit of approximately £50 million. 12 ----- For our publican partnership pubs, - assistance to approximately 3,500 of our publicans by way of a £188 million support package, estimated as of June 2020, consisting of assistance provided under the Hospitality Scheme, covering cash grants for properties within rateable value bands, the Job Retention Scheme, covering payroll support for furloughed employees (80% of salary or wages, up to £2,500 per month), business rates relief, covering business rates holiday scheme for the 2020 to 2021 tax year, self-employed grants, covering grants worth 80% of average monthly trading profits for three months payable to self-employed individuals, and the employment and the support allowance scheme, covering grants payable to individuals under the state pension age and having a disability or adverse health conditions. _Our assistance to publicans_ We have extended an overall support package to our publicans in a total amount of £29 million, estimated as of June 2020. For the months of April, May and June 2020, we provided all our tied publicans operating on substantive agreements that were not in receipt of government grants a three-month rent credit. During this period, we provided trade credits of either 75% or 50% of the value of three months’ rent as further support to those of our publicans who were entitled to government grants of between £10,000 and £25,000. In addition, during this period, we cancelled tie release fees and fixtures and fittings rentals regardless of a publican’s entitlement to government grants. For the month of July 2020, we have provided all our tied publicans operating on substantive agreements concessions of 75% on rent, tie release fees and fixtures and fittings. For the month of August 2020, we have provided concessions of 50% on rent, tie release fees and fixtures and fittings. We intend to continue to evaluate support to our publicans to enable them to restart their business with confidence and ease cash flow. _Cost Control Measures_ In response to the closure of our pubs on March 20, 2020, we adopted swift measures to significantly reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of maximizing our liquidity position. Specifically, we adopted the following measures: - put on hold all non-essential and discretionary spend within the business, including any growth, expansionary or investment capital expenditures; - made furlough arrangements and agreed salary cuts, which resulted in a reduction in our average wage bill of £5.1 million per week to £300,000 per week for the period from March 23, 2020 to June 30, 2020; - retained only a small number of staff/contractors to perform emergency works on the buildings when required; and - entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent payments during the period of closure, which we expect will result in a deferral of £45 million of rent payables until the end of the calendar year; in addition, we have deferred approximately £19 million of rent receivables (excluding receivables within the Unique Group) from our tenants. These measures resulted in reduced operating costs of approximately £5.5 million per month for the period April 2020 to June 2020, consisting primarily of adjusted payroll costs (net of furlough grants), cost of utilities, caretaker fee paid to the operators of our Craft Union pubs, other essential overhead costs (e.g., pest control costs, rent payments for equipment and costs in relation to maintaining regulatory licenses) and certain costs relating to maintaining our IT systems. To manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity going forward, we may consider using certain strategic options available to us, including: - reduction in discretionary spend through careful and considered approach to discretionary capital expenditure programs until cash reserves recover to desirable levels; - access other government assistance programs such as the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) if required; and 13 ----- - consider asset dispositions in addition to the CMA mandated asset dispositions in connection with the Transaction. _Reopening_ We have reopened our pubs in accordance with the guidelines issued by the UK government. These guidelines include measures in relation to increased sanitation and hygiene requirements, limitations on the size of gatherings, keeping a temporary record of customers, social distancing and other mitigating measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. In compliance with these guidelines and to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our customers, employees and other stakeholders, we have implemented a number of measures in relation to the reopening of our pubs, including: - conducting training of our employees to ensure that our pubs are operated in compliance with applicable guidelines; - making available personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and cleaning supplies at our managed pubs, and coordinating with suppliers to ensure steady supply; - installing adequate signage, screens and barriers at our managed pubs and implementing measures to provide guidance to customers on social distancing and hygiene requirements; - implementing technology systems at our managed pubs to limit contact, including using online menus (in addition to disposable menus), online booking and payment applications, encouraging contactless payments and using online applications to record customer information; and - assisting our publicans in the training of staff and in the implementation of health and safety policies, and providing them with a PPE package to assist in commencing operations. _Reopening Costs_ We estimate that we have used approximately £15 million in initial working capital for reopening our estate effective July 4, 2020. This includes: - approximately £10 million of inventory bills from March 2020 paid before getting back to normal payment terms (mostly 60 days); - approximately £2.5 million of cash provided to pubs needed to run the business (e.g., cash needed at tills); and - approximately £2.5 million of opening maintenance capital expenditure to cover costs of signage, protector screens and other equipment. _Working capital estimates upon reopening_ Management estimate non-financial accruals of up to approximately £176 million as of June 30, 2020: - approximately £45 million of rent accrued through the period of closure; - approximately £43 million of deferred tax, payroll and VAT, which we expect to be repaid over an extended period; - approximately £52 million of fees associated with the Transaction, which were deferred to support our liquidity position; and - approximately £36 million of payables such as accrued supplier payments, which we expect will be materially complete by the end of August 2020. Management also estimate cash inflow from working capital of approximately £96 million as we reopen our business. This is driven by our revenue being received essentially immediately, while we pay our suppliers on extended terms, typically 60 days, and pay for our maintenance capital expenditures well into the project, also typically 60 days. For the period March to July 2020, during which the estate was closed, we paid off a significant proportion of our creditor payables in working capital. As we reopen the estate, our payables balance will recover, creating a cash inflow, receivable over approximately the first quarter after reopening and as we recover to normal volumes based on current assumptions. The exact timing and amount of this cash receivable is uncertain and will depend on trading volumes, supplier behaviour and any local, regional or national lockdown or other enforced closure of our estate in whole or in part. 14 ----- As we begin to bring our business back on track after this period of closure, we are looking to our competitive advantages to recover from the impact of COVID-19, principal among which are: - our format diversity, which offers us the ability to generate sales from various avenues; - our scale and market position; - the geographic diversity of our estate, which allows us to benefit from the best performing areas; - ability to convert high-volume sites to the most suitable formats for accelerated growth; and - ability to increase market share and improve market positioning. The impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing and ability of vaccination and other treatments to combat COVID-19, the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending, the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return to pre-COVID-19 levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.36,Stonegate Group’s Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other Information,9.36.1,,"The following tables summarize Stonegate Group’s historical and pro forma financial information as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The summary historical consolidated financial information as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, have been derived from Stonegate Group’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The summary historical condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 and January 19, 2020 and the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 and April 12, 2020, have been derived from Stonegate Group’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Stonegate Group’s financial year accounting periods run from the calendar day following the previous financial year end, which, for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 were September 26, 2016, September 25, 2017 and October 1, 2018, respectively, to the Sunday nearest to our accounting reference date. Accordingly, from time to time, Stonegate Group’s financial year accounting period covers a 53-week period instead of a 52-week period. For instance, Stonegate Group’s financial year accounting period for 2018 was 53 weeks, whereas for 2017 and 2019, it was 52 weeks. Consequently, the results for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 were positively impacted by an additional week’s trading relative to the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 and the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, which impacts the comparability of results over these periods. Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information includes the financial information of Ei Group from and including March 3, 2020, the date on which the Transaction was completed. For the financial periods preceding March 3, 2020, Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information does not include the financial information of Ei Group, which are discussed elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Ei Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” Accordingly, Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 may not be comparable to Stonegate Group’s historical consolidated financial information as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019. IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year commencing on or after that date. Stonegate Group’s first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS 16 began September 30, 2019. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 for financial periods beginning September 30, 2019. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information for previous years is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to our financial statement for the periods prior to the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. However, certain financial information as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 is presented in this Offering Memorandum on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, to provide a meaningful basis for comparing our financial statements with prior periods. See “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Policy.” We have also presented below certain income statement information, as well as the other financial and operating information, for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, which has been derived by adding the relevant item for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 and for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), and subtracting the relevant item for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 20, 2020, the UK government directed the closure of all pubs and bars in the United Kingdom. Pursuant to this directive, our pubs closed for business on March 20, 2020. Our pubs reopened for business on July 4, 2020 and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 77% of our managed pubs and we believe that our publicans had reopened an estimated 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate. Accordingly, between March 20, 2020 and April 12, 2020, we did not conduct any significant trading activity. For that reason, the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 was our last full trading quarter that was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, we believe, the financial information as of and for the 16 weeks and the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 more accurately represent our operating and financial performance in a steady state of business than the financial information as of 27 ----- and for the 28 weeks and the 52 weeks ended April 12, 2020. Accordingly, we have presented below certain historical financial and operating information for the 16 weeks and 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. We also present below certain information relating to our operating, non-IFRS measures for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 on a 52-week basis to enhance comparability with prior periods as noted in the individual footnotes. In addition, we present certain non-IFRS measures below that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance. For Stonegate Group, non-IFRS measures include, among others, Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA, Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA, Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDAR, Stonegate Group Cash Conversion, Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Revenue Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing), Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing), Stonegate Group Total Gross Margin (Ongoing) and Stonegate Group Return on Investment. For the combined group, pro forma and other non-IFRS measures include, among others, Combined Group Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies Margin (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAR Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), Adjusted Net Debt, Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt, Adjusted Cash Interest Expense and various leverage coverage and loan to value ratios. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. Adjusted Net Debt, Adjusted Cash Interest Expense, Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt and Unique Group Adjusted Net Debt presented below provide information on an “adjusted” basis to give effect to the Transaction Financing and £50 million of equity contribution by TDR Capital in July 2020, and the application of the proceeds therefrom. The unaudited adjusted financial information presented below does not purport to represent what Stonegate Group’s actual net debt and lease adjusted net debt would have been had the Transaction occurred on January 19, 2020, or what Stonegate Group’s actual cash interest expense would have been had the Transaction occurred on January 21, 2019, nor does it purport to represent these metrics as of or for any future date or for any future period. The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Information” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The adjustments to our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) to derive our resulting Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) should be treated with caution when making an investment decision.” 28 ----- The results of operations and other financial and operating information for prior years are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. This financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and discussed in “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Stonegate Group’s Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information,” “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

In connection with the Transaction, we believe that there are potential opportunities for cost savings through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group, and by gaining increased scale through combined operations. Our estimated costs savings reflect estimated procurement savings, savings resulting from optimizing site operations and savings from extracting possible head office synergies. We estimate that we will realize approximately £32 million of these cost savings, which represents approximately 40% of our total expected cost savings, by December 2020. We expect to realize the remaining cost savings by December 2021. We expect to derive a total procurement savings of approximately £43 million primarily by migrating to Ei Group’s more favorable pricing structures in relation to certain drink supply contracts and by utilizing the scale of the combined operations to renegotiate drinks and food suppliers’ pricing terms. Based on our current estimates, we expect to achieve approximately £11 million of these procurement savings by December 2020, and the remaining £32 million by December 2021. We expect to derive further savings from optimizing site operations by, among other things, (i) converting a number of Stonegate Group pubs from their fully-managed format to Ei Group’s Craft Union division of operator-managed pubs, (ii) applying Stonegate Group’s best practices across Ei Group’s Bermondsey pub formats with a view to reducing operating costs at those sites, (iii) migrating to Ei Group’s more favorable pricing structures in relation to certain media contracts and (iv) reducing repair and maintenance costs across Ei Group’s estate by implementing Stonegate Group’s tried and tested cost control measures. Based on our management’s initial assessment, which is subject to a more detailed review that we expect to complete within six months from the Transaction, we expect to realize head office synergies by, among other things, (i) eliminating costs related to public company operations, (ii) reducing overall head office property costs, IT integration of certain back office functions and potentially reducing the combined group’s headcount where there is duplication of roles or where the function was required to support Ei’s status as a public listed company and (iii) removing the board of directors and senior management of Ei Group, including the chairman of the board of directors, the non-executive directors, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, and eliminating the remuneration payable to them and certain other senior management and head office employees who may not continue their employment in the combined group, which we believe will result in aggregate estimated costs saving of approximately £7 million. Based on our current estimates, we expect to achieve approximately £37 million of cost savings relating to head office and site operation synergies. We estimate that we will realize approximately £22 million of these savings by December 2020, and the remaining £15 million by December 2021. We estimate that we will incur one-off aggregate costs of approximately £25 million by December 2021 to realize these cost savings. Any cost savings that we believe we can realize in relation to the Transaction are based on our past experience and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the period presented and may not be comparable to our historical consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our management may not be able to successfully implement our strategic and financial objectives.” (b) Represent the aggregate cost savings that we had not realized during the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 in connection with the Fever Bars Acquisition and the Be At One Acquisition, consisting of incremental cost savings relating to the application of the prices that we are currently offered by our drinks suppliers to the drinks supply purchases of Be At One and Fever Bars. Any run rate adjustments and aggregate cost savings that we believe we can make in relation to the Be At One Acquisition and Fever Bars Acquisition are based on our past experience in similar circumstances and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. They involve, among other things, conforming certain performance measures to our historical performance and may be affected by seasonality or unusual effects. These effects may not recur in future 40 ----- months to the same degree or at all. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the transaction for the period presented and may not be comparable to our historical consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. (c) Represents adjustments made to give 52-week effect to the incremental site EBITDA generated post-investment at certain of our pubs in which we have invested during the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, as if such investments had occurred on January 20, 2019. This adjustment does not reflect the actual site EBITDA that a pub would have generated during the period that it was closed down for renovation or refurbishment. All capital expenditure and related expenses pertaining to these investments have been recognized in the period presented. (d) Represents our estimate of the aggregate site EBITDA that would have been generated at our pubs that were closed down for renovation or refurbishment during the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. For each pub that was closed down during the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, we have estimated its site EBITDA for the period of such closure based on site EBITDA that it generated during the comparable period in the previous year. (e) Represents our estimate of the net impact of the aggregate incremental costs associated with the increases in the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage. For this calculation, we have applied the National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage rates that came into effect on April 1, 2019 for the period between January 20, 2020 to April 1, 2020 and the National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage rates that has come into effect on April 1, 2020 for the period between April 1, 2020 to January 17, 2021, in each case, assuming that we had the same number of employees as for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. (f) Includes the pre-adjusted site EBITDA of 42 sites, which we have undertaken to dispose of to third parties to satisfy the concerns of the CMA in connection with the Transaction. For the financial year 2019, these sites had an aggregate pre-adjusted site EBITDA of approximately £4 million. See “—Transaction.” This Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) has not been prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, and does not purport to represent what our results of operations would have been, nor do they purport to project the results of operations for any future period. For the purposes of the unaudited Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) included herein and giving effect to the Transaction, we have made various assumptions. The adjustments and assumptions we have made are preliminary and subject to change. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The adjustments to our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) to derive our resulting Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) should be treated with caution when making an investment decision.” (13) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies Margin (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) represents the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) divided by £1,598 million, representing the sum of Stonegate Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 (£874 million) and Ei Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 (£724 million). Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies Margin (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) is a non-IFRS measure that has important limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— Non-IFRS Financial Information” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” (14) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAR Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) before operating lease rental expense for Stonegate Group, Ei Group and certain recent acquisitions or, where applicable, rent payments in relation to them, as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

(b) Represents the operating lease rental expense of Ei Group for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019, excluding the impact of IFRS 16. (15) We define Stonegate Group’s like-for-like metrics presented above, as follows: - Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, Stonegate Group’s aggregate change in revenue from drinks sales compared to the previous comparable period made at all pubs open and operated in either Stonegate Group’s branded or unbranded group throughout the current and previous period; 41 ----- - Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, Stonegate Group’s aggregate change in revenue from food sales compared to the previous comparable period made at all pubs open and operated in either Stonegate Group’s branded or unbranded group throughout the current and previous period; - Stonegate Group Revenue Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, Stonegate Group’s aggregate change in revenue compared to the previous comparable period made at all pubs open and operated in either Stonegate Group’s branded or unbranded group throughout the current and previous period; - Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, the aggregate change in the Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA (less Stonegate Group overhead costs) compared to the previous comparable period made at all pubs open and operated in either Stonegate Group’s branded or unbranded group throughout the current and previous period; and - Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) represents, for the relevant period, Stonegate Group’s change in total gross margin (calculated as Stonegate Group’s total revenue minus total operating costs divided by total revenue) compared to the previous comparable period relating to all pubs open and operated in either Stonegate Group’s branded or unbranded group throughout the current and previous comparable period. For Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Revenue Sales Growth (Like for Like), Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) and Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, we have presented like for like sales, Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA and total gross margin, as applicable, for a 52-week period rather than a 53-week period to enhance comparability. Accordingly, we have calculated like for like sales, Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA and total gross margin as applicable, for this period by taking into account, in each case, the like for like sales, Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA and total gross margin, as applicable, for the first 52 weeks’ to enhance comparability. These metrics for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 are presented under “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Measures—Like for Like Growth.” For more information concerning how these metrics are calculated, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information.” (16) Stonegate Group Revenue Growth (Like for Like) for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 would have been 2.9%, if Stonegate Group’s revenue for the comparable period was adjusted to exclude (i) higher sales due to the Football World Cup during June and July 2018 and (ii) a decline in sales due to severe cold weather conditions experienced across the United Kingdom during parts of February and March 2018. (17) Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) represents, for the relevant period, (i) revenue from drinks sales (excluding revenue from drinks sales at disposed sites) minus cost of the drinks purchased (excluding costs of drinks purchased at disposed sites), divided by (ii) revenue from drinks sales (excluding revenue from drinks sales at disposed sites). Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) represents, for the relevant period, (i) our revenue from food sales (excluding revenue from food sales at disposed sites) minus cost of the food purchased (excluding costs of food purchased at disposed sites), divided by (ii) revenue from food sales (excluding revenue from food sales at disposed sites). Stonegate Group Total Gross Margin (Ongoing) represents, for the relevant period, our total revenue (excluding revenue at disposed sites) minus total operating costs (excluding operating costs at disposed sites), divided by total revenue (excluding revenue at disposed sites). These metrics for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 are presented under “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Measures—Like for Like Growth.” (18) Stonegate Group Return on Investment represents, for all pubs invested during the 156 weeks preceding the date on which we present the Stonegate Group Return on Investment, the difference between the annualized (on a 52-week basis) aggregate weekly average post-investment Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA (from the first full four-week period after the re-opening of such pubs) and the 52-week pre-investment Stonegate Group Pre-adjusted EBITDA of those pubs (to the end of the last full four-week period), divided by the aggregate Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure invested in these pubs over the same 156 weeks. Where a pub has traded for less than 52 weeks post-investment, we have not taken it into account when calculating the Stonegate Group Return on Investment. Pubs where we have not made a Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure in the past 156 weeks are classed as uninvested. For Stonegate Group Return on Investment for the 156 weeks ended April 12, 2020, see “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Measures—Stonegate Group Return on Investment.” For more information concerning how this metric is calculated, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information.” (19) Represents sites closed in the ordinary course of business as of April 12, 2020 (not including COVID-19 mandated government closures). (20) To satisfy the concerns of the CMA in connection with the Transaction, we have undertaken to dispose of 42 sites to third parties, including 10 sites from Stonegate Group’s estate and 32 sites from Ei Group’s estate. For the financial year 2019, these sites had an aggregate pre-adjusted site EBITDA of approximately £4 million. We intend to complete the disposal of these sites by November 2020. (21) Adjusted Net Debt, Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt and Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt are calculated as follows: - Adjusted Net Debt represents Stonegate Group’s net debt as of January 19, 2020 less Stonegate Group’s lease liability as of January 19, 2020 (calculated in accordance with IFRS 16), as adjusted to give effect to the Transaction Financing and £50 million of equity contribution by TDR Capital in July 2020, and the application of the proceeds therefrom. Adjusted Net Debt as of January 19, 2020 is calculated as: (i) the sum of £1,223 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes offered hereby, £500 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Fixed Rate Notes, £26 million of borrowings under our Revolving Facilities Agreement 42 ----- (representing Stonegate Group’s actual revolver borrowings of £6 million as of January 19, 2020 and Ei Group’s actual revolver borrowings of £20 million as of December 28, 2019), £180 million of borrowings under our Senior Term Facilities Agreement, £400 million of borrowings under our Second Lien Facility Agreement and £683 million in aggregate principal amount of Unique Securitized Notes as of December 28, 2019, less (ii) the sum of cash and cash equivalents of Stonegate Group as of January 19, 2020 (£16 million) and Ei Group as of December 28, 2019 (£156 million), adjusted for (iii) (x) £50 million of equity contribution by TDR Capital in July 2020, which we intend to retain as cash on our balance sheet and to utilize to finance our business and operational needs as required, (y) an estimated £3.1 million of accrued and unpaid interest related to the Senior Bridge Facilities and the Senior Term Facilities being repaid, assuming they get repaid on or about July 31, 2020, which we intend to pay from cash on balance sheet on or about the Issue Date and (z) an estimated £12.7 million of fees in connection with the issuance of the Notes, part of which we paid from cash on balance sheet on or about July 13, 2020 in connection with the issuance of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the remainder of which we intend to pay from cash on balance sheet on or about the Issue Date. Assuming drawings of £200 million under our Revolving Facilities Agreement as of January 19, 2020, our Adjusted Net Debt would have been higher by £174 million. We experienced a significant decrease in our cash and cash equivalents as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a description of our current liquidity position and our liquidity profile between March 30, 2020 and July 3, 2020, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Liquidity Update.” - Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt represents the total borrowings under the Notes, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Revolving Facilities, adjusted to give effect to the Transaction Financing and £50 million of equity contribution by TDR Capital in July 2020, and the application of the proceeds therefrom. Secured First Lien Adjusted Net Debt as of January 19, 2020 is calculated as Adjusted Net Debt as of January 19, 2020 excluding total cash of Unique Group of £111 million (resulting in £2,916 million) less £400 million of borrowings under our Second Lien Facility Agreement and £683 million in aggregate principal amount of Unique Securitized Notes as of December 28, 2019. - Unique Group Adjusted Net Debt represents the total debt less cash of the Unique Group, calculated as follows. Total debt of Unique Group represents the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Unique Securitized Notes as of December 28, 2019 of £683 million. Total cash of Unique Group represents cash at UPP as of December 28, 2019 of £110 million and cash at the Unique Issuer as of December 28, 2019 of £1 million. Unique Group Adjusted Net Debt does not include the fair value premium attributed to Unique Securitized Notes in the consolidated balance sheet of Ei Group as of December 29, 2019 of £9 million or deduct capitalized debt issue costs in relation to the Unique Securitized Notes of £6 million. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” (22) Adjusted Cash Interest Expense represents Stonegate Group’s interest expense in cash adjusted to give effect to the Transaction Financing, and the application of the proceeds therefrom. Adjusted Cash Interest Expense has been calculated in respect of £1,223 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes offered hereby, £500 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Fixed Rate Notes, £180 million of borrowings under our Senior Term Facilities Agreement, £26 million of borrowings under our Revolving Facilities Agreement (representing Stonegate Group’s actual revolver borrowings of £6 million as of January 19, 2020 and Ei Group’s actual revolver borrowings of £20 million as of December 28, 2019), £400 million of borrowings under our Second Lien Facility Agreement and £683 million in aggregate principal amount of Unique Securitized Notes as of December 28, 2019. Assuming drawings of £200 million under our Revolving Facilities Agreement as of January 19, 2020, our Adjusted Cash Interest Expense would have been higher. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” (23) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) less Unique represents the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) of £494 million for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 less Unique Group Underlying EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and £3 million of EBITDA attributable to certain disposed sites) of £120 million for the 52 weeks ended March 28, 2020. The Unique Group Underlying EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended March 28, is presented under “Ei Group’s Summary Historical Financial and Other Information.” (24) Combined LTV Ratio is the ratio of Adjusted Net Debt as of January 19, 2020 to the sum of Stonegate Group Property Asset Value and Ei Group Property Asset Value (£4,087 million). Stonegate Group Property Asset Value of £798 million represents the property asset value of 761 sites of Stonegate Group as of September 29, 2019, determined by Davis Coffer Lyons. Ei Group Property Asset Value of £3,289 million represents the sum of property, plant and equipment, investment property, non-current assets held for sale and intangible assets of Ei Group, derived from Ei Group’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2019, which is based on an annual valuation exercise of Ei Group’s estate carried out by Avison Young, Colliers and the internal estates director of Ei Group. To satisfy the concerns of the CMA in connection with the Transaction, we have undertaken to dispose of 10 sites from Stonegate Group’s estate and 32 sites from Ei Group’s estate to third parties, and we have not adjusted the Stonegate Group Property Asset Value and the Ei Group Property Asset Value to reflect these potential disposals. See “Summary—Transaction.” In addition, the Combined LTV Ratio, Stonegate Group Property Asset Value and Ei Group Property Asset Value do not reflect any impairment in the value of our property, plant and equipment and operating leases after September 30, 2019. Based on our evaluation of expected undiscounted future cash flows of property, plant and equipment related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, carried out to determine if the carrying value of these assets is recoverable, we have recorded a total impairment charge of £24 million as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impairment Review.” (25) Unique Group LTV Ratio is the ratio of Unique Group Adjusted Net Debt (as of December 28, 2019) to the Unique Group Property Asset Value (as of September 30, 2019). Unique Group Property Asset Value of £1,547 million represents the Ei 43 ----- Group Property Asset Value in relation to the pubs beneficially owned by Unique Group. Combined LTV Ratio (excluding Unique) is the ratio of Adjusted Net Debt less Unique Group Adjusted Net Debt to the product of Stonegate Group Property Asset Value plus Ei Group Property Asset Value less Unique Group Property Asset Value. (26) Combined LTV Ratio excluding Unique is the ratio of (i) Adjusted Net Debt less Unique Group Adjusted Net Debt (£2,233 million) to (ii) the sum of Stonegate Group Property Asset Value and Ei Group Property Asset Value (£4,087 million) less Unique Group Property Asset Value (£1,547 million). 44 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.79,Ei Group’s Summary Historical Financial and Other Information,9.79.1,,"The following tables summarize Ei Group’s historical consolidated financial information as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The summary historical consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, have been derived from Ei Group’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The summary historical condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019 have been derived from Ei Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, which have been prepared on a basis consistent with Ei Group’s annual audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of the management of Ei Group, such unaudited financial information reflected all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for those periods. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS as adopted by the European Union. IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year commencing on or after that date. Ei Group’s first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS 16 began October 1, 2019. Accordingly, Ei Group has applied IFRS 16 for financial periods beginning October 1, 2019. Ei Group has adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information for previous years is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to its financial statement for the periods prior to the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019. However, certain of its financial information as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 and the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 is presented in this Offering Memorandum on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, to provide a meaningful basis for comparing its financial statements with prior periods. See “Summary—Ei Group’s Summary Historical Financial and Other Information” and “Ei Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Ei Group’s Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Policy.” The income statement information, as well as the other financial and operating information, presented for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 is derived by adding the relevant item for the year ended September 30, 2019 and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), and subtracting the relevant item for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. We present certain non-IFRS measures below that Ei Group uses to evaluate its operating and financial performance, including, among others, Ei Group EBITDA, Ei Group Underlying EBITDA, Ei Group Underlying EBITDA Margin, Ei Group Cash Conversion, Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth, Ei Group Managed Pubs Like for Like Sales Growth, Ei Group Like for Like Commercial Properties Net Income Growth, Ei Group Publican Partnership Pubs Site EBITDA, Ei Group Commercial Properties Site EBITDA, Ei Group Return on Investment, Ei Group Publican Partnerships Return on Investment, Ei Group Managed Operations Return on Investment, Ei Group Managed Investments Return on Investment, Ei Group Property Asset Value, Unique Group EBITDA, Unique Group Underlying EBITDA and Unique Group Property Asset Value. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate Ei Group’s performance. These measures have been prepared for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. In addition, these measures may not be calculated on a basis similar to that used by Stonegate Group and may not be comparable to similar measures presented for Stonegate Group in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Information.” We also present below Unique Group EBITDA and Unique Group Underlying EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2019, the 16 weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019, the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 and the 26 weeks ended March 30, 2019 and March 28, 2020, which have been derived from UPP’s standalone financial statements. Unique Group EBITDA and Unique Group Underlying EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 are derived by adding the relevant item for the year ended September 30, 2019 and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, and subtracting the relevant item for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. The results of operations and other financial and operating information for prior years are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.

This included a £2 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional depreciation charges and a £4 million increase in finance cost due to additional interest expense on lease liabilities, offset by a £5 million decrease in operating cost due to the elimination of Ei Group’s operating lease expense as operating cost. - The impact of IFRS 16 on Ei Group’s consolidated balance sheet data as of December 28, 2019 consisted of: (i) a net increase of £202 million in non-current assets due to an increase of £192 million in property, plant and equipment pursuant to recognition of a right of use asset in relation to operating leases, an increase of £9 million in investment property pursuant to recognition of a right of use asset in relation to operating leases where the asset is categorized as an investment property and an increase of £8 million in financial assets categorized as non-current assets in relation to net investments in a lease where the sublease is categorized as a finance lease, offset by a decrease of £7 million in intangible assets (operating lease premium) pursuant to recognition of operating leases as a right of use asset in the balance sheet; (ii) a net decrease of £3 million in current assets due to a decrease of £4 million of trade and other receivables pursuant to release of prepayments previously recognized with regard to leaseholds rents offset by an increase of £1 million in financial assets in relation to net investments in leases where the sublease is categorized as a finance lease; (iii) an increase of £12 million in non-current assets held for sale due to recognition of a right of use asset in relation to operating leases where the property is categorized as held for sale; (iv) a net decrease of £1 million in current liabilities due to a decrease of £4 million in trade and other payables pursuant to release of rent review accruals previously recognized with regard to leasehold rents and a decrease of £1 million in current provisions on account of release of onerous lease provision previously recognized with regard to leasehold rents offset by an increase of £4 million in financial liabilities pursuant to recognition of lease liabilities as future commitment to pay leasehold rent; and (v) a net increase of £261 million in non-current liabilities due to an increase of £276 million in financial liabilities pursuant to recognition of lease liabilities as future commitment to pay leasehold rent, offset by a decrease of £5 million in provisions on account of release of onerous lease provision previously recognized with regard to leasehold rents and a decrease of £10 million in deferred tax on account of temporary difference created through IFRS 16. 49 ----- - The impact of IFRS 16 on Ei Group’s consolidated cash flows statement for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, consisted of a reclassification of £5 million of cash flow from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities, representing operating lease payments. See “Ei Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Changes in Accounting Policy.” (2) Includes the impact of IFRS 16.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain and its effect on our customers’ ability or desire to access our pubs and bars will continue to adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.","In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries, including the United Kingdom, have taken preventative measures to try to contain its spread. These measures have included mandatory closure of businesses, including pubs and bars, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions, which have severely diminished the level of economic activity around the world and in the United Kingdom, contributed to significant volatility in financial markets and triggered a period of global economic slowdown. In the United Kingdom, according to the Office of National Statistics, UK gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 10.4% in the three months to April 2020 and monthly GDP declined by 20.4% in April 2020 compared to March 2020, representing the biggest monthly decline on record as of June 12, 2020, as government restrictions on movement dramatically reduced economic activity. A continued economic slowdown may result in declines in disposable income, consumer spending as well as consumer confidence, which is likely to have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. On March 20, 2020, the UK government directed the closure of all pubs and bars in the United Kingdom. Pursuant to this directive, our pubs closed for business on March 20, 2020. Our pubs reopened for business on July 4, 2020 and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 77% of our managed pubs and we believe that our publicans had reopened an estimated 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate. During the period from March 20, 2020 to July 4, 2020, we recorded no revenue other than nominal rent revenue. We continue to provide rent concessions and other support to our publicans, which may also result in lower revenues compared to prior periods. As a result of this period of closure and the measures we continue to take to combat the impact of COVID-19, our financial results for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 have been, and our financial results for the 40 weeks ended July 5, 2020 will be, materially impacted. In addition, we would expect this period of closure or, if there are future periods of closure mandated by the UK government, to have a material impact on our financial results for the 52 weeks ended September 27, 2020 and beyond. Late night formats where dancing is a key part of the offer and pubs aimed at the student demographic remain closed during this initial phase of reopening and we cannot predict when our remaining pubs will reopen. The UK government has prescribed detailed guidelines to maintain social distancing and hygiene measures in pubs to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include measures in relation to increased sanitation and hygiene requirements, limitations on the size of gatherings, keeping a temporary record of customers, social distancing and other mitigating measures to slow the further spread of COVID-19, which may impact our ability to carry out our business and operations on a profitable basis or at all. While we believe our operations are currently in compliance with applicable guidance, if customers perceive our implementation of these measures to be inadequate or ineffective, we may experience lower than expected footfall at our pubs or suffer damage to our reputation, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, customers’ ability or desire to visit pubs may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if and when customer footfall and spending at our pubs will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. We also cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our publicans. Weakening of the financial situation of our publicans could severely restrict their ability to pay rent and 53 ----- drinks revenues to us in a timely manner or at all, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects. It may cause prolonged negotiation with our publicans for additional rent concessions, rent deferrals or modifications to lease structures. Any of these factors could have a long-lasting adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, some of which may be significant, and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business on the same terms as we did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing and ability of vaccination and other treatments to combat COVID-19, the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending, the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return to pre-COVID-19 levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section, including those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,There is material uncertainty on our ability to continue as a going concern.,"Stonegate Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 28, 2020, and Ei Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, have been prepared on a going concern basis. The going concern basis contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as such. See note 1.2 of each of Stonegate Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and as of and for the 16 weeks ended January 28, 2020, and note 1 and note 18 of Ei Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019. Stonegate Group’s latest forecasts and projections are for a period until September 2021 and are based on the phased reopening of its estate, which began on the July 4, 2020. The cash flow assumptions include a phased increase in sales over the going concern period with the assumption that all sites will be open by the end of September 2020. As of the date of Stonegate Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, current trading since July 4, 2020 was in line with these forecasts. The forecasts include a delay in all non-committed capital expenditure, reduction in variable costs including staffing and taking advantage of the twelve-month business rates holiday announced for the hospitality sector. In those forecasts, Stonegate Group is able to remain in compliance with the requirements under its debt facilities. Based on these forecasts, Stonegate Group has the ability to continue trading for a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing of the financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, subject to sales improving in line with expectations, sites not being required to close down again and government initiatives assumed in the forecasts remaining intact. As part of its going concern assessment, Stonegate Group’s board also considered a number of severe but plausible downside scenarios. These scenarios include sales forecasts increasing at a slower growth rate than expected or all sites being required to close down once again for a period of two months. These downside scenarios have a significant impact on sales and cash flow and continue to be under review given current market conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the scenario where sales were to increase at a slower rate than has been forecast, as of July 2021, Stonegate Group may be in breach of certain covenants that it is required to comply with under certain of its debt facilities. In the scenario where all sites were required to close down once again for a period of two months, in the absence of additional funding or other mitigating actions, Stonegate Group may be in breach of certain covenants that it is required to comply with under certain of its debt facilities. 54 ----- It is currently very difficult to assess how the COVID-19 situation will evolve. If one or more of our assumptions in making our assessment to report as a going concern are found to be incorrect, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as such, we would have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose a part or all of their investment in the New Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the United Kingdom and the global economy and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of unknown magnitude and duration, which may impact our liquidity and access to capital.","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. We cannot assure you that conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancing. We may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access and cost of financing will depend on, among others, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts, our prospects and our credit ratings. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or make such debt unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. We depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our operating activities, supply capital to finance our operations and growth, make capital expenditure and manage our debt levels. The continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and could adversely affect our ability to make future interest and other payments with respect to our indebtedness and other obligations. While we have taken several steps to preserve capital, increase liquidity and improve efficiency, described under “Summary—Recent Developments—Liquidity Update,” our short-term liquidity needs are still significant, including funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures, including certain payroll and related benefits, fixed costs associated with the operation of our pubs, interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our pubs (to the extent not deferred) and corporate general and administrative expenses. Since we generally are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our pubs decreases, any resulting decline in our revenues, particularly in the event of a future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a greater adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins and profits. Although we currently believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, our estimated cash burn rates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties related to working capital needs as well as the terms of any financing available to us. Accordingly, it is possible that our monthly cash burn rate could be significantly higher than the levels we currently anticipate, which could mean we do not have sufficient liquidity to withstand reduced levels of business operations for an extended period of time. We may undertake additional steps in the short term to improve our liquidity if we determine that doing so would be beneficial to us. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any such steps or their successful implementation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United Kingdom have had and may have a negative effect on our business.,"All of our pubs are located in the United Kingdom and, therefore, their operating results are impacted by general economic conditions in the United Kingdom. In particular, given that consumer spending on eating and drinking out is discretionary in nature, their revenue is affected by general levels of disposable income. Factors such as financial and political crises in the United Kingdom and the eurozone, terrorist attacks or other unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures that may be implemented by the UK government in connection with Brexit, rising interest rates, declining wages, higher unemployment, tax increases and lack of consumer credit could all adversely affect the levels of disposable income, which in 55 ----- turn may lead to customers reducing their attendance and expenditure at pubs. Similarly, frequent changes to the UK government could lead to economic uncertainty and further loss of consumer confidence. Any such factors could in turn adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. The outlook for the UK economy is currently subject to significant uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead the United Kingdom into a prolonged period of economic downturn, recession or depression. The Bank of England predicts negative growth in the United Kingdom for the year 2020 and the UK government has instituted rescue policies intended to mitigate the effects of a recession. The United Kingdom has not yet fallen into recession and a significant risk remains that measures taken by the UK government and the Bank of England may not prevent the UK economy from entering into a recession. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and disposable income and loss of personal wealth could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. As a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, it is difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand due to adverse macroeconomic conditions may also have an adverse impact on the business of publicans and require us to substantially increase the amounts of financial assistance provided to them to enable them, to carry on their operations. Accordingly, a decline in demand due to the emergence of adverse economic conditions affecting the United Kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.5,"Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union may be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and adversely impact current trading and supply arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.","The United Kingdom has withdrawn from the European Union effective January 31, 2020 and has commenced negotiations with the European Union to enter into a new trade agreement and is in a transition period until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the United Kingdom continues to have access to the single EU market and customs union. However, if no trade agreement is reached during the transition period, the United Kingdom may lose access to the EU market and customs union without a suitable alternate arrangement in place, which may impact the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom and the European Union. The terms of the new trade agreement and the nature of the future relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union remain unclear. Due to the size and importance of the UK economy, and the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union at the end of transition period, enhanced by the economic uncertainty and unpredictability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there may continue to be instability in the market, significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adverse effects on trading agreements or similar cross border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. In addition, Brexit may lead to a down-turn in the United Kingdom or other European economies and could lead to lower levels of consumer spending if consumer confidence declines or if individuals have less disposable income. Any reduction in our customers’ willingness or ability to spend due to Brexit-related changes in the economic environment of the United Kingdom and Europe could materially affect our revenue. A general slow-down in the UK economy due to Brexit may also negatively impact our growth strategies as well as our current and future projections, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, while the majority of our products are sourced and produced within the United Kingdom, continued or sustained adverse effects on the exchange rate of the pound sterling as compared to foreign currencies and the effective price inflation of certain products sourced from outside of the United Kingdom resulting from Brexit could result in increased costs with respect to the products that are sourced from outside of the United Kingdom. We cannot guarantee that we and our publicans would be able to mitigate or otherwise avoid such increased costs, and our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on 56 ----- our operating results, financial condition and prospects. Moreover, changes in the UK property market, caused by any negative development or uncertainty pursuant to Brexit, could negatively impact the value of our property portfolio and our ability to dispose of our assets and the realizations from such disposals. In addition, approximately 1,487 of Stonegate Group’s employees as of January 19, 2020 and approximately 385 of Ei Group’s employees as of December 28, 2019 were citizens of the European Union but not of the United Kingdom. Accordingly, any future restrictions, whether perceived or actual, on the free movement of EU nationals to and from the United Kingdom could impact our ability to efficiently recruit employees which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, we source beverage commodities from suppliers in the European Union. For instance, during the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, Stonegate Group sourced approximately 24% of its supplies based on total cost of sales from the suppliers in the European Union. In addition, our suppliers may source a significant quantity of beverages and other supplies from other suppliers in the European Union. Accordingly, the supply, pricing and general availability of these commodities is influenced by, and is subject to, the outcome of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Accordingly, Brexit may have an impact on suppliers’ trade relations and our ability to avoid the adverse effects of limited commodities or an increased price thereof is limited. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate following the withdrawal from the European Union, including financial laws and regulations, data privacy and collection laws and regulations and tax and free trade agreements, may increase costs associated with operating in the United Kingdom. Additionally, any substantial change in the regulations applicable to our business could jeopardize our ability to continue to operate in a manner consistent with our past practice.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,"We may be adversely affected by an increase in consumers purchasing alcohol from supermarkets, off-licenses and other retailers.","Consumers’ spending patterns with respect to alcohol have evolved such that they now purchase a higher proportion of their alcoholic drinks at supermarkets, off-licenses and other retailers than has been the case in the past. As a result of the temporary closure of pubs and restaurants in the United Kingdom because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more consumers than usual turned to these alternative sources to buy alcoholic drinks and may continue to do so in the future. In particular, the on-trade beer market in the United Kingdom has been adversely affected by the pricing policies of the large supermarket groups, with the off-trade beer market in the United Kingdom accounting for a greater proportion of United Kingdom beer sales than in the past. This change in behavior has been due, among other things, to growing health and drink driving concerns, the smoking ban, the ability of consumers to purchase canned or bottled beer at lower prices at off-license stores and supermarkets and the expansion of trading hours at those retailers, as well as to the increasing prevalence of cable and satellite television, high speed internet access and social media, which provide consumers with more options to entertain themselves at home. The foregoing factors have contributed to a decline in the total number of pubs in the United Kingdom over the past twenty years. Although the rate at which consumers were shifting their spending towards off-trade channels was no longer increasing prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend may change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability or desire of customers to gather in pubs may be limited for a significant length of time. Moreover, consumers could potentially form new spending habits that have a longer lasting impact. Accordingly, if the trend in consumers purchasing alcohol from supermarkets, off-licenses and other retailers were to resume along with a sustained decline in beer prices, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.7,"We face competition for consumers from other managed and tenanted pub operators, independent pubs, venues and restaurants.","We compete for consumers against a wide variety of pubs, bars, venues and restaurants, as well as off-license stores, supermarkets and takeaway restaurants, some of which may offer higher amenity levels or lower prices or may be backed by greater financial and operational resources. Following the Transaction, our main competitors include Greene King, Marston’s, Mitchells and Butlers, Star Pubs and Bars and JD Wetherspoon, but we also compete with smaller pub operators and independent pubs. In addition, consumer demand for casual dining chains, which have traditionally competed against pubs, has grown significantly in recent years, although recently casual dining supply has been in decline. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing competition from casual dining chains by changing 57 ----- our formats and food offering to meet consumer demand. Moreover, to the extent that venues such as coffee shops or delicatessens are able to offer alcoholic drinks, we may face increased competition. In addition, we also face increased competition in relation to our late night venues. We may not be successful in competing against any or all of these alternatives and a sustained loss of customers to other pubs, bars, casual dining chains or other venues could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.8,Consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to drink and food may continue to change and we may be unable to adapt to such changes.,"Our business is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to both drink and food, as well as demographic trends over time. For instance, many consumers are placing increasing importance on dietary and nutritional content, as well as the provenance of locally sourced ingredients. Consumers are also increasingly demanding all-day formats and increasingly preferring premium drinks. In addition, with the advent and prevalence of new drink-driving laws and entertainment alternatives, such as social media, younger generations now require more non-traditional offerings to be attracted to pubs. The United Kingdom pub industry has, as a result of these and other factors, been experiencing a steady decrease in the number of tenanted and leased pubs in recent years. We have responded to these trends by offering a greater number of healthy options in our menus, increasing our focus on our breakfast offering and expanding our premium drink offering. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be able to respond to these or other trends in consumer preference by introducing changes to our formats, brands, drink and food offerings and premises or otherwise. Moreover, our ability to respond to changes in consumer behavior is also conditioned on the willingness of each of our publicans to work with us to implement our suggested changes. Any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond to trends in consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.9,Our management may not be able to successfully implement our strategic and financial objectives.,"We recognize that the Transaction presents a unique opportunity for us to gain scale in the UK pub market and to capture value through the integration and enhancement of the combined group’s estates. We seek to do this by, among other things, continuing to invest in our managed pubs segment, supporting our publicans in operating better pubs, implementing opportunistic conversions to our operating models and formats (e.g., conversions from publican partnership pubs to managed pubs), exploiting the potential offered by the Craft Union operating model (e.g., conversions of certain of our fully-managed pubs into operator-managed pubs), realizing the significant cost savings offered by the combination of Stonegate Group and Ei Group and making strategic disposals in the ordinary course of business. See “Summary— Our Strategies.” There can, however, be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our strategies. In particular, we may be required to invest more than we have currently budgeted in order to implement our investment and conversion plans and we may not realize anticipated levels of EBITDA-based increase or cost efficiencies from such investments or conversions. In addition, we may not have sufficient expertise, resources or time to build the necessary support infrastructure to achieve our strategies in the desired timeframe or at all. Management’s time and attention from daily operations may also be diverted. The measures we may need to implement to respond to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic or any other unforeseen circumstances could also require us to adjust or abandon our plans. If we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategic or financial objectives, or if we are required to spend more than we anticipated to achieve those objectives, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.10,"We could face partner/labor shortages, increased labor costs and other adverse effects of varying labor conditions.","The development and success of our managed pubs depend, in large part, on the efforts, abilities and experience of the general managers who manage and operate our pubs. The development and success of the leased and tenanted pubs we have acquired as part of the Transaction depends, in large part, on the efforts, abilities and experience of publicans. Further, licensed restaurants, cafes and bars may offer attractive alternative business opportunities for the type of partners that we would like to work with. If we are not successful in attracting enough high quality prospective managers and publicans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified 58 ----- employees, including head office employees, regional managers, pub managers, kitchen staff, bar staff and wait staff. Qualified individuals are needed to fill these positions and our inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new pubs or result in our existing pubs being understaffed, which could compromise the level of service provided by these pubs. Any significant delay in finding qualified employees or to the extent a significant proportion of our managers or employees are not able to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also incur additional costs in relation to training new employees as a result of high turnover of our employee base. Specifically, in relation to our late night venues, we generally face a relatively higher turnover of employees. We may not be able to find qualified employees for such venues in time or at all. Furthermore, in the aftermath of temporary personnel initiatives implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our relationship with our employees may deteriorate and may result, among others, in strikes, work slowdowns, requests for additional compensation or healthcare benefits that could increase costs, and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to implement our COVID-19 mitigation plans. Thus, the steps undertaken to reduce labor costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees and our reputation may suffer as a result. Possible restrictions on the free movement of labor resulting from Brexit could lead to further difficulties in finding qualified employees. In addition, competition for qualified employees or increases in remuneration by our competitors could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficiently qualified employees, which could result in higher labor costs. Further, increases in the minimum hourly wage, employment tax rates or levies, related benefits costs or similar matters over which we have no control may increase our operating costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.11,Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business.,"Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s pubs are subject to laws and regulations that affect their operations, including those related to employment, minimum wages, alcoholic drinks control, late-night levies, drinkdriving, pub licensing, leisure (gaming) machines, competition, health and safety, environmental liabilities, sanitation, data protection, access for the disabled and, in the case of Ei Group Publican Partnerships, MRO under the Pubs Code. The responsibility to comply with these regulations is typically distributed based on operational control over the relevant sites. Generally, we are responsible for regulatory compliance in respect of Ei Group Managed Operations whereas publicans are responsible for regulatory compliance, including in respect of employment regulations, for the pubs they operate. These laws and regulations impose a significant administrative burden, as managers and publicans have to devote significant time to ensure compliance with these requirements and therefore have less time to dedicate to trade. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has prescribed detailed guidelines to maintain social distancing and hygiene measures in our pubs to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures have increased, or if additional or more stringent measures were to be imposed in the future, will increase, the burden on management and publicans and could also lead to findings of material breaches and related enforcement action for failures to comply with such requirements, which could adversely affect our operating results and, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition and prospects.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.12,a._** **_Pubs Code provides certain publican tenants the MRO option,"On November 18, 2014, the UK Parliament introduced a series of amendments to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment bill which contained the Pubs Code that came into effect on July 21, 2016. These include the requirement for large pub-owning businesses that own 500 or more tied pubs in England and Wales to provide their tenants and leaseholders, at certain specified times or on the occurrence of certain specified events (such as five-yearly rent reviews), with the MRO option that is overseen by an independent adjudicator. Such independent adjudicator has, among others, the power to require pub-owning businesses to pay in each financial year a levy towards the adjudicator’s expenses. Moreover, the Pubs Code also discourages the increases in price for beer (CPI+3%), other alcoholic drinks (CPI+8%), products other than alcoholic drinks (CPI+20%) and services (CPI+20%), which can limit our ability to pass on cost increases to publicans. It contemplates fines of up to 1% of the pub-owning group’s annual turnover for breach of the provisions of the Pubs Code. 59 ----- The MRO option enables some occupational tenants to opt-out of the supply tie at certain points or after certain events during the term of their lease agreement and occupy the premises on a standard commercial property lease, paying rent only. Accordingly, there is a risk that all or a substantial majority of the Ei Group’s publicans with long-term leases may opt for the MRO option over a period of time and convert their lease agreements to free-of-tie arrangements. In the event that a large number of Ei Group’s publicans elect to invoke this option, while our income derived from the supply of tied drinks products would be partially offset by increases in rent, our total income would likely decline. While the introduction of the MRO has not yet had a material impact on Ei Group’s business, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case. In particular, as of September 30, 2019, 1,626 out of Ei Group’s 4,011 (40.5%) sites operated on a tied lease and from the date of the introduction of the Pubs Code to September 30, 2019, there have been 1,662 rent review or agreement renewal events which could potentially have triggered an MRO request. As required under the Pubs Code, Ei Group issued 385 MRO offers in response to requests by tenants of which 213 have been concluded by way of mutually agreed tied deals and 52 have resulted in new mutually agreed MRO terms. In addition, 3 pubs have been sold, 29 leases have been repurchased from the occupational tenant with the balance of 88 pending. Of the outstanding 88, 36 have been referred to the Pubs Code adjudicator for determination. The Pubs Code also contemplates other rent setting provisions beyond the MRO. Furthermore, while the Pubs Code has now been in place for more than three years, there still remains a lack of clarity around some areas of the Pubs Code leaving elements open to interpretation. In addition, the Pubs Code is currently undergoing a consultation and statutory review. There is no clear indication as to the likely outcome of such review and this adds extra uncertainty about the interpretation and application of Pubs Code going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The WT Regulations also set out rights and protections in areas such as minimum rest time, days off and paid leave. A substantial majority of our employees (but not including our general managers) are covered by the WT Regulations. The existence of the ability to opt out of, and the guidance as to who is covered by, the WT Regulations may change in the future. In addition, under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (the “Part Time Workers Regulations”), part-time workers can claim the same employment and related rights as full-time workers. The Fixed Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 (the “Fixed Term Employees Regulations”) similarly provide that employees engaged under fixed-term contracts can claim the same employment and related rights as employees engaged under permanent contracts. The WT Regulations, Part Time Workers Regulations and Fixed Term Employees Regulations, and any changes to such regulations, may impose constraints on our ability to deploy employees efficiently to a degree that could adversely affect our operating costs and, in turn, our operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, there are additional regulatory constraints for employees under the age of 18, including among others, with regard to maximum working hours, working times and holiday entitlement. In April 2016, the UK government announced the introduction of a National Living Wage, which replaced the national minimum wage for all working people aged 25 and over in the United Kingdom. The National Minimum Wage remained in place for all working people under the age of 25 who are at least school leaving age in the United Kingdom. In April 2019, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the United Kingdom to 18 was increased to £4.35 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 24 was increased to £6.15 per hour and £7.70 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 25 and over was increased to £8.21 per hour. In April 2020, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the United Kingdom to 18 was increased to £4.55 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 24 was increased to £6.45 per hour and £8.20 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 25 and over was increased to to £8.72 per hour. As Stonegate Group employs a large number of staff at the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, any further increase in the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, or their scope, could affect our operating costs. Furthermore, we may be required to raise the salaries of our other employees in order to preserve the pay differential vis à vis our employees who are employed at 60 ----- the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage. Any resulting increase in labor costs could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. To the extent our employees are required to wear a uniform, we are required to record their cost as an expense to ensure that the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, as applicable, is met. In 2018, HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) identified numerous employers in the United Kingdom that allegedly failed to pay the correct minimum wage. Charging staff for uniforms (or expecting them to fund their own independently), failing to pay overtime and issues around job-related travel expenses were some of the reasons given by HMRC for salaries falling below the minimum wage threshold. Identified employers, including us, were required to compensate employees and pay fines against this potential liability. In addition to companies being required to make compensation payments and pay fines, individuals may be also subject to criminal prosecution for deliberately not complying with the relevant legislation in relation to minimum wage standards and anyone found guilty may be disqualified from being a company director for up to 15 years.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The government in the United Kingdom periodically imposes measures relating to the consumption of alcohol, including the reduction of licensing hours, raising the legal drinking age, the introduction of minimum prices for alcoholic drinks and the introduction of a mandatory code imposing certain conditions on all alcohol retailers, such as a ban on indoor smoking. For example, in 2018, Scotland introduced minimum prices for alcoholic drinks and the Royal Assembly of Wales has also recently adopted minimum prices for alcoholic drinks. Any such measures could reduce our flexibility to implement profitable business strategies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As car drivers and passengers account for a significant proportion of pub customers in the United Kingdom, the implementation of any legislation to reduce further the legal blood alcohol limit for drivers in the United Kingdom, or an increase in public service advertising warning against the dangers of drinkdriving could result in customers in our rural and suburban pubs drinking less or frequenting pubs less often, which could lead to a reduction in revenue in those pubs and a decline in our income from the sale of alcoholic drinks. For example, in 2014, Scotland introduced new legislation which decreased the legal blood alcohol limit. While such legislation has not had a material impact on our operations, there can be no assurance that our operations would be similarly unaffected if the UK government were to impose similar legislation across the rest of the United Kingdom.

The licensing authorities also have the power to choose the period during which the levy applies every night, between midnight and 6 a.m., and decide what exemptions and reductions should apply. Certain pubs, particularly those operating in urban areas, are open after midnight, and may be subject to “late night levy” charges, which came into force in October 2012. These annual charges range between £299 for small premises and £4,440 for larger venues, and are subject to potential increases. Even though most of our pubs have not yet had such a late-night levy imposed on them, to the extent that individual licensing authorities decide to exercise their power under the act or the government in the United Kingdom decides to increase these powers, it could result in increased costs for us or our publicans, as the case may be, and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 61 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Furthermore, if we or any of our publicans were to become insolvent, the relevant licenses could lapse and, under the UK Licensing Act of 2003 (the “UK Licensing Act”), insolvency is defined to include the approval of a voluntary arrangement proposed by the company’s directors, the appointment of an administrator in respect of the company, the appointment of an administrative receiver in respect of the company or going into liquidation. If we or our publicans are unable to maintain the relevant licenses or if we or our publicans face a significant number of difficulties or failures in obtaining and/or maintaining required licenses or approvals that could delay or prohibit the operation of our pubs, that could have a material effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, licensing requirements which affect our pubs are subject to change, and additional or more stringent requirements may be imposed on our operations in the future. This could result in us or our publicans losing licenses or having increased operating costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, the provision of leisure machines in premises which have the benefit of a premises license is governed by the Gambling Act 2005. The Gambling Act 2005, as amended by the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014, includes explicit monetary limits on stakes and prizes and new social responsibility provisions requiring close supervision of games. Our pubs typically operate under gambling licenses from local licensing authorities, who have the discretion to terminate licenses that have been granted or otherwise change the licensing requirements.

Changes in law and practices that affect all or any of these matters may adversely affect our financial performance. In particular, the government in the United Kingdom imposed a duty escalator which commenced in April 23, 2009, pursuant to which duties on alcohol rise each year by 2% above the rate of inflation (based on RPI). In the March 2016 budget, duty rates on wine and made-wine at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by volume rose at the same rate as RPI inflation, but the UK government froze in cash terms the duty rates on beer, spirits and other drinks above 22% alcohol by volume and still cider and lower strength sparkling cider. In the March 2017 budget, the duty rates on alcohol manufactured in, or imported into, the United Kingdom rose at the same rate as forecast RPI inflation, and in the November 2017 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders were frozen. In the October 2018 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders remained frozen but specifically duty rates on wine and made-wine at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by volume rose at the same rate as RPI inflation. In the March 2020 budget, duties on beer, cider and wine were frozen.

Further, in relation to Publican Partnerships, duty increases will typically be absorbed by publicans but, to the extent that we do pass on duty increases to publicans which results in price increases for their customers, it could result in decreased demand of beer and other alcohol beverages by publicans’ customers and consequently could also have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

At revaluation, all properties are given a new ratable value and multiplier which, depending on the underlying movement in the value of the property, can have a significant impact on the tax liability due on the property. In addition, and despite the UK government’s recent announcement regarding an increase in business rate reliefs for smaller UK businesses (including business rate reliefs for businesses with a ratable value of less than £51,000), UK government may limit such business rates relief for larger corporations or to certain industries, which could increase the monetary burden on some businesses in the United Kingdom.

Following the Transaction, in addition to investments in the Stonegate Group estate, we also plan to make investments in the Ei Group’s estate. Following these investments, there can be no assurance that we will continue to achieve our target return on investment with respect to our uninvested sites, whether as a result of incorrect assumptions in evaluating the investment potential or otherwise, or that we will successfully identify the sites that are most in need of investment or are most suitable for conversion into different operating models or formats. In addition, in order to remain competitive, evolving industry trends with respect to the frequency of capital investment may require capital investments to be made in pubs more frequently than we have done in the past or plan to do in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to make capital investments on a shorter timeline than we have done in the past should such trends emerge. We may also not be successful in deploying capital expenditure for maintenance across our estate, particularly in light of the significant increase in the size of our estate following the Transaction and our efforts to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity while we suffer the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, although we have historically financed our capital expenditure from cash flows from operations, there can be no assurance that we will not in the future encounter difficulties in financing our capital expenditure, particularly in light of our reduced cash flow from operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, where we present Stonegate Group Return on Investment in this Offering Memorandum, we have not included in the calculation the results of pubs that have traded for fewer than 52 weeks following such investments.

In addition, footfall at many of these pubs, particularly those with Sky TV, BT Sport or other large screen offerings, is affected by major sporting events, such as the World Cup, European Championships, Champions’ League, FA Cup, Rugby World Cup, Six Nations and The Ashes. British teams’ performance in those events can also have an impact on footfall, which if materially different from our expectations, could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, if a British team does not progress beyond the group stages of the World Cup or the European Championship, this generally represents a lost opportunity in terms of footfall and drinks and food sales at our pubs. Moreover, measures taken in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the cancellation or postponement of sporting events, holding sporting events behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, and regulating customer behavior at pubs in line with UK government’s guidelines (for example, ensuring broadcast of sporting events at volumes below conversational levels, taking steps to ensure that people do not raise their voices to avoid potential risks from aerosol transmission, reconfiguring indoor spaces to ensure that customers remain seated) could also have an impact on footfall in our pubs, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Weather patterns can also affect footfall across our pubs. Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather, particularly during the summer months, over our peak trading periods or over weekends, adversely affects us.

We also enter into distribution arrangements with some of our suppliers. In addition, our drinks supply contracts must be renewed from time to time. While we negotiate contract renewals where desirable, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining renewals of our existing contracts with our suppliers on the same or similar terms, or at all. Failure to timely agree renewals with our suppliers and distributors, termination of these agreements or a variation of its terms could cause distribution or supply disruptions and could increase costs if we are required to find alternative suppliers and distributors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 66 ----- In addition, we primarily source our food supply from a single supplier. If the trend in consolidation in the brewing and distribution industry were to continue, this could further increase our reliance on a limited number of suppliers and distributors and, therefore we would continue to be subject to their bargaining power, which could have the effect of increasing the prices we pay for our supplies. Furthermore, if our suppliers and distributors face financial difficulties, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fail to deliver the agreed level of service, we could encounter difficulties replacing these suppliers, which could result in disruptions to our business and/or significant costs being incurred. Moreover, any disaster in our head office could seriously disrupt our daily operations.

We also consume significant amounts of gas and electricity in our managed pubs operations, and are therefore subject to fluctuations in energy costs. Volatility in global food and drink prices and energy costs have in the past had a negative impact on our managed pubs operating margins. Prices remain subject to volatility and, if further rises were to occur (including as a result of a depreciation of the pound sterling), this could result in an increase in our costs and we may not be able to increase our prices to offset any such increases in our costs without suffering reduced revenue. Our gross margins could therefore be adversely affected, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.30,"Leasing and ownership of a significant portfolio of real estate exposes us to possible impairments, liabilities and losses.","The property market is subject to fluctuations in value, and if the property market resumes a downturn it could lead to a sustained reduction in our freehold and leasehold property values over time, which may impact our business. Any fluctuations in the valuation of our property portfolio may impact our ability to dispose of our properties at an appropriate value, which may impede our ability to fulfil our planned business strategy. There can be no certainty that property values will recover from any downturn at any particular time, or at all. Moreover, all property valuations are inherently subjective, made on the basis of assumptions that may not reflect the true position of such property. There is no assurance that the valuations of Stonegate Group’s property portfolio will reflect actual sale prices or that there will be sufficient demand or available buyers to sell any of our assets at the right value or at all. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in a decline in our freehold and leasehold property values, which we are unable to exactly quantify at this time. As of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, we have recognized £24 million of impairment charge for property, plant and equipment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Recent Developments—Impairment Review.” We can provide no assurance that a further material impairment loss of assets will not occur in a future period, and the risk of future material impairments has been significantly heightened as result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Further impairment losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to secure financing. Approximately 64% of Stonegate Group’s property portfolio (based on number of sites) was short leasehold as of September 29, 2019 and 10% of Ei Group’s property portfolio (based on number of sites) was leasehold as of September 30, 2019. In addition, Ei Group has a number of commercial non-pub properties or areas used for purposes ancillary to pubs (such as car parks or gardens) where the associated pub is held freehold, but the non-pub property is either wholly or partly under a leasehold title (together with our leasehold pubs, the “Leasehold Properties”). Stonegate Group’s short leaseholds have unexpired lease terms of less than 50 years and are subject to periodic rent reviews and renegotiation of rents when leases are renewed. Rents may increase such that they affect the economic viability of one or more of such properties. Further, as leases underlying our pubs, bars or venues expire, we may be unable to negotiate a new lease or lease extension, either on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close our pubs in desirable locations. As a result, our sales and our brand building initiatives could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we are generally not entitled to cancel leases, and if an existing or future pub is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Also, in case of some of our leasehold properties, the landlord may have an option to break the lease with no compensation payable to us. If any such options were exercised, we may be deprived of the capital value 67 ----- in the relevant leasehold properties as well as ongoing income. Moreover, a majority of our leasehold properties contain forfeiture provisions pursuant to which the landlord may terminate the lease upon the insolvency of the tenant. The termination of any such lease by a landlord could deprive us of any capital value in the relevant leasehold interest as well as the ongoing income from the relevant property. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, certain of our leasehold properties are or may in the future become subject to disputed claims between us and the landlords of those leasehold properties. For example, under certain of our lease agreements landlords can, and occasionally do, challenge the permissibility of the uses to which we put the properties subject to those leases, and in some cases our landlords may be required to provide consent before we are able to make changes to the formats at certain of our leasehold pubs. In addition, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be disputes in the future between us and the landlords of our leasehold sites in relation to the deferral of rent payments for the duration of the temporary closure of our pubs and other related issues. Our inability to successfully resolve disputes between us and the landlords of the leasehold pubs that we own or operate could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and prospects. Furthermore, a limited number of our freehold and leasehold agreements contain covenants prohibiting the operation of public houses on the premises and some of our publican partnership properties are and may continue to be subject to restrictive covenants or title conditions that for example limit the sale of alcohol on the premises, prohibit their operation as a pub or only allow use of the property for residential purposes. We have been operating pubs on several premises that are subject to such covenants and may, as a result, be in breach of these covenants, although we have not faced challenge on these grounds so far, however, a successful claim by a party claiming the benefit of such a covenant or condition might result in the cessation of the current use and frustration of the relevant occupational lease and could limit our ability to dispose of or re-let the relevant property. While insurance can be taken out to address these risks, there can be no assurance that we will have taken out title indemnity insurance in respect of the breach of those covenants or conditions. Moreover, our lease agreements typically contain covenants relating to the repair and condition of the property. We do not review the state of repair or condition of our pubs on a regular basis and may, from time to time, be in breach of these covenants. Moreover, our landlords may require us to carry out works to our properties in order to maintain them to the standard required by the lease at any time during the term of the lease and also at the end of the lease. Furthermore, where the interest held in a property is comprised either wholly or partly under a leasehold title and that property is damaged or destroyed such that business cannot be operated from that property until rebuilding or repair work is undertaken, the landlord may have a right to break the lease if the property cannot be rebuilt within a certain period. In addition, in respect of both freehold and the Leasehold Properties, there can be no assurances that the property can be rebuilt within a certain specified period. In such circumstances, our operational tenants may cease to operate their business at the relevant freehold or leasehold properties because (i) it is not viable for them to wait for rebuilding or repair; or (ii) they may wish to continue to operate from an alternative site and then chooses not to return; or (iii) they may lose their license to operate. Thus, such damage or destruction could deprive us of cash flow of capital value in the relevant freehold or leasehold properties and/or ongoing income from operational tenants. Additionally, a small number of our properties have uncertain title, as a result of which either our or our landlords’ ability to own the freeholds or leaseholds, respectively, to those properties can potentially be challenged. If, due to these reasons, we are unable to continue to occupy and operate certain of our pubs, that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

It is possible that rents from these pubs could decrease if the open market rental value at the time of review is less than the rent then payable. Moreover, regardless of the terms of the relevant rent review provision and in accordance with the Pubs Code, we may agree or be required to lower the rent payable, as appropriate, in light of economic or other circumstances. In addition, some of the tenancy agreements and leases for Ei Group’s pubs also provide for annual rent reviews by reference to negative movements in the RPI or the consumer price index (“CPI”). A negative RPI or CPI would reduce the rents payable in respect of those pubs. Additionally, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to negotiate 68 ----- competitive rents or may need to continue to provide rent concessions and rent holidays. Any of the foregoing developments could decrease our revenues which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Because, following the Transaction, a substantial portion of our revenues derive from rent and revenues from the provision of beer and other drink products to our tied publicans, declining sales and pub failures as a result of factors over which we have no direct control, such as poor pub management, poor or declining food quality and safety, ineffective marketing, changing local demographic trends or otherwise as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in a decline in our operating results. In addition, publicans may buy beer and other drink products from other suppliers or tamper with equipment monitoring the flow of draught beverages in contravention of their tied agreements with us, and enforcement of such agreements may not be effective. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.33,Licensees may fail to pay amounts due promptly or at all.,"There is a general risk that rental and other payments owing to us from publicans (including, for example, for the supply of beer) will not be paid on the due date or will not be paid at all. This is exacerbated by the financial challenges faced by our publicans as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A sufficient aggregation of such late or non-payments would affect our profitability. Continued failure by a particular publican to pay rental and other payments due to us will usually result in the termination of the publican’s lease and either the closure of the pub or business or our leasing to a new publican. Where a pub is leased to a new publican, there may also be a period following the departure of the former publican during which cash flow to us is reduced. The relevant property may also become vacant which would reduce revenue and our ability to recover certain operating costs (which would result in us incurring additional expenses until the property is re-let). In addition, the rent and other payments payable by the replacement publican may not be as high as those paid by the former publican. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

In the event of a compulsory purchase order being made in respect of a property, compensation would be payable on the basis of the open market value of all owners’ and publicans’ proprietary interests in that property at the time of the related purchase. However, the amount received from the proceeds of compulsory purchase of the relevant freehold could be inadequate to cover the loss of cash flow from such property. Further, there is often a delay between the compulsory purchase of a property and the payment of compensation, largely dependent upon the ability of the property owner and the entity acquiring the property to agree on the open market value. Any delay in our receipt of funds from a compulsory purchase could have an adverse impact on our revenues or affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The rise of online news reporting, discussion forums and social media has increased the risk to brands of attracting negative publicity given the ease and speed with which such information is disseminated. We are particularly susceptible to such risks given the high degree of engagement with social media by certain of our key customer groups such as the student population. Adverse publicity may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are valid, whether they are limited to a single pub or whether we are at fault. Furthermore, many of our pubs operate leisure machines, and any negative publicity in relation to gambling by minors, the use of leisure machines in pubs and other concerns with the gambling industry, even if not directly connected to 69 ----- us, may adversely impact our pubs. In addition, a health and safety accident or incident at a property owned or leased by us that may lead to serious injury or even loss of life, could significantly affect our reputation. The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one of our pubs may extend far beyond the pub involved to affect some or all of our other pubs, as such impact may affect the public’s perception of the pub business in general and/or negatively affect our reputation in the pub industry, especially amongst potential publicans who are interested in partnering with us.

We are also susceptible to food and drink contamination, including in relation to issues involving integrity and traceability of food supplies. Any such contamination could lead to increased costs for our managed pubs, and, in seeking to address the contamination, we may be required to procure supplies from alternative suppliers or source alternate products. A serious contamination or threat of contamination at one of our branded managed pubs, bars or venues could also negatively affect the reputation of one or more of our managed brands. Further, if there is an issue in our food supply chain, including the provision of incorrect allergen information, that leads to serious illness or loss of life of one of our customers this could lead to restrictions in supply, potential increases in the cost of goods and reduced sales. We adopt and maintain rigorous health and safety policies. However, given the degree of access members of the public have to our premises, and particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our health and safety policies may not be able to prevent a serious health and safety incident from occurring on our premises, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and, as a result, on our operating results, financial condition and prospects. The occurrence of a serious health and safety incident at one of our branded managed pubs, bars or venues could also negatively affect the reputation of one or more of our brands. Furthermore, health and safety incidents, including in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, or contamination issues may from time to time result in our becoming subject to various claims and legal actions. No assurance can be given that we will not experience actual losses in connection with these legal actions or that new disputes will not arise under which we could face additional liabilities and reputational risk. Further, if incidents involving the abuse of alcohol, use of illegal drugs and violence continue to occur or increase in frequency on our premises, it may directly interrupt our operations and could result in litigation or regulatory action or have an impact on our reputation.

In addition, we may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, including asbestos, on or in a property owned or leased by us. The costs of any required removal, investigation or remediation of such substances may be substantial thus, if we were found to be liable for the costs arising from any of these or other obligations or if publicans were unable to meet their rental payments as a result of such obligations (including fines for non-compliance), our revenue could be adversely affected.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.39,We may need to increase contributions to cover deficits with respect to our pension schemes.,"Stonegate Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension scheme (each a “Stonegate Group Pension Scheme” and together, the “Stonegate Group Pension Schemes”). These are both closed to new entrants. As of September 29, 2019, the present value of funded defined benefit obligations was £106 million, across both schemes, calculated on an IAS 19 basis. In addition, the deficit in respect of the Stonegate Group Pension Schemes as of April 12, 2020 was £8 million. There are many risks arising from the operation of the Stonegate Group Pension Schemes. The pensions regulator in the United Kingdom (the “Pensions Regulator”), for instance, may impose a scheme funding target and employer contribution rate, if those matters cannot be agreed between the scheme trustees and the relevant employers. In addition, the trustees of either Stonegate Group Pension Scheme may wind up the relevant scheme, as permitted in certain circumstances. The Pensions Regulator also has statutory power to order a pension scheme to be wound up. Winding up the schemes would result in a statutory obligation on the various participating employers to fund the schemes by reference to a “buyout basis” (which represents the estimated cost of securing members’ benefits by purchasing annuity policies from an insurance company). The Pensions Regulator may require funding or funding guarantees from our members (in the form of a contribution notice or financial support direction) for defined benefit pension schemes in various circumstances. In addition, the trustees of the Stonegate Group Pension Schemes may alter the investment profile of the relevant scheme. For example, the trustee could exchange equity investments for lower risk investments such as bonds, which would typically increase the employer funding obligations in relation to the schemes because of the lower rate of return expected from lower risk investments. The foregoing risks are linked to the funding level of the Stonegate Group Pension Schemes, which may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: (i) reducing bond yields (since lower yields mean a pension obligation is assessed as having a higher value); (ii) increasing life expectancy (which will make pensions payable for longer and, therefore, more expensive to provide); (iii) investment returns failing to meet expectations; (iv) actual and expected price inflation, subject to the limits set out in the Pension Schemes’ governing documentation; (v) funding volatility as a result of any mismatch between the assets held and the assets by reference to which the scheme liabilities are calculated; and (vi) other events occurring which make past service benefits more expensive than anticipated in the actuarial assumptions by reference to which past pension contributions were assessed, including unanticipated changes to tax or other legislation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Our operations therefore depend on the continued and uninterrupted functioning of our IT systems. The centralization of many aspects of our operations, such as purchasing, marketing, property, finance, human resources and IT, to a certain extent make such functions more vulnerable to a catastrophic failure at the site or sites at which the IT systems underlying such functions are physically located. If any of our IT systems were to be disabled or were to malfunction or cease operating properly or as designed, including as a result of computer security breaches, computer viruses, problems with the internet or sabotage, we could suffer disruption to our business and supply chains, regulatory intervention, reputational damage or incur liability to retailers or customers or experience loss of data. Further, there is a risk that inadequate disaster recovery plans and information security processes are in place to mitigate against a system outage, or failure to ensure appropriate back-up facilities (covering key business systems and the recovery of critical data) and loss of sensitive data. This could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct our business which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, our online presence, the quantity of customer and employee information held by us, and following the COVID-19 pandemic, remote working and increase in employee health data being processed by us, means that we are in possession of personal data and must therefore comply with strict data protection and privacy laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”).",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Further consolidation in the pub industry in the United Kingdom, could lead to additional downward pricing pressures on our offering. In connection with further consolidation, competitors could also reinvigorate and/or modernize older pubs, which could negatively affect our consumer attendance. In addition, any future consolidation in the brewing and distribution industry could force us to rely on a limited number of suppliers, and consequently, those suppliers may be able to exert pressures on us that could increase the prices we pay for our supplies. Therefore, if we cannot continue to be a major participant in the pub industry in the United Kingdom, we may not be able to secure favorable pricing from suppliers or attract, or retain suitable employees and managers to operate and manage our managed pubs or retain or attract suitable publicans for our leased and tenanted pubs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 significantly change the data protection landscape in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Such laws and regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into supplier contracts, employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations. If a significant or widely publicized unlawful disclosure of supplier, employee or customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a cyber-attack, the failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence, the actions of our suppliers or otherwise, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines or other enforcement action which could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences and could harm our reputation. Such risks of unlawful disclosure of customer data is particularly heightened in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as UK government’s guidelines for pubs require us to keep a temporary record of customers for 21 days and assist National Health Service’s Test and Trace service with requests for data if needed.

Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including current or former customers who visit our pubs, employees, investors or regulators and litigants of previously acquired businesses.

These adjustments are based on certain assumptions. For example, we have made an adjustment of £80 million representing the aggregate cost savings that we expect to realize in connection with the Transaction. Our estimated costs savings reflect estimated procurement savings, savings resulting from optimizing site operations and savings from extracting possible head office synergies that we believe we will be able to achieve through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group, and by gaining increased scale through combined operations. Any cost savings that we believe we can realize in relation to the Transaction are based on our past experience and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.

It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the period presented or any future period, and may not be comparable to our historical consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, it should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. If we are unable to realize our estimated cost savings, or achieve estimated EBITDA-based increases based on our other assumptions, or if the costs in achieving these projected EBITDA-based increases are significantly higher than our current estimates, that may cause our actual financial performance to differ significantly from that implied by the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) presented in this Offering Memorandum, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

DCL has prepared the Stonegate Group Valuation Report in respect of Stonegate Group’s portfolio of 74 ----- 761 freehold and leasehold properties as of September 29, 2019. As of September 29, 2019, Stonegate Group’s property portfolio consisted of 763 sites, and it subsequently disposed of two sites. The Stonegate Group Valuation Report excluded these two sites and valued 761 sites as of September 29, 2019. The Offering Memorandum also refers to the Ei Group Valuation Reports issued by Avison Young in respect of Ei Group’s properties that secure the Ei Corporate Bonds and Colliers in respect of Unique Group’s properties, in each case as of September 30, 2019. The Valuation Reports are based on desktop valuations of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s portfolios of freehold and leasehold properties, with limited on-site inspection. As a result of the limited due diligence and property inspections, each of DCL, Avison Young and Colliers made a number of assumptions in order to value the properties. For instance, in respect of the Stonegate Group Valuation Report, DCL has, among other things, (i) not measured the properties but has relied upon the floor areas provided by us; (ii) only undertaken inspections of approximately 10% of the total portfolio of properties covered in the Stonegate Group Valuation Report; (iii) not carried out any investigations into the past or present uses of the properties, nor of any neighboring land, in order to establish whether there is any potential for contamination and have therefore assumed that none exists and (iv) not undertaken structural surveys and not inspected any part of the properties that are covered, unexposed or inaccessible, or tested any of the electrical, heating, drainage or other services, and no assurance is given that the properties are free from defect. Similarly, in respect of the Ei Group Valuation Reports, Avison Young and/or Colliers have, (i) assumed that the buildings are capable of being insured by reputable insurers at reasonable market rates;(ii) not made any allowance for legal fees or any other costs or expenses which would be incurred on the sale of the property, except where appropriate, and in accordance with market practice for the asset type, they have made deductions to reflect purchasers’ acquisition costs; (iii) not undertaken any form of technical, building or deleterious material survey and have not reviewed, or given warranties as to, the condition of the structure, foundations, soil and services; and (iv) not provided a formal environmental assessment and have not carried out any soil, geological or other tests or surveys in order to ascertain the site conditions or other environmental conditions of the property. If valuations with the benefit of full inspections took place, then the assumptions adopted may have been different and, as a result, the actual valuations could be materially different from those reported in the Valuation Reports. For this reason, you should not, and are not entitled to, rely upon the valuations taken from the Valuation Reports and reported herein for the purposes of making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. Other appraisers may reach different valuations of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s property portfolio. Moreover, the value determined in the Valuation Reports could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of the property portfolios, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario. Accordingly, the Valuation Reports should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future value of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s property portfolio. The realizable value of the property portfolios at any given time will depend on various factors, including: - market, economic and industry conditions, including demand and capacity for our services; - whether any additional property sales are anticipated; - the effect any sale may have on the remaining portfolio; - the availability of buyers; - the availability of financing; - the time period in which the properties are to be sold; - the supply of similar properties; - the condition of the properties; - regulatory risks, including obtaining any necessary consents required to transfer our pub operations; and - other operational cost risks. In addition, we anticipate that the appraised value of Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s property portfolio will change over time, and it may change materially. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in a decline in our freehold and leasehold property values. We have recognized £24 million of impairment charge for property, plant and equipment during the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying 75 ----- amount may not be recoverable and recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds. However, the Stonegate Group Property Asset Value and Ei Group Property Asset Value have not been adjusted for any potential decline in property values due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of potential targets or assets, to identify possible risks associated with such acquisitions and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of the relevant acquisition to achieve the objectives and anticipated benefits of the acquisition. When conducting due diligence, we typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an acquisition. We also involve external consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks in the due diligence process to varying degrees depending on the nature of the acquisition. When conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an acquisition, we rely on resources available to us, including information provided by the target and, in certain instances, information made available pursuant to third-party investigations. As Ei was a public listed company at the time we acquired it, the due diligence conducted in connection with the Transaction was largely restricted to publicly available information.

Additionally, the Unique Issuer may, subject to meeting certain requirements, issue additional notes, which could increase the level of our indebtedness. The Unique Issuer may also issue one or more classes of notes to replace one or more existing classes of Unique Securitized Notes.

LIBOR and EURIBOR could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the Floating Rate Notes and debt under our Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) or the LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. As a result, EURIBOR, LIBOR and other interest rates are indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of recent and ongoing national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) which was published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 29, 2016, and applies since January 1, 2018. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark, within the EU. It will, among other things (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). These reforms, including the Benchmarks Regulation, may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any Floating Rate Notes or our debt linked to such a “benchmark.” The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on any Floating Rate Notes and our other debt linked to such a “benchmark” in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the EURIBOR benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the EURIBOR benchmark. In addition, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks,” could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark,” including EURIBOR and LIBOR, and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the following effects on certain “benchmarks” such as EURIBOR: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to such “benchmark”; (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in the “benchmarks” or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the “benchmark.” On July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12, 2018) the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcements”). The FCA Announcements indicate that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis, or at all, cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives or investigations, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to LIBOR and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Floating Rate Notes. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such Floating Rate Notes. 78 ----- Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks imposed by the Benchmarks Regulation reforms, or any other international reforms, any other risks imposed by the cessation or reform of certain reference rates, and investigations and licensing issues in making any investment decision with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. Investors should be aware that, if EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to the Floating Rate Notes. This may in certain circumstances (i) be reliant upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the EURIBOR benchmark which, depending on market circumstances, may not be available at the relevant time, (ii) result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when EURIBOR was available or (iii) permit the Issuer to replace EURIBOR with any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in consultation with an independent financial advisor.

In particular, upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or in respect of the Unique Securitized Notes and the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, subject to any applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the relevant facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the relevant facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the New Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. We are also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the Revolving Facilities Agreement.

This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due. We also experience seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow. Attendance levels at our pubs are affected by the weather and by the timing of major sporting events. Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather, especially during the summer months or over our peak trading periods such as the Christmas period, Easter, bank holidays in the United Kingdom and end-of-the-month salary weekends, can have a negative effect on our cash flow. The absence of major sporting events, or the poor performance of a British team, could have a negative impact on our cash position, which could impact our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that revenue growth, currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations. See “—Risks Related to our Business—The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the United Kingdom and the global economy and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of unknown magnitude and duration, which may impact our liquidity and access to capital” and “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources.” In addition, we are subject to certain limitations under the agreements governing the Unique Securitized Notes and the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, including limitations on the ability of Unique Group to make certain upstream payments to us. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the New Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the New Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Indenture and the terms governing the Revolving Facilities, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facilities, the Unique Securitized Notes, the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement, and any future debt, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among other things, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In addition, not all of the assets of the Issuer, Stonegate Group and Ei Group will be secured. In particular, no security will be provided by any member of the Unique Group or with regard to any assets of the Unique Group. In addition, the security granted by Midco over its shares in Parent, will be non-recourse to Midco other than in relation to the charged shares. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Note Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must first be applied in satisfaction of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements and any Operating Facility (as 81 ----- defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and thereafter to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes and the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Indenture allows incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral. To the extent that other first priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture, the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral. The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the agreements governing the Unique Securitized Notes, the Unique Intercompany Loan Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. The exercise of the right of holders of the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt documents, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from members of our group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the Revolving Facilities Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay an equal amount of debt and cancel the corresponding commitments under our Revolving Facilities Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” Enforcement of any of the Note Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Note Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to decide that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note Guarantee which has not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. 87 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Future trading prices for the New Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the New Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the New Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the New Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the New Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the New Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the New Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the New Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the New Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by ICAEW, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors’ reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum each states that the relevant report has been prepared for the Parent and other named parties (the “Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the Addressees for an audit opinion from Stonegate Group Independent Auditors on the directors’ reports and financial statements; that the report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time; that the report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors other than the Addressees for any purpose or in any context; that any party other than the Addressees who obtains access to the report or a copy and chooses to rely on the report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk; and that to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of the report to any other party. In the context of the Offering, the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors have reconfirmed to us that they do not intend their duty of care in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such as investors in and purchasers of the Notes, other than the Addressees of their reports. 90 ----- Without in any way or on any basis affecting or adding to or extending the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors’ duties and responsibilities to the Addressees or giving rise to any duty or responsibility being accepted or assumed by or imposed on the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors to any party except the Addressees, the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors have provided consent to the Parent’s inclusion, independently of the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors, of the audit reports with the historical financial statements to which they relate in this Offering Memorandum for the proposed issuance of the New Notes, thereby demonstrating that an audit of the directors’ reports and financial statements for each relevant period has been undertaken for the Addressees. The consent provided by the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors is different from a consent filed with the SEC under Section 7 of the Securities Act, which is applicable only to transactions involving securities registered under the Securities Act.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and purchasers of the New Notes may have against the Stonegate Group Independent Auditors based on their reports or the directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which Stonegate Group Independent Auditors may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom.

Where the line item descriptions in Ei Group’s income statement are different to those of Stonegate Group’s income statement, or where we have reclassified certain items on Ei Group’s income statement to show them based on Stonegate Group’s income statement presented above, we have noted them below. (i) Represents Operating costs before depreciation and amortisation on Ei’s Group’s income statement (£456 million). (ii) Represents EBITDA on Ei’s Group’s income statement (£268 million). (iii) Represents the sum of Depreciation and amortisation (£21 million) and Goodwill impairment (£232 million), in each case, derived from Ei’s Group’s income statement. (iv) Represents Net loss on sale of property (£42 million) on Ei’s Group’s income statement. (v) Represents Interest receivable (£1 million) shown in the notes to Ei’s Group’s income statement.

(vii) Represents Taxation on Ei’s Group’s income statement (£10 million). (viii) Represents Loss after tax attributable to members of the Parent Company on Ei’s Group’s income statement (£209 million). (3) The following pro forma adjustments have been applied to the income statement information for Stonegate Group to give effect to the Transaction as though it had occurred on October 1, 2018: (a) Consolidation and accounting adjustments: (i) Reflecting estimated depreciation expense of £27 million, representing: - £11 million in depreciation expense that we believe we would have recorded for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 in relation to Ei Group’s licensed land and buildings. Ei Group held its licensed land and buildings at fair value and landlord’s fixtures and fittings and other assets at cost. Ei Group’s licensed land and buildings recognized under property, plant and equipment on its consolidated balance sheet were revalued each year by external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations. Freehold land was not depreciated. This is in contrast to Stonegate Group’s accounting policy where land and buildings, which are accounted for under the line item property, plant and equipment on Stonegate Group’s consolidated balance sheet, are held at cost less accumulated depreciation, and the related depreciation expense is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis. 96 ----- Beginning March 3, 2020, when the Transaction was completed, Ei Group’s results were consolidated with Stonegate Group’s results and were recorded based on Stonegate Group’s accounting policies. Ei Group’s licensed land and buildings were recorded at fair value as of March 3, 2020 and, from that date onward, their value was depreciated on a straight line basis; - £8 million in depreciation expense that we believe we would have recorded for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 based on aligning the shorter life of Ei Group’s fixtures and fittings with Stonegate Group’s accounting policy of a sixyear life on fixtures and fittings; - £6 million in depreciation expense that we believe we would have recorded for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 based on the increase in the fair value of Ei Group’s right-of-use assets resulting from acquisition accounting, which, in turn would have resulted in higher depreciation expense; - £2 million in depreciation expense that we believe we would have recorded for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 based on assigning fair value to certain of Ei Group’s operating leases resulting from acquisition accounting, which had not previously been on its balance sheet and had not been amortized. (ii) Reflecting a reversal of £20 million, which is the amount recorded in respect of movement in valuation of the estate and related assets on Ei Group’s income statement because, following the Transaction, Ei Group’s estate and related assets will no longer be revalued as explained above. Accordingly, going forward, we will not record movements in estate valuation on our income statement. (iii) Reflecting an estimated net credit of £9 million under finance costs, representing: - £20 million of finance credit that we believe we would have recorded under finance costs for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 based on the increase in the fair value of the Unique Securitized Bonds resulting from acquisition accounting; and - £11 million of finance costs that we believe we would have recorded for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 based on the increase in the fair value of Ei Group’s right-of-use assets resulting from acquisition accounting described above. (iv) Reflecting an estimated tax credit of £3 million, representing the tax impact of the account adjustments described above. (b) Financing adjustments, reflecting an increase of £78 million in finance costs, representing: (A) the finance costs relating to the following capital structure (the “New Capital Structure”) assuming that it was in place on October 1, 2018: - £1,223 million in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes, assuming that they were issued on October 1, 2018 and remained outstanding in full for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. For the purposes of deriving the finance costs for the Notes, we have assumed a blended interest rate per annum, resulting in aggregate interest expense of £97.1 million; - £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, based on their interest rate of 8.00% per annum, assuming they were issued on October 1, 2018 and remained outstanding for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, resulting in aggregate interest expense of £40 million; - £180 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Term Facilities, based on an assumed interest rate of 5.65% per annum, assuming that the Senior Term Facilities were fully drawn on October 1, 2018 and remained fully drawn for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, resulting in aggregate interest expense of £10 million; - £400 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Facility, based on an assumed interest rate of 8.87% per annum, assuming that the Second Lien Facility was fully drawn on October 1, 2018 and remained fully drawn for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, resulting in aggregate interest expense of £35.5 million; - incremental finance costs we would have incurred in the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 in respect of the new Revolving Facilities, assuming that we had the same borrowing profile in respect of our revolving facilities following the completion of the Transactions as Stonegate Group and Ei Group actually had for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively, but based on an assumed blended interest rate of 3.35%, resulting in incremental finance costs of £0.8 million; - an estimated £9.8 million in debt issue costs for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, representing a straight-line amortization of debt issue costs relating to the New Capital Structure described above (assuming total debt issue costs of £57.3 million and amortization over the period of the relevant debt); (B) the elimination of £122.9 million in finance costs relating to the old capital structure of Stonegate Group and Ei Group that was repaid in connection with the Transaction, including (i) Stonegate Group’s old senior secured notes and old revolving credit facility and (ii) the Ei Secured Corporate Bonds and Ei Unsecured Corporate Bonds, in each case, as though these debt instruments had been repaid in full on October 1, 2018; and (C) £8 million in write off of unamortized debt issue costs relating to Ei Group’s old capital structure, which we would have written off had we repaid this debt on October 1, 2018, resulting in an increase in finance costs for that amount. (4) the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement information for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 does not take into account any adjustments other than those set forth in the table above, including, for example, exceptional costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction that we would normally recognize under operating costs. 97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Its Managed Operations division consisted of 62 pubs as of December 28, 2019 operating under the Bermondsey Pub Company format (covering fully-managed pubs operating nationally with a drink-led retail offering) and 357 pubs as of December 28, 2019 under the Craft Union Pub Company format (covering generally smaller operations run by self-employed operators with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but no food offering). Its Managed Investments division consisted of 75 pubs as of December 28, 2019, operated as joint ventures with experienced retail partners reflecting a broad mix of operating styles. - _Ei Group Commercial Properties: Under this segment, Ei Group had a portfolio of 147 assets as of December 28, 2019, which it operated on a ‘free-of-tie’ basis. The assets in the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment contributed to the diversification of Ei Group’s earnings profile and provided additional recurring rental income.

Prior to the Transaction, Stonegate Group was the fourth largest managed pub company in the United Kingdom based on number of sites, trading from 760 sites across the United Kingdom as of January 19, 2020. Stonegate Group Property Asset Value was estimated to be £798 million as of September 19, 2019 and its estate included 251 freehold properties as of that date. Stonegate Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 were £853 million, £19 million and £24 million, respectively.

Its branded pubs consist of Be at One, Slug and Lettuce and Venues brands, while its unbranded pubs consist of Proper Pubs, Town Pub and Kitchen, Common Rooms, Classic Inns pubs and City Taverns. By operating its 105 ----- business through a multi-format strategy, Stonegate Group has successfully positioned itself to attract a wide customer demographic while being able to cater to various consumer trends. This diversity in formats and offerings allows it to exist in multiple sites across city and town centers without adversely affecting sales at its pubs in adjacent locations, as opposed to single format operators.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2319,STONEGATE GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2319.1,Overview,2319.1.3,Combined Group,"We believe that the Transaction results in a more resilient business for the combined group due to the combined group’s diversified operating models comprising publican partnerships, managed pubs and commercial properties, significant asset backing, strong purchasing power based on larger scale, all of which is complemented by Stonegate Group’s ability to deliver a market-leading operating performance across the Ei Group’s managed estate and publican partnership sites with the potential for conversion to Stonegate Group’s managed formats. The combined group has three main segments: - Publican Partnerships: Publican partnerships form a core operating segment of the combined group, made up of pubs owned or leased by the combined group and operated by publicans as their own businesses. A key feature of the publican partnerships operating model is “tie” arrangements, whereby most publicans have agreed under their lease or tenancy agreements to purchase beer and other beverages through us. We intend to continue to maintain these tie arrangements which, along with rental income, provide resilient and recurring earnings. - Managed Pubs: Managed pubs are largely managed and operated by the combined group and derive their income predominantly from the retail sale of food and drinks, accommodation and gaming machines. The exception being pubs operated under the Craft Union Pub Company format, which are generally smaller operations managed and operated by self-employed operators under our guidelines for managed pub operations, with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but no food offering. Our managed pubs are strategically positioned to cater to different customer demographics and price points. Stonegate Group’s managed estate forms the majority of the combined group’s portfolio of managed pubs. - Commercial Properties: Commercial properties consist of free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties operated and managed by third-party leaseholders. Commercial properties derive their income predominantly from rental payments and contribute to the diversification of earnings by providing another source of recurring rental income. From time to time, we expect to be able to monetize the value created in commercial properties at attractive multiples.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2319,STONEGATE GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2319.1,Overview,2319.1.4,,"On March 3, 2020, we completed the Transaction and Ei Group was combined with Stonegate Group. Following the Transaction, on a combined basis, we are the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites (4,749 sites on a combined basis as of April 12, 2020). The combined group has strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties (approximately 81% by number of sites and approximately 88% by value on a combined basis as of September 30, 2019) and a combined property asset value of approximately £4.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 (Stonegate Group: £798 million; Ei Group: £3.3 billion). The combined group is welldistributed through the United Kingdom, with a majority of pubs located at high street locations across London and the southeast region of the United Kingdom, and has diverse operating models, formats and brands. Revenue of the combined group is generated from a variety of sources, including drink and food sales (87.6% of pro forma revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019) and rental income (8.6% of pro forma revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019). We believe that our diverse and agile business that delivers across operating models, formats and brands, led by Stonegate Group’s experienced and reputed management team, will be instrumental in driving revenue growth in the future. Stonegate Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 were £853 million, £19 million and £24 million, respectively, and Ei Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the year ended September 30, 2019 were £724 million, £247 million and £209 million, respectively. On a combined basis, Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, was £1,598 million. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) on a combined basis for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 would have been £494 million. We had strong strategic reasons to combine Stonegate Group and Ei Group. The Transaction adds Ei Group’s strong and stable publican partnership business to Stonegate Group’s leading managed pub business. It provides a significant pipeline of publican partnership pubs that we can convert into managed pubs where we identify value accretive opportunities. The scale of the combined operations presents numerous opportunities, including opportunities to realize significant cost savings through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group. This combination also gives us the ability to take advantage of value arbitrage opportunities that may not have been fully exploited by Ei Group before. The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on our industry and our business. It resulted in the UK government taking unprecedented steps to implement a national lockdown, restricting social gatherings and mandating closure of non-essential businesses, in each case, leading to 104 ----- business slowdowns and shutdowns. Pursuant to a directive of the UK government, our pubs closed for business on March 20, 2020 as part of national efforts to curb the spread of the disease. Our pubs reopened for business on July 4, 2020, and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 77% of our managed pubs subject to government guidance. Late night formats where dancing is a key part of the offer, pubs aimed at the student demographic and most of our Be At One pubs remain closed during this initial phase of reopening. As of July 19, 2020, we believe that our publicans had reopened an estimated 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate. While we have seen certain positive early results based on our first week of trading after reopening, the impact of COVID-19 on our industry and our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and cannot be accurately predicted at this time.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

During the period from March 20, 2020 to July 4, 2020, we recorded no revenue other than nominal rent revenue. We continue to provide rent concessions and other support to our publicans, which may also result in lower revenues compared to prior periods. As a result of this period of closure and the measures we continue to take to combat the impact of COVID-19, our financial results for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 have been materially impacted. In addition, we would expect this period of closure, or if there are future periods of closure mandated by the UK government, to have a material impact on our financial results for the 52 weeks ended September 27, 2020. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operation will differ in respect of the current year and for future periods when compared to the historical financial condition and results of operation presented in this discussion. In response to the closure of our pubs on March 20, 2020, we adopted swift measures to significantly reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of maximizing our liquidity position. For a discussion of the cost control measures that we implemented in response to COVID-19, our strategic options to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity going forward and our estimate of reopening costs and the expected economics upon reopening, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19.” 106 ----- The impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing and ability of vaccination and other treatments to combat COVID-19, the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending, the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return to preCOVID-19 levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Financial years are therefore generally 52 weeks long, with the occasional 53-week period to maintain our year-end to the Sunday nearest to the end of September each year, which for 2017, 2018 and 2019, financial year periods were September 24, 2017, September 30, 2018 and September 29, 2019, respectively. Our financial year accounting period for 2018 was 53 weeks, whereas for 2017 and 2019, it was 52 weeks. Consequently, the results for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 were positively impacted by an additional week’s trading relative to the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 and the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. In addition, the comparability of our interim financial results is impacted by the varying lengths of our trading quarters. Our first trading quarter of each 52-week financial year is made up of 16 weeks, while the remaining three trading quarters of our 52-week financial year are each made up of 12 weeks. By contrast, the last trading quarter of our 53-week financial year, such as 2018, is made up of 13 weeks. For that reason, our first trading quarter may not be comparable to any of our other three trading quarters as they contain a different number of weeks. Similarly, our last trading quarter for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, may not be comparable to any of our other three trading quarters. Our historical consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum reflect the trading of certain pubs that we acquired, disposed of and closed during the relevant period. Our financial results as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 include, and the succeeding financial periods will include, the results of Ei Group from and including March 3, 2020, the date on which we completed the Transaction. A discussion of our Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information that gives effect to the Transaction can be found under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” In addition, our financial results as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, and the succeeding financial periods, include the results of the Intertain pubs from December 7, 2016, the date on which we acquired Intertain, as well as the results of the JDW pubs, the Large Bars pubs, the Punch Taverns pubs and the Sports Bar & Grill pubs from their respective dates of acquisition. Our financial results as of and for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, and the succeeding financial periods, include the results of Be At One from July 23, 2018, the date on which we acquired Be At One, as well as the results of four pubs acquired pursuant to the First Novus Acquisitions, from the respective dates of each of their acquisition. Our financial results as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, and the succeeding financial periods, include the results of Fever Bars from January 22, 2019, the date on which we acquired Fever Bars, as well as the results of 11 pubs acquired pursuant to the First Novus Acquisitions and six pubs acquired pursuant to the Second Novus Acquisition, each from their respective dates of acquisition. Accordingly, because of the changes in the number of pubs in operation in, and during, any given year, our operating results for each of the periods presented are not directly comparable.

It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year commencing on or after that date. Stonegate Group’s first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS 16 began 107 ----- September 30, 2019. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 for the financial periods beginning September 30, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. Pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16, as of September 30, 2019, we recognized a right of use lease asset of £692 million (after adjustments for intangible assets, onerous lease provisions, lease prepayments and accrued lease expenses as of September 29, 2019) and a corresponding lease liability of £546 million. Upon the adoption of IFRS 16, operating lease intangibles of £150 million, lease incentives of £5 million, rent accruals of £4 million and lease prepayments of £11 million that we had previously recognized in respect of operating leases will not be recognized, and the relevant amounts will be factored into the measurement of the right of use asset. As of January 19, 2020, we recognized a right of use asset of £677 million and a corresponding lease liability of £542 million. As of April 12, 2020, we recognized a right of use asset of £953 million and a corresponding lease liability of £778 million. Pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16, we recognize lease liabilities under borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet. Under IFRS 16, right of use assets is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, replacing the previous requirement to recognize a provision for onerous lease contracts. However, as of the transition date, we relied on our assessment of onerous lease contracts under IAS 37 instead of performing an impairment review, and the right of use asset was adjusted for the onerous lease provision immediately before the transition date. The onerous lease provision as of September 29, 2019 was £10 million and we recognized an amount of £6 million as adjustment to the right of use assets. In addition, we recognized an amount of £1 million in opening retained earnings, which represents the excess onerous lease provision as a result of different discount rates being used in respect of the onerous lease provision compared to lease liability under IFRS 16 and £1 million was utilized towards overhead costs of onerous lease sites. The remaining provision of £2 million was held as a provision as it relates to non-rental elements of onerous lease. No significant impact is expected to our financial leases. Adjusted only for the implementation of IFRS 16, for the 52 weeks ending September 27, 2020, our Stonegate Group Pre-Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve as the depreciation expense pursuant to adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to be lower than the operating lease charge recorded pursuant to IAS 17. However, net finance costs are expected to be higher, such that our net profit before tax, as well as our net profit after tax, are expected to be materially lower compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis. We have determined that there will be no net cash flow impact on adoption of IFRS 16. However, the classification of cash flows will be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows, whereas under IFRS 16, the lease payments will be split between a principal portion and an interest portion such that they will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively. The change in presentation is expected to result in an improvement to operating cash flows, offset by a corresponding decline in cash flow from financing activities. As a result of the implementation of IFRS 16, the comparability of our results of operations presented in our financial statements commencing with the financial year 2020 will be limited relative to our historical financial statements for prior periods. For more information on the impact of IFRS 16 on our financial statements, see Note 1 of each of our consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 and our consolidated financial statement as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

We proactively manage the composition of our estate and pursue a strategy of selective and opportunistic acquisition whereby we seek to acquire high-quality pubs that complement our current offering. Our significant acquisitions during the periods under discussion below are: - _Punch Taverns (asset acquisition accounted for as an asset deal): On October 10, 2016, October 31, 2016, July 24, 2017 and September 18, 2017, we acquired in total six leasehold pubs from Punch Taverns; - _Intertain (share acquisition accounted for as a business combination): In December 2016, we acquired Intertain, which at the time owned and operated 30 pubs; - _Large Bars (share acquisition accounted for as a business combination): On April 21, 2017, we acquired three pubs pursuant to the acquisition of Large Bars; - _Faucet Inn (asset acquisition accounted for as an asset deal): On February 2, 2017, we agreed to acquire three pubs and certain other assets from the Faucet Inn Sellers and have since completed the acquisition of one freehold pub on February 16, 2017 and the acquisition of the two remaining leasehold pubs on May 22, 2017; - _2017 Ei Asset Acquisitions (asset acquisition accounted for as an asset deal): On June 26, 2017, July 17, 2017, August 22, 2017 and November 7, 2017, we acquired a total of four pubs from Ei Group; - _JDW (asset acquisition accounted for as an asset deal): On September 5, 2016, we agreed to acquire ten leasehold pubs from JDW and have since completed the acquisition of these pubs. Additionally, we acquired a further three leasehold pubs on April 26, 2017, July 26, 2017 and September 6, 2017, respectively; - _Sports Bar & Grill (share acquisition accounted for as a business combination): On September 13, 2017 we acquired five leasehold pubs pursuant to the acquisition of Sports Bar & Grill; - _Be At One (share acquisition accounted for as a business combination): On July 23, 2018, we acquired 33 premium specialist cocktail bars (and a lease of an office premises), pursuant to the Be At One Acquisition; - _First Novus Acquisitions (asset acquisition accounted for as an asset deal): On July 22, 2018, we agreed to acquire 15 pubs pursuant to the Fist Novus Acquisitions, of which we had completed four by September 30, 2018.

For the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, and the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, we disposed of 15 pubs, 24 pubs, 11 pubs and 23 pubs, respectively, to third parties, and closed down nil pubs, two pubs, nil pubs and one pub, respectively, in each of these periods. As agreed with the CMA in connection with the Transaction, we have undertaken to dispose of 42 sites to third parties, including 10 sites from Stonegate Group’s estate and 32 sites from Ei Group’s estate. We intend to complete the disposal of these sites by November 2020. 109 ----- Over the nine years since we began our trading operations with the acquisition of pubs from Mitchells & Butlers, we have grown our estate from 333 sites as of November 20, 2010 to 763 sites as of September 29, 2019. Our revenue has grown from £697 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to £853 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 mainly due to the trading impact of these acquisitions.

We identify priority investments through biannual estate reviews, and approve each project at multiple levels, before it can finally be approved at our senior management meetings. Proposed schemes are reviewed at the Managing Director executive committee chaired by our managing directors and the operations board chaired by our CEO before being authorized at our senior management meetings chaired by our chairman. Since we began trading, and through January 19, 2020, we have refurbished approximately 621 Stonegate Group pubs. We continue to invest in our estate, and for the 156-week period ended January 19, 2020, our Stonegate Group Return on Investment was 35.9%. Our investments made over the last three years are also presented at each senior management meeting for post-investment review. As of January 19, 2020, there were 124 Stonegate Group pubs that have not been invested in while we have been under TDR Capital’s ownership, and we believe this provides us with a strong pipeline of investment and growth opportunities. In addition, we plan to convert a number of leased and tenanted pubs from Ei Group’s estate to managed pubs. Ei Group’s leased and tenanted estate provides a large unmined pipeline for conversions with approximately 82% of its leased and tenanted estate becoming available for conversion within the next five years. We have integrated the pubs we acquired through our acquisition of Large Bars, Intertain, JDW, the Faucet Inn Sellers, Punch Taverns, 2017 Ei Asset Acquisitions, Sports Bar & Grill and the additional site we acquired on May 2, 2017, into, among others, our Venues, Proper Pubs, Common Rooms and Town Pub and Kitchen formats. In addition, we have integrated the pubs acquired pursuant to the First Novus Acquisitions and the Second Novus Acquisitions into, among others, our Slug & Lettuce, Be At One, City Taverns, Venues and Town Pub and Kitchen formats and in addition, we are now operating the pubs acquired pursuant to the Fever Bars Acquisition as part of our Venues format. In relation to the Transaction, we believe that a significant opportunity for value creation exists in the Craft Union community pubs model (quasi-managed/franchised platform). The key benefit of this model is that these pubs are run by self-employed operators who receive a fixed percentage of revenue generated in these pubs, thereby making site earnings less volatile. This is particularly beneficial for sites with lower revenues. 110 ----- Ei Group was successful in applying this model. We expect to drive further value by utilizing our knowledge and capabilities to support and improve the existing Craft Union sites and by potentially increasing the number of sites that are run based on this model. We believe that our ability to successfully identify ideal trading formats for the pubs we acquire, and to integrate and/or convert these pubs into those formats, has allowed us to consistently achieve like for like revenue growth. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity, our ability to make investments in our estate, including investments made to convert leased and tenanted pubs from Ei Group’s estate to our managed formats or to the Craft Union format, may be limited for some time. We currently intend to keep discretionary spending at a minimum, and until our cash reserves recover to desirable levels, we plan to make opportunistic capital expenditure through a careful and considered approach.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Examples of changes in consumer habits that have favorably impacted our financial performance include long-term growth in the eating-out market, an increase in on-trade consumption of spirits and wines at the expense of beer, focus on overall customer experience and an increase in popularity of pubs attracting women and families with children. On the other hand, if consumers’ spending patterns in respect to alcohol evolve in such a way that they purchase a higher proportion of their alcoholic drinks at supermarkets, offlicenses and other off-trade channels than has been the case in the past, particularly in light of consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, where more consumers than usual turned to these alternative sources to buy alcoholic drinks, we may experience a decline in our sales. See “Industry.” In addition, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers’ ability or desire to visit pubs may remain weak for a significant length of time, which may also result in a decline in our sales. Changes in consumer preferences and trends may continue to impact our financial results, particularly if we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to such changes by evolving our brands and offering adequately and in a timely fashion. Adverse changes in the general macroeconomic environment can also have an impact on our sales. The outlook for the UK economy is currently subject to significant uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead the United Kingdom into a prolonged period of economic downturn, recession or depression. Our business is also subject to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, disposable income, unemployment rates, taxes, consumer credit levels and house prices, which could all affect the level of consumer confidence and, in turn, impact the level of consumer spending on eating and drinking out and other leisure activities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

We believe that much of our cost structure is flexible and can be re-evaluated and restructured as need arises. Employment costs and drink and food costs are significant elements of our operating costs and accounted for 32.6% and 28.2%, respectively, of our operating costs for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. The chart below illustrates the breakdown of our operating costs for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019: 8.1% % of Drink and Food costs 28.2% % of Other costs 32.6% % of Employment costs % of Operating lease rentals 31.1% 111 ----- Employment costs constituted 32.6% of our operating costs for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, of which 15.0% constituted the cost of wages (which are a variable cost to us) and the remaining 17.6% constituted the cost of salaries (which are a fixed cost to us). Minimum wage legislation largely establishes our base compensation levels. In April 2016, the UK government announced the introduction of a National Living Wage, which replaced the national minimum wage for all working people aged 25 and over in the United Kingdom. The National Minimum Wage remained in place for all working people under the age of 25 who are at least school leaving age in the United Kingdom. In April 2019, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the United Kingdom to 18 was increased to £4.35 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 24 was increased to £6.15 per hour and £7.70 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 25 and over was increased to £8.21. In April 2020, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the United Kingdom to 18 was increased to £4.55 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 24 was increased to £6.45 per hour and £8.20 per hour, respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 25 and over was to increased to £8.72 per hour. Increases in employment costs, whether due to market conditions or increases in mandatory minimum wages or benefits, can have a material impact on our results of operations. Increases in employee turnover can also result in increased recruiting expenses and reduced efficiency through lost management time. Employment costs includes within it labor costs described below. In addition, for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 and the 16 weeks ended January 29, 2020, our labor costs, which represents our aggregate site labor costs only (and is a financial metric commonly used in our industry) were 24.7%, 24.4%, 23.8% and 23.4%, respectively, of revenue. We believe that we have the ability to manage our fixed and variable labor costs at different levels of sales volumes if it is required. Our results are also affected by the cost of supplies purchased from third parties. While a majority of our supply chain is UK based, we also seek to capitalize on opportunities to mitigate, where possible, foreign supply chain costs by switching to less expensive geographies. We purchase beer and other drink products from various suppliers. Our six leading drink suppliers during the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 are Heineken UK, Molson Coors (UK), Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited, Diageo, Coca-Cola European Partners and Budweiser Brewing Company. Our gross margins derived from beer and other drink products is affected by changes in the wholesale prices at which they are bought from brewers and suppliers and the corresponding changes in prices at which they are sold on to customers. Our Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) can also be impacted by duty escalators that may be applied by the government in the United Kingdom with respect to alcoholic drinks. See “Industry.” Our Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) is affected by the changes in prices at which food is bought, the corresponding changes in wholesale prices at which they are sold on to customers and the impact of our menu changes. A substantial majority of our food supply is distributed through one supplier who, in consultation with us, in turn sources our food supplies from other suppliers in the market. We entered into a new food supply contract with this supplier in February 2019. Favorable pricing terms under this new food supply contract have positively contributed to the Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. For a discussion on the changes in our Gross Margin for Drink (Ongoing) and Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) over the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, see “—Key Performance Measures—Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) and Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing).” In connection with the Transaction, we expect to, but cannot make any guarantee that we will, realize synergies of £80 million, relating to, among others, (i) certain procurement-related cost savings that we expect to achieve primarily by migrating to Ei Group’s more favorable pricing structures and by utilizing the scale of the combined operations to renegotiate drinks and food suppliers’ pricing terms, (ii) savings from optimizing site operations and (iii) savings from realizing certain head office synergies. These cost savings have been estimated relative to costs incurred by Stonegate Group and Ei Group on a combined basis for the financial year 2019. For further details of such synergies, see “Summary—Stonegate Group’s Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other Information.” We expect to benefit from such, and other, economies of scale as we continue to expand our operations, which we believe will continue to have a favorable impact on our overall supply costs. With respect to our property portfolio as of September 29, 2019, the majority of our leases have five-year rent review cycles. Weak rental markets outside of London give us a strong negotiating position in those markets. Our capital investment in the pubs we rent and efforts to extend lease terms have also historically helped us negotiate rent concessions from our landlords. For the period our pubs were temporarily closed 112 ----- due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent payments during the period of closure. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19.” We believe that we have the ability to manage our site costs at different levels of sales volumes if it is required, however, we have less flexibility to manage our operating lease rental expense, site overhead costs and central overhead costs at different levels of sales volumes. Costs related to our business rates are affected by government policy in effect from time to time. For example, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has provided a business rates holiday scheme for the 2020 to 2021 tax year, which means we pay no business rates for this duration. Our site costs (including costs associated with trading, utilities, door, live entertainment, consumables, promotions, staff expenses, Sky, house repairs, refuse and other site operating costs) were £40 million, £133 million and £43 million for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019, the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 and the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, respectively.

Our branded group is comprised of our Slug and Lettuce, Venues and Be At One pubs, while our unbranded group is comprised of our Proper Pubs, Town Pub and Kitchen, Common Rooms, Classic Inns pubs and City Taverns. As a result of our mix of brands, formats, target markets and offering, we are not dependent on any one brand or format to drive our sales growth and performance. For more information concerning revenue movements attributable to our specific formats, see “—Key Performance Measures—Like for Like Growth” and “—Results of Operations.” Our results of operations represent an aggregation of the differing performance and characteristics of each of our current formats. Typically, any marginal decrease in revenue for some of our brands and formats is offset by an increase in revenue of our other brands and formats.

See “Industry” and “Stonegate Group’s Business.” In addition, we are currently subject to a 113 ----- number of requirements mandated by the UK government in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to maintaining social distancing between customers and strict hygienic measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additional requirements may be imposed on us in the future. We are subject to the Working Time Regulations in the United Kingdom. As we employ a large number of our staff at the minimum wage, increases in the minimum wage may result in increases in our labor costs and, to the extent we are not able to pass through these labor cost increases to our customers, we may experience an adverse impact on our gross margins. Licensing authorities in the United Kingdom are authorized to impose a late-night levy on late-opening alcohol suppliers. Many of our pubs are open late and some are subject to these late-night levies. To the extent that individual licensing authorities decide to implement late-night levies or the government decides to increase the scope of these powers, we could experience an increase in our operating costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations impose costs and administrative burdens on us, as our managers are required to devote significant amounts of their time to managing and ensuring compliance with these requirements, which reduces the time they are able to dedicate to the running of the business. For risks related to changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather, especially during the summer months or over our peak trading periods such as the Christmas period, Easter, bank holidays and end-of-the-month salary weekends, or weekends in general, can have a negative effect on our revenue. Inclement weather during major sporting events can also affect our revenue due to lower footfall resulting from poor weather conditions. The absence of major sporting events, or the poor performance of a British team, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In particular, the cancellation or postponement of sporting events as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic or the holding of sporting events behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, could also lead to lower footfall in our pubs, and thereby a decline in our revenue.

Our decrease in revenue was partially offset by the consolidation of Ei Group’s revenue within our results for the period from March 3, 2020 to April 12, 2020 (£42 million), and higher sales during the Christmas season. _Other Income_ Beginning the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, we have started to recognize other income on our income statement. Our other income for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 consisted of government grants received by us under the Job Retention Scheme, which provided payroll support for our employees who were furloughed due to the temporary closure of our pubs in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. _Operating Costs_ Our operating costs for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 increased by £2 million, or 0.5%, from £409 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to £411 million, primarily due to the consolidation of Ei Group’s operating costs within our results for the period from March 3, 2020 to April 12, 2020, offset by the elimination of lease expenses of £35 million as operating costs pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16 and the temporary closure of our pubs from March 20, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a reduction in our operating costs for the period between March 20, 2020 and April 12, 2020. During this period, we also reduced our operating costs by implementing a number of cost control measures. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19.” _Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment_ Our depreciation, amortization and impairment for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 increased by £55 million, from £39 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to £94 million, primarily due to the recognition of depreciation of £33 million in respect of our operating leases pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16, the consolidation of Ei Group’s depreciation and amortization expense within our results for the period from March 3, 2020 to April 12, 2020, and the recognition of £24 million of impairment charges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We saw a decline in our revenues for the period from March 9, 2020 to March 19, 2020 because of reduced footfall at our pubs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other than nominal rent revenue, we did not record any revenue for the period from March 20, 2020 to April 12, 2020, when our pubs were temporarily closed. Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like) was 3.6% for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, primarily due to higher drink sales within our Slug & Lettuce, Town Pub and Kitchens and City Taverns formats, improvements stemming from capital investments made, as well as our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as the Christmas season and key sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup. Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like) was 2.1% for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, primarily due to higher drink sales at our Slug & Lettuce and Town Pub and Kitchens formats, improvements stemming from the capital investments made, as well as our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as Christmas for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This growth rate, which is relative to our performance for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, was impacted by higher sales for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 on account of the Football World Cup and prolonged periods of good weather experienced during that financial year, with similar events not having recurred during the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like) was 6.0% for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to higher drink sales at our Slug & Lettuce format, improvements stemming from the capital investments made, prolonged periods of good weather experienced during the summer of 2018, as well as our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as the Christmas season and key sporting events such as the Football World Cup, partially offset by a decline in our sales due to severe cold weather conditions experienced across the United Kingdom during parts of February and March 2018. Stonegate Group Drink Sales Growth (Like for Like) was 3.1% for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, primarily due to higher drink sales at our Slug and Lettuce and Classic Inns formats, driven by improvements stemming from the capital investments made at pubs operating in these formats, as well as our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as the Christmas season. 123 ----- _Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like) for our Last Three Financial Years, the 16 Weeks Ended January 19, 2020 and the 28 Weeks ended April 12, 2020_ Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like) was negative 15.0% for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like) was 1.1% for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, primarily due to food sales growth in our City Taverns, Classic Inns and Town Pub and Kitchens formats, partially offset by increased competition from food sales in pubs, bars and restaurants. Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like) was negative 0.5% for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, compared to 0.8% for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. This decline was primarily due to increased competition from food sales in pubs, bars and restaurants, partially offset by food sales growth at pubs operating in certain of our formats, including pubs operating in our Classic Inns, Common Room and Slug & Lettuce formats. Stonegate Group Food Sales Growth (Like for Like) was 0.8% for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, compared to negative 2.3% for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017. This growth was primarily due to stabilization of our competitive environment and food sales growth at pubs operating in certain of our formats, including pubs operating in our Proper Pubs, Slug & Lettuce and Common Room formats. _Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) for our Last Three Financial Years, the 16 Weeks Ended January 19, 2020 and the 28 Weeks Ended April 12, 2020_ Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) was negative 25.1% for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We saw a decline in our pub profits for the period from March 9, 2020 to March 19, 2020 because of reduced footfall at our pubs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and we did not record any profits for the period from March 20, 2020 to April 12, 2020, when our pubs were temporarily closed. Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) was 12.9% for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, primarily due to higher drink sales within our Slug & Lettuce, Town Pub and Kitchens and City Taverns formats, improvements stemming from capital investments made, as well as our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as the Christmas season and key sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup.

This growth rate, which is relative to our performance for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, was impacted by higher sales for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 on account of the Football World Cup and prolonged periods of good weather experienced during that financial year, with similar events not having recurred during the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. In addition, our continued use of our labor efficiency tool, first introduced in 2015, also positively contributed to the Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. Our labor efficiency tool allows us to tailor our staffing needs to more closely mirror consumer demand and footfall at each of our pubs throughout the day and during the year, thereby allowing us to mitigate headwinds associated with the cost of labor. This tool has been helpful in partially mitigating the impact of increases in the National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage. Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) was 7.4% for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to increased drinks sales growth, the continuing success of our capital investments in increasing our margins and our ability to capitalize on revenue generating periods such as the Christmas season and key sporting events during the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, such as the Football World Cup, partially offset by a decline in our sales due to severe cold weather conditions experienced across the United Kingdom during parts of February and March 2018. Stonegate Group Pub Profit Growth (Like for Like) was 2.5% for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, primarily due to increased drinks sales growth and the continuing success of our capital investments in increasing our margins. Relative to the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2016, Stonegate Group Pub Profit 124 ----- Growth (Like for Like) was lower during this period because of the absence of significant sporting or other major events during the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, unlike the 52 weeks ended September 25, 2016, which included the effects on results of, among others, the Rugby World Cup and the European Football Championships. _Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) for our Last Three Financial Years, the 16 Weeks Ended January 19, 2020 and for 28 Weeks Ended April 12, 2020_ Stonegate Group’s gross margin (ongoing), calculated as the sum of Stonegate Group’s drinks margin (ongoing), food margin (ongoing), machine margin (ongoing) and other margin (ongoing), was £187 million, £624 million and £208 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019, the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 and the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. Stonegate Group’s drinks margin (ongoing) represents revenue from drinks sales (excluding revenue from drinks sales at disposed sites) minus cost of the drinks purchased (excluding costs of drinks purchased at disposed sites). Stonegate Group’s food margin (ongoing) represents revenue from food sales (excluding revenue from food sales at disposed sites) minus cost of the food purchased (excluding costs of food purchased at disposed sites). Stonegate Group’s machine margin (ongoing) represents revenue from machines sales (excluding revenue from machine sales at disposed sites) minus costs associated with the operation of machines (excluding costs associated with the operation of machines at disposed sites). Stonegate Group’s other margin (ongoing) represents revenue from other sources such as door income, accommodation income, income from room hire (excluding such revenue from disposed sites) minus central overhead costs such as head office costs. Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) was negative 8.1% for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis that occurred a week apart in February 2020 and fell over weekends in both instances. Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) was 5.1% for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, primarily due to higher drink sales margins driven by sales at our Slug & Lettuce, Town Pub and Kitchens and City Taverns formats, higher food sales margins resulting from more favorable pricing terms under our new food supply contract, our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as the Christmas season and key sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup and the implementation of our revised discounting strategy. Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) was 3.5% for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, primarily due to higher drink sales margins driven by sales at our Slug & Lettuce and Town Pub and Kitchens formats, higher food sales margins resulting from more favorable pricing terms under our new food supply contract, our ability to capitalize on key revenue generating periods such as Christmas and the implementation of our revised discounting strategy. In addition, a freeze in the duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders announced in the October 2018 budget also positively contributed to the Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019.

Stonegate Group Gross Margin Growth (Like for Like) was 2.6% for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, primarily due to higher drinks and food sales margins resulting from pricing initiatives that have allowed us to better analyze product performance at our pubs and to analyze and respond to changes in consumer trends in respect of our menu offerings resulting in enhanced food margins.

Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) and Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) in a particular period are sensitive to the macroeconomic environment, levels of competitor discounts, wholesale prices and retail prices and our ability to pass any increases on to our customers, as well as our ability to realize cost synergies based on acquisitions of pubs that we complete. Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) and Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) were lower than expected due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) and Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Food (Ongoing) have benefitted from the implementation of our revised discounting strategy and pricing initiatives discussed above. In particular, the Stonegate Group Gross Margin for Drinks (Ongoing) has benefitted during the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 from the higher emphasis in our drinks offering on premium, higher-value products, especially premium spirits.

This increase was partially offset by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the occurrence of Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis a week apart in February 2020 that fell over weekends in both instances.

Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 increased to £134 million from £112 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 increased to 15.7% from 14.7% for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to higher margins achieved on our drink sales and food sales, as well as efficiencies resulting from our labor management program which provides for effective deployment of labor in our sites, among others things, based on sales projection, which was partially offset by higher costs relating to increases in the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage.

Where a pub has traded for less than 52 weeks post-investment, we have not taken it into account when calculating the Stonegate Group Return on Investment. Pubs where we have not made a Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure in the past 156 weeks are classed as uninvested. Stonegate Group Return on Investment for the 156 weeks ended April 12, 2020, includes only Stonegate Group managed pubs and does not include the pubs of Ei or its subsidiaries.

Stonegate Group Cash Conversion (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 decreased to 62.1% from 75.0% for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) from £68 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to £58 million for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 and an increase in Stonegate Group Maintenance Capital from £17 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to £22 million for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. Stonegate Group Cash Conversion for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 increased to 80.0% from 64.1% for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019, primarily due to the impact to IFRS 16, as a result of which Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA increased by £19 million. Stonegate Group Cash Conversion (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020 increased to 71.7% from 64.1% for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019, primarily due to an increase in the Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) from £39 million for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 to £46 million for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. Stonegate Group Cash Conversion for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 increased to 72.8% from 67.2% for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA from £112 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 (but presented on a 52week basis for comparability) to £134 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. Stonegate Group Cash Conversion for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 (but presented on a 52week basis for comparability) increased to 67.2% from 66.5% for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the Stonegate Group Adjusted EBITDA from £103 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to £112 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 (but presented on a 52-week basis for comparability). 128 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2319,STONEGATE GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2319.34,Liquidity and Capital Resources,2319.34.1,Liquidity,"We have significant debt service obligations. As of April 12, 2020, after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had total third-party debt of £3,178 million (excluding a lease liability of £778 million as of April 12, 2020 calculated in accordance with IFRS 16). As of April 12, 2020, our Revolving Facilities were drawn in an amount of £200.0 million. Effective July 13, 2020, the committed financing under the Revolving Facilities Agreement was increased to £250 million (the additional £50 million of committed capital available for a 23-month period). See “Capitalization.” 129 ----- For a description of our current liquidity position, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Liquidity Update.” As a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of our pubs for the period from March 20, 2020 to July 4, 2020, we expect our cash flow from operations to be significantly lower than in the past for the third quarter of 2020 and the financial year 2020, and potentially for other future periods. In response to the closure of our pubs on March 20, 2020, we adopted swift measures to significantly reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of maximizing our liquidity position. For a discussion of the cost control measures that we implemented in response to COVID-19, our strategic options to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity going forward and our estimate of reopening costs and the economics upon reopening, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19.” We depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our operating activities, supply capital to finance our operations and growth, make capital expenditure and manage our debt levels. The continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and could adversely affect our ability to make future interest and other payments with respect to our indebtedness and other obligations. While we have taken several steps to preserve capital, increase liquidity and improve efficiency, described under “Summary—Recent Developments—Liquidity Update,” our short-term liquidity needs are still significant, including funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures, including certain payroll and related benefits, fixed costs associated with the operation of our pubs, interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our pubs (to the extent not deferred) and corporate general and administrative expenses. Since we generally are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our pubs decreases, any resulting decline in our revenues and cash flows, particularly in the event of a future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a greater adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. The Indenture governing the New Notes offered hereby, the Senior Secured Term Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Revolving Facilities Agreement, as well as the trust deeds governing the Unique Securitized Notes, contain covenants significantly restricting our ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Parent; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain investments; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Parent or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities; - consolidate or merge with other entities; - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and - amend certain documents. Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs. As discussed above, our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our operating cash flow. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we have access to the Revolving Facilities to service our working capital and general corporate needs. The availability of this facility is dependent upon conditions, including compliance with financial covenants relating to our consolidated leverage ratio and other covenants as described further under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Facilities 130 ----- Agreement.” Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry or the UK economy as a whole; - a reduction in operating cash flows due to prolonged periods of closure or restrictions in the operations of our pubs due to COVID-19 or other health emergencies; - inability to access capital; - adverse working capital developments; - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to that portion of our borrowings which bears interest at a variable rate; and - any need to fund higher than anticipated capital expenditures. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under our Revolving Facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - reduce or delay our planned acquisitions; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the application of the proceeds therefrom, including the Notes, the Senior Secured Term Facilities, the Second Lien Facility, the Revolving Facilities and the Unique Securitized Notes, limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you.

The impact of the adjustment for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 is an increase in net cash flow from operating activities (due to a decrease in “Changes in receivables”) by £6 million and an increase in net cash outflow from investing activities (“Loan made to ultimate parent company”) by £6 million. We expect to make the same adjustment for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 when we prepare our annual report and consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52 weeks ended September 27, 2020 and, accordingly, we have reflected that adjustment in the table above. _Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities_ Our net cash flow from operating activities decreased by £21 million, from a net cash inflow of £52 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to a net cash inflow of £31 million for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the temporary closure of our pubs from March 20, 2020 pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in our cash flow from operating activities due to Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis, which were both powerful and long-lived extratropical cyclones that occurred a week apart in February 2020 and fell over weekends in both instances. This decrease was partially offset by the consolidation of Ei Group’s net cash flow from operating activities within our results for the period from March 3, 2020 to April 12, 2020 (£7 million) and the application of IFRS 16 pursuant to which the principal portion of our operating leases of £23 million was reclassified from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from financing activities. This decrease was also partially due to the reclassification of a loan to Stonegate Holdings, the indirect parent company of the Parent, from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from investing activities for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019, which resulted in an increase in net cash flow from operating activities (due to a decrease in “Changes in receivables”) by £6 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019. Our net cash flow from operating activities increased by £30 million, from a net cash inflow of £15 million for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 to a net cash inflow of £45 million for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the application of IFRS 16 pursuant to which the principal portion of our operating leases of £17 million was reclassified from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from financing activities. In addition, our operating cash flow for the prior comparable period was impacted by payment of discretionary management bonuses to certain of our senior managers during the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 under our prior management incentive program with no such payments being made during the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. Our net cash flow from operating activities increased by £12 million, from a net cash inflow of £53 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 to a net cash inflow of £65 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact on our working capital requirements on account of there being one less week, as well as the period end date being prior to a quarter/month end date, in the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 compared to the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. Typically, we pay rent expenses at the end of each quarter and supplier payments at the end of each month. During the prior comparable period of the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018, which contained one additional quarter- and month-end date compared to the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, we paid rent expenses for one additional quarter and supplier payments for one additional month compared to the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This resulted in higher working capital requirements for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and a consequent increase in our net cash flow from operating activities for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This increase was also due to the reclassification of a loan to Stonegate Holdings, the indirect parent company of the Parent, from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from investing activities for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, which resulted in an increase in net cash flow from operating activities (due to a decrease in “Changes in receivables”) by £6 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. Our net cash flow from operating activities increased by £6 million, from a net cash inflow of £47 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to a net cash inflow of £53 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. The increase primarily resulted from improved trading performance at our pubs and an additional week of trading during the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. _Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities_ Our net cash flow from investing activities increased by £1,045 million, from a net cash outflow of £106 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to a net cash outflow of £1,151 million for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the payments made during the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020 to finance the Transaction. Our net cash flow from investing activities decreased by £24 million, from a net cash outflow of £48 million for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 to a net cash outflow of £24 million for the 16 weeks ended 132 ----- January 19, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to payments made during the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 to acquire Fever Bars with no similar payments made during the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. Our net cash flow from investing activities increased by £16 million, from a net cash outflow of £125 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 to a net cash outflow of £141 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This increase primarily resulted from payments made to acquire pubs pursuant to the Fever Bars Acquisition, the First Novus Acquisitions and the Second Novus Acquisitions as well as a reduction in sale proceeds due to fewer pub disposals during the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This increase was also due to the reclassification of a loan to Stonegate Holdings, the indirect parent company of the Parent, from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from investing activities for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, which resulted in an increase in net cash outflow from investing activities (“Loan made to ultimate parent company”) by £6 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. Our net cash flow from investing activities decreased by £13 million, from a net cash outflow of £138 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to a net cash outflow of £125 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. This decrease resulted from higher expenditures on acquired pubs for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 (Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure of £48 million in the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017), compared to the capital expenditure on acquired pubs during the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 (Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure of £35 million in the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018). _Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities_ Our net cash flow from financing activities increased by £1,357 million, from a net cash inflow of £48 million for the 28 weeks ended April 14, 2019 to a net cash inflow of £1,405 million for the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the financing of the Transaction, consisting of the proceeds received pursuant to the share issuance to Midco and borrowings under the Senior Bridge Facilities Agreement, Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, offset by the repayment of certain debt in connection with the Transaction. Our net cash flow from financing activities decreased by £31 million, from a net cash inflow of £12 million for the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 to a net cash outflow of £19 million for the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the application of IFRS 16 pursuant to which the principal portion of our operating leases of £17 million was reclassified from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from financing activities. In addition, we received £15 million in proceeds pursuant to a share issuance to Midco during the 16 weeks ended January 20, 2019 with no similar cash inflow received during the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020. Our net cash flow from financing activities decreased by £14 million, from a net cash inflow of £83 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 to a net cash inflow of £69 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the borrowings made under a senior secured bridge facility agreement entered into by us in July 2018 to initially finance the Be At One Acquisition, the First Novus Acquisitions, the Fever Bars Acquisition and the Second Novus Acquisitions with the proceeds of the offering of £150 million in aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes issued by us in February 2019, partially offset by £15 million of share issuance proceeds received pursuant to a share issuance by the Parent to Midco in December 2018. Our net cash flow from financing activities increased by £18 million, from a net cash inflow of £65 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to a net cash inflow of £84 million for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. This change was primarily due to our borrowings made under our old revolving credit facility during the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 (£69 million as of September 30, 2018 compared to nil as of September 24, 2017). 133 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

For a discussion regarding capital expenditure made by Ei Group during the period from December 29, 2019 to March 2, 2020, see “Ei Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Ei Group Capital Expenditure.” Stonegate Group’s capital expenditures have primarily been made in relation to the acquisition of trading sites, real estate refurbishments and upgrades, the integration of our newly acquired pubs into our existing brands and formats, the refurbishment of newly acquired pubs and investment in IT infrastructure. Excluding Stonegate Group Acquisition Capital Expenditure, capital expenditure increased to 9.7% of revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 compared to 9.2% of revenue for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. Stonegate Group Maintenance Capital Expenditure during the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 was primarily driven by maintenance capital expenditure in relation to certain business projects improvements across our estate such as the integration of machines that process card payments at our pubs with our cash registers and certain IT enhancement projects. During the 28 weeks ended April 12, 2020, Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure was made at 74 sites which included 27 pubs in our Proper Pubs format and 10 pubs in our Be At One format. These investment were made prior to the temporary closure of our pubs on March 20, 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. During the 16 weeks ended January 19, 2020, Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure was made at 40 sites which included investments in 5 pubs acquired pursuant to the Be At One Acquisition, 5 pubs in our Town Pub and Kitchen format and 3 pubs in our Slug & Lettuce format. During the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure was made at 140 sites which included investments in, five pubs acquired pursuant to the Fever Bars Acquisition, ten pubs acquired pursuant to the First Novus Acquisition, three pubs acquired pursuant to the Second Novus Acquisition, and within our Proper Pubs format and 36 pubs and within our Venues format 23 pubs. For the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, 33.1% of capital expenditure constituted of Stonegate Group Investment Capital Expenditure, 26.0% of capital expenditure constituted of Stonegate Group Maintenance Capital Expenditure and 41.0% of capital expenditure constituted of Stonegate Group Acquisition Capital Expenditure. 134 ----- Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity, our ability to make capital expenditures may be limited for some time. Currently, we intend to keep discretionary spending at a minimum, and until our cash reserves recover to desirable levels, we plan to make capital expenditure through a careful and considered approach. In terms of investment capital expenditure, we plan to complete the projects that we had started prior to the closure of our pubs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In relation to our publican partnership pubs, we also intend to complete investments in pubs where we had agreed with tenants to do so and in pubs that we have taken back, or agreed to take back, from tenants in the ordinary course. Based on our current estimates, we expect to make investment capital expenditures of approximately £20 million for the period between April 2020 and September 2020. In terms of maintenance capital expenditure, for the months of July and August 2020, we intend to make business critical maintenance capital expenditures only. Based on our current estimates, from September to January 2020, we expect to get to 75%-85% of our normal maintenance capital expenditure levels and for the period July 2020 to June 2021, we expect to spend approximately £60 million on maintenance capital expenditure. In light of the impact of COVID-19 and resulting uncertainties, the estimates provided above are subject to ongoing review and may change based on how circumstances evolve over time. In addition, these estimates may change based on changes to our business plan as we continue to evaluate our strategies in relation to the Transaction.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2320,EI GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2320.1,Overview,2320.1.1,,"Ei Group has three reportable segments: Ei Group Publican Partnerships, Ei Group Managed Pubs and Ei Group Commercial Properties. Ei Group Publican Partnerships represents its leased and tenanted business. Ei Group Managed Pubs includes its Managed Operations that are 100% owned by Ei Group and Managed Investments that are joint ventures with experienced retail partners. Ei Group Commercial Properties represents its free-of-tie and non-pub property business. The Ei Group Publican Partnerships business has been Ei Group’s core operation for the periods under review below, generating 67.3% of Ei Group’s revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 and 63.2% of Ei Group’s revenue for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019. Ei Group Publican Partnerships’ trading performance has been maintained for six consecutive financial years, driven by the deployment of capital into growth opportunities across the estate and the provision of a substantial range of services and support to its publicans. The fastest growing part of Ei Group’s business is Ei Group Managed Pubs. Ei Group had 494 managed pubs as of December 28, 2019 (compared to 392 managed pubs as of December 29, 2018). Ei Group has transferred in the region of 100 to 120 pubs a year to its managed pubs segment from its Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment, usually supported by significant investment in the pub, delivering increased diversity and scale of earnings. As Ei Group has become a more accomplished managed house operator with greater operational knowledge and capability, it has been able to bring more examples of best practices to its leased and tenanted pub business, as well as to utilize its purchasing scale to greater effect to help its publicans increase their sales and reduce their costs. Between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2018, Ei Group had substantially grown its commercial properties business, primarily through the transfer of pubs from its tied Ei Group Publican Partnerships business to pubs operating on free-of-tie agreements, including those which have elected to take up the Market Rent Only (MRO) option under the Pubs Code. This has enabled them to monetize these assets through the disposal of many of them.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The comparability of the results for the periods under review is therefore impacted by disposals as well as the reallocation of pubs among segments.

It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year commencing on or after that date. Ei Group’s first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS 16 began on October 1, 2019. Accordingly, Ei Group has applied IFRS 16 beginning the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. On the adoption of IFRS 16, Ei Group recognized a right of use asset of £211 million and a financial asset of £9 million (including the existing intangible operating lease premium asset of £8 million) with a corresponding lease liability of £281 million. The right of use asset is net of an impairment provision based on an impairment test carried out on adoption. In addition, a balance of £5 million in prepayments in relation to lease payments made immediately prior to adoption was released along with the existing onerous lease provision of £6 million and an overdue rent review provision of £5 million. The net balance of £59 million was recognized in the opening profit and loss reserve. The deferred tax effect of the above balance recognized in the opening profit and loss reserve was £10 million. Ei Group has determined that there will be no net cash impact of the adoption of IFRS 16, however, the standard prescribes that where operating lease payments were previously categorized as operating cash flows, the payments will be split between the principal portion and the interest element with both to be presented within cash flows from financing activities. The change in presentation is expected to result in an improvement to operating cash flows of £21 million for the financial year ending September 30, 2020, the corresponding decrease being in financing cash flows. For more information on the impact of IFRS 16 on Ei Group’s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Ei Group’s interim financial statements as of and for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 and Note 2 of Ei Group’s financial statement as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2320,EI GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2320.3,Key Factors Affecting Ei Group’s Results of Operations,2320.3.1,Repositioning of Ei Group’s Portfolio,"In May 2015, Ei Group outlined the results of a fundamental strategic review with the aim of optimizing Ei Group’s returns from every asset within its property portfolio. In order to achieve this, Ei Group established a strategy to increase its operational flexibility by: - continuing to strengthen its tied leased and tenanted business, which was to remain the core of its business; - establishing and expanding the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment; - building a high quality Ei Group Commercial Properties portfolio; and - disposing of assets when and where appropriate to optimize returns. Pursuant to this strategy, Ei Group built the infrastructure necessary to facilitate the evolution of its estate from a predominantly leased and tenanted operation to a diversified portfolio of business models. During the periods under review, as part of the implementation of this strategy, it has established and grown the Ei Group Managed Pubs and Ei Group Commercial Properties businesses and has disposed of a number of underperforming Ei Group Publican Partnership pubs. In addition, Ei Group has grown the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment by converting, and investing in, assets previously operated within Ei Group’s leased and tenanted business. The conversion of pubs from those operated under Ei Group Publican Partnerships to Ei Group Managed Pubs or Ei Group Commercial Properties impacts Ei Group’s revenue and cost structure. The revenue for Ei Group Publican Partnerships is primarily derived from rent paid by publicans and the supply of drinks to publicans. The main costs for Ei Group Publican Partnerships are costs for the purchase of drinks supplied to publicans and property costs, including repairs and maintenance and leasehold rents payable to landlords for Ei Group pubs held under operating or finance leases. The revenue for Ei Group Managed Pubs is primarily derived from the sale of drinks and some food to retail customers. When Ei Group converts pubs from Ei Group Publican Partnerships to Ei Group 139 ----- Managed Pubs, the revenue and EBITDA derived from these pubs increases, as it receives the full value of the retail sales. Correspondingly, operating costs also increase due to staff costs and other costs associated with running the Ei Group Managed Pubs (such as utilities), which are not applicable for pubs it operates under Ei Group Publican Partnerships. As a result, the Underlying EBITDA Margin for Ei Group Managed Pubs is generally lower than the Underlying EBITDA Margin for Ei Group Publican Partnerships. Therefore, the relative increase in the number of pubs under Ei Group Managed Pubs during the periods under review has resulted in an increase in revenue and EBITDA of the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment, on the one hand, and a decrease in the Underlying EBITDA Margin for Ei Group Managed Pubs, on the other hand. Ei Group’s revenue for Ei Group Commercial Properties is derived from rent, while the operating costs incurred by this segment are limited. When pubs under Ei Group Publican Partnerships are moved to Ei Group Commercial Properties, Ei Group generally seeks to negotiate a higher free-of-tie rental income. While Ei Group loses the income received from the drinks supplied to tied publicans, the Ei Group EBITDA Margin increases as it does not incur costs related to the sale of drink and food and the Underlying EBITDA Margin for Ei Group Commercial Properties is 100%.

Disposals were primarily focused on underperforming, overlapping and ready-to-be-sold assets. Ei Group has also opportunistically disposed of well-performing non-core commercial properties where it believed that doing so would maximize value. For example, during the year ended September 30, 2019, Ei Group disposed of 354 properties under its Ei Group Commercial Properties segment and 129 assets in the ordinary course. During the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019, Ei Group disposed of 224 pubs, 174 pubs, 483 properties (including 354 properties under its Ei Group Commercial Properties segment), 18 pubs and 14 pubs, respectively, to third parties. Ei Group reinvests part of its net disposal proceeds into capital investment in the estate. Disposal proceeds for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019, were £100 million, £66 million, £384 million, £3 million and £4 million, respectively, which helped fund Ei Group’s capital expenditure of £80 million, £81 million, £87 million, £19 million and £23 million, respectively, for these periods. Approximately 60%, 60%, 58%, 71% and 69% of capital expenditure during the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 28, 2019, respectively, were directed toward income growth opportunities. In addition to disposals, leases or tenancies may prematurely terminate or not be renewed upon expiration (business failures). Over the last few years, Ei Group has experienced a decline in unplanned business failures. Unplanned business failures, which Ei Group believes have a greater impact on its business as it is less able to mitigate their impact, have remained constant, totaling 82 pubs for the year ended September 30, 2019 (compared to 83 pubs for the year ended September 30, 2018) and 14 pubs for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 (compared to 22 pubs for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018). Where possible, the pub will be re-let immediately to another lessee or tenant. Where this is not possible, the pub may remain closed until a new partner is found to operate the pub. 140 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth has been maintained through the performance of publicans, supplemented by Ei Group’s business enhancing support and efforts to invest capital alongside the best publicans to improve trading performance by enhancing the retail offer. For the year ended September 30, 2019, Ei Group invested £14 million (compared to £19 million in 2018 and £20 million in 2017) in growth-orientated schemes across 330 tied agreements (compared to 322 in 2018 and 351 in 2017) and delivered an average pre-tax return on investment of 20% (compared to 19% in 2018 and 21% in 2017). Ei Group has historically provided its tied leased and tenanted publicans with a broad range of services to help them increase sales and reduce costs, and to operate their pubs efficiently and effectively. Growth of the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment provided additional insight, experience and best practices, all of which Ei Group has utilized to further enhance the support that can be provided to tied publicans in the Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment. Ei Group has now published a total of 32 Pub Principle Guides, including such business areas as product range, pricing, social media and GDPR-compliance, and its successful “eilive” roadshows saw an increase in the number of publicans attending year on year. In the year ended September 30, 2018, Ei Group launched a new online ordering platform, and almost two-thirds of its publicans now order a proportion of their weekly drinks requirement using this service. Ei Group’s ability to assist publicans during periods of economic challenge has helped prevent business failures. Despite external pressures such as rising input costs and the disproportionate burden of business rates, there has been no material change in the number of unexpected business failures with 82, or 2.0% of the estate (compared to 83, or 1.8% of the estate in 2018 and 61, or 1.3% of the estate in 2017) suffering such failure for the year ended September 30, 2019. Where appropriate, Ei Group provides direct financial assistance to tied publicans and this cost has remained stable at £4 million during the year ended September 30, 2019 (compared to £4 million in 2018 and £4 million in 2017). The extent of business failures and the need to provide support to publicans from time to time tends to affect the level of Ei Group’s rental income. For example, if publicans experience low sales volumes for extended periods of time, they may not be able to pay rent at the levels agreed or at all, which could reduce Ei Group’s rental income.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group’s underlying finance costs for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were £149 million, £146 million and £137 million, respectively. Underlying finance costs exclude costs related to refinancing transactions that it completed during the relevant period. Such costs are recognized as non-underlying because Ei Group’s refinancing activity is not representative of its underlying trading performance. See “—Non-underlying items.” Ei Group had outstanding nominal debt of £1,878 million as of December 28, 2019 (excluding a lease liability of £283 million calculated in accordance with IFRS 16), as compared to £1.9 billion as of September 30, 2019, £2.2 billion as of September 30, 2018 and £2.3 billion as of September 30, 2017. Ei Group has raised cash primarily through the issuance of Ei Corporate Bonds with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2031 and Unique Securitized Notes with maturities ranging to 2032. In connection with the Transaction, we have redeemed the Ei Corporate Bonds (together with any accrued and unpaid interest and any redemption premium) in their entirety, as well as repaid in full the outstanding borrowings under the Ei Group Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The indebtedness owed under the Unique Securitized Notes has been rolled over. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Unique Securitized Notes.” The indebtedness owed under the Unique Securitized Notes is required to be repaid in accordance with agreed amortization schedules up to and including the final maturity of the respective notes. During the periods under review, Ei Group repaid £77 million during the year ended September 30, 2017 as scheduled repayments, £81 million during the year ended September 30, 2018 as scheduled repayments, £51 million during the year ended September 30, 2019 as scheduled repayments and £5 million during the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 as scheduled repayments. The Unique Securitized Notes are scheduled to amortize over a period to 2032 and attract interest rates of between 5.7% and 7.4%.

For the year ended September 30, 2019, 76% of Ei Group’s revenue was derived from drink revenue, primarily beer, from the supply of drinks to publicans and retail sales of drinks in the Ei Group Managed Pubs. In recent years, demand for premium products, such as craft beers and ciders has increased. In the periods under review, Ei Group benefited from increased sales of premium products. Based on the latest market trend, Ei Group expects this shift toward premium products to continue. Although the volume of beer supplied or sold by Ei has remained steady in recent years, this has been largely driven by conversion of pubs from Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment to Ei Group Managed Pubs segment. Overall on-trade beer demand has decreased in recent years, as consumers are able to purchase beer at lower prices at off-license stores and supermarkets. However, the increase in demand for premium products helped offset this decline. Ei Group’s drink revenue increased from £514 million for the year ended September 30, 2018 to £549 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. Changes in the general macroeconomic environment and consumer confidence can also have an impact on Ei Group’s sales. The disposable income of consumers is a key factor for pub visits. As a result, Ei Group’s business is also subject to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, disposable income, unemployment rates, taxes, consumer credit levels and house prices, which could all affect the level of consumer confidence and, in turn, impact the level of consumer spending on eating and drinking out and other leisure activities. Ei Group’s financial results can be materially impacted by any change in consumer habits within the United Kingdom. Changes in consumer tastes and demographic trends may also affect the appeal of the pubs, especially if such changes are not identified and addressed by developing formats and offerings adequately and sufficiently promptly, which could have a negative impact on financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group’s cost structure for Ei Group Publican Partnerships mainly comprises the costs for the purchase of drinks supplied to publicans and property costs, which include repairs and maintenance and leasehold rents payable to landlords for Ei Group’s pubs held under operating or finance leases. Ei Group’s cost structure for Ei Group Managed Pubs mainly comprises drink and food costs, staff costs and other running costs. Drink and food costs are the largest element of Ei Group’s operating costs, which accounted for 58.3% of its underlying operating costs for the year ended September 30, 2019. The Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment accounts for most of the drink costs. Ei Group’s costs for beer and other drink products are affected by changes in the wholesale prices at which they are bought from brewers and suppliers. The costs for drinks can also be impacted by duty escalators that may be applied by the government in the UK with respect to alcoholic drinks. For example, the government in the UK imposed a duty escalator which commenced in April 2009, pursuant to which duties on alcohol rose each year by 2% above the rate of inflation (based on retail price index, or RPI). Although the duty escalator was subsequently removed, such duties could be reintroduced and similar taxes and duties could be imposed by the government in the future. In the Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment, Ei Group has typically passed cost increases on to publicans. However, in the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment, Ei Group’s ability to pass on cost increases to its customers has been limited. Most of the beer supplied to Ei Group was purchased under supply agreements, typically for a duration of three years, with key suppliers. These agreements provide for an annual price review. Employment costs are another significant element of Ei Group’s operating costs. Ei Group employs staff to support the operations of all segments, as well as pub staff in Ei Group Managed Pubs (with the exception of the Craft Union division). Publicans in the Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment bear the employment costs of pub staff. Employment costs constituted 15.8% of Ei Group’s underlying operating costs for the year ended September 30, 2019, of which 25.4% constituted the cost of wages (which are a variable cost to Ei Group) and the remaining 74.6% constituted the cost of salaries (which are a fixed cost to Ei Group). The average number of employees has grown in the periods under review from 1,369 142 ----- average monthly employees during the year ended September 30, 2017, 1,872 average monthly employees during the year ended September 30, 2018, 2,180 average monthly employees during the year ended September 30, 2019. For the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, Ei Group’s labor costs were 7.9% 8.5%, 9.8% of revenue, respectively. Minimum wage legislation largely establishes Ei Group’s base compensation levels. Increases in employment costs, whether due to market conditions or increases in mandatory minimum wages or benefits, can have a material impact on Ei Group’s results of operations. See also, “—Regulation.” Increases in employee turnover can also result in increased recruiting expenses and reduced efficiency through lost management time. With respect to Ei Group’s property portfolio, it leases approximately 4% of its estate from landlords under operating leases and finance leases. The costs payable on the operating leases are recognized as an expense in Ei Group’s income statement. For the year ended September 30, 2019, operating leases accounted for 4.9% of Ei Group’s underlying operating costs. The majority of Ei Group’s leases have fiveyear rent review cycles.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Fluctuations in the property market are the primary cause of fluctuations in the value of Ei Group’s assets. The year ended September 30, 2016 was the first year in which Ei Group recorded an increase in the annual estate valuation since the financial year ended September 30, 2009, when the valuation of Ei Group’s estate decreased by 7% in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The valuation of the estate during the year ended September 30, 2017 increased by 0.2%, and there was no net movement in the total value of the estate for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2019. For the periods under review, Ei Group’s estate is held on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment, and investment property. Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value, and landlord’s fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. Valuations of licensed land and buildings recognized in property, plant and equipment are carried out on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year and each individual asset is separately valued. For pubs that are held in property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet, movements in the valuation of any individual asset are recognized in accordance with IAS 16, while movements in the valuation of individual assets held as investment property are recognized in accordance with IAS 40. Any revaluation that causes the book value of a property held in property, plant and equipment to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the income statement. If that same property later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the income statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognized. Any revaluation above book value is recognized in the revaluation reserve in the statement of comprehensive income, and if that same property later reduces in value, the decrease is debited to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a credit was previously recognized in relation to that asset. The revaluations from movements in relation to investment properties are recognized in the income statement. The transfer of assets to non-current assets held for sale can also result in write downs. Where properties identified for disposal are revalued immediately prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, the revaluation movement is recognized consistently with the accounting explained above dependent on the type of asset being transferred (i.e. property, plant and equipment or investment property). Therefore, even though the valuation of the entire estate as a whole may increase in a given period, write downs of certain assets within the estate may nonetheless result in charges being recognized in the income statement. For additional details, see Note 5(c) and Notes 16-18 to Ei Group’s financial statement for the year ended September 30, 2017, Note 5(c) and Notes 16-18 to Ei Group’s financial statement for year ended September 30, 2018 and Note 5(c) and Notes 15 to 17 to Ei Group’s financial statement for the year ended September 30, 2019, in each case, included elsewhere in the Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

See “Stonegate Group’s Business—Regulation.” 143 ----- The Pubs Code, introduced by the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, came into effect in July 2016 to regulate the relationship between tied pub tenants and the large pub-owning businesses, which rent the pubs to tenants and sell them tied products, and to establish a new independent Pubs Code adjudicator to enforce the code. It provides tied publicans with a right, under certain circumstances, to replace their existing freely-negotiated tied agreements with a new free-of-tie MRO arrangement. From the date of the introduction of the Pubs Code in July 2016 to September 30, 2019, there have been 1,662 rent review or agreement renewal events which could potentially have triggered an MRO request. As required under the Pubs Code, Ei Group issued 385 MRO offers in response to requests by tenants of which 213 have been concluded by way of mutually agreed tied deals and 52 have resulted in new mutually agreed free-of-tie terms. 1,048 pubs of the 1,662 pubs as of September 30, 2019 were still operated by the same publican on either tied or new free-of-tie agreements. Such pubs delivered like for like net income increase of 0.7% during the year ended September 30, 2019. The movement in Ei Group’s income for this group of pubs has not been as strong as the Ei Group Like for Like Net Income Growth of 1.2% achieved during the year ended September 30, 2019 for the Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment reflecting, in part, the stronger negotiating position for publicans which the Pubs Code set out to achieve. Ei Group has reduced the number of longer-term leases and increased the proportion of Ei Group’s tied business operating under shorter-term tenancy agreements of up to five years in length. Since the concept of MRO agreements was first announced in November 2014, Ei Group has reduced the number of longterm agreements from 3,035 at that time to 1,552 as of September 30, 2019. Increases in the National Minimum Wage and the National Living Wage may result in increases in Ei Group’s labor costs and, to the extent Ei Group is not able to pass through these labor cost increases to its customers, it may experience an adverse impact on its gross margins. Ei Group’s staff costs, which primarily include wages and salaries, have increased during the periods under review from £51 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to £71 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, reflecting the growth of the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment as part of the strategic repositioning of its business. Licensing authorities in the United Kingdom are authorized to impose a late-night levy on late-opening alcohol suppliers. Many of Ei Group’s pubs are open late and are subject to these late-night levies. To the extent that individual licensing authorities decide to implement late-night levies or the government decides to increase the scope of these powers, Ei Group could experience an increase in its operating costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes certain administrative burdens on Ei Group, as its managers are required to devote significant amounts of their time to managing and ensuring compliance with these requirements, which reduces the time they are able to dedicate to the running of the business. For risks related to changes in regulations to which Ei Group is subject or the introduction of new regulations to which it may become subject, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Major sporting events can also affect Ei Group’s revenue.

(b) Non-underlying operating costs before depreciation and amortization comprise operating costs that Ei Group regards as one-off operating costs as well as other adjusting items. Ei Group applies judgment in identifying the significant items of income and expense that are recognized as non-underlying to provide an indication of Ei Group’s underlying business performance. Non-underlying operating costs before depreciation and amortization included (i) for the year ended September 30, 2017, assignment premiums of £6 million in connection with the strategic realignment of properties (i.e., to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other than at renewal) and restructuring costs of £3 million, (ii) for the year ended September 30, 2018, assignment premiums of £4 million in connection with the strategic realignment of properties as well as restructuring costs of £1 million, (iii) for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, assignment premiums of £1 million in connection with the strategic realignment of properties, (iv) for the year ended September 30, 2019, assignment premiums of £8 million in connection with the strategic alignment of properties and £5 million in 147 ----- connection with the Transaction, primarily relating to advisory fees, and (v) for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, assignment premiums of £1 million in connection with the strategic realignment of properties. (c) Ei Group Underlying EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019 of £270 million includes the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA contributed by (i) the 355 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment and (ii) 124 assets in the ordinary course that were disposed of during this period. These disposed assets contributed £6 million and £1 million, respectively, to Ei Group Underlying EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019. Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2019 of £276 million includes the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA contributed by (i) the 354 assets under its Ei Group Commercial Properties segment and (ii) 129 assets in the ordinary course that were disposed of during this period and compares to Ei Group Underlying EBITDA of £287 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. These assets contributed £13 million and £1 million, respectively, to Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2019, and £26 million and £1 million, respectively, to Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2018. Accordingly, adjusting for these disposals, Ei Group Underlying EBITDA from Ei Group’s retained business increased from £260 million for the year ended September 30, 2018 to £262 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. For the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, the Underlying EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) for Ei Group Publican Partnerships, Ei Group Managed Pubs, Ei Group Commercial Properties and central, was £70 million, £13 million, £3 million and negative £12 million, respectively. Ei Group EBITDA and Ei Group Underlying EBITDA are non-IFRS measures that have important limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of Ei Group’s results as reported under IFRS. See “Certain Definitions” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” (2) Excludes the impact of IFRS 16. (3) Ei Group Underlying EBITDA Margin represents Ei Group Underlying EBITDA divided by Ei Group revenue. Underlying EBITDA Margin for each of Ei Group’s operating segments (i.e. Ei Group Publican Partnerships, Ei Group Managed Pubs and Ei Group Commercial Properties) represents Underlying EBITDA of the relevant segment divided by revenue of that segment. (4) Ei Group Cash Conversion represents Ei Group Underlying EBITDA less Ei Group Letting and Maintenance Capital Expenditure, divided by Ei Group Underlying EBITDA. This metric is calculated on a basis similar to that for Stonegate Group and does not seek to represent any cash conversion or similar metric historically disclosed by Ei Group. Ei Group Letting and Maintenance Capital Expenditure is presented under “—Ei Group Capital Expenditure.” (5) Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth represents the percentage growth in the pub level net income from the Ei Group Publican Partnerships estate for all pubs that have traded as Ei Group Publican Partnership pubs for at least one full year prior to the start of the relevant period excluding income in respect of disposals and other non like for like net income and costs. (6) Ei Group Managed Pubs Like for Like Sales Growth represents the percentage growth in the revenue from sites in the Ei Group Managed Pubs estate which were invested at least one full year prior to the start of the relevant period. (7) Ei Group Like For Like Commercial Properties Net Income Growth represents the percentage growth in the asset level net income from the Ei Group Commercial Properties estate for all assets that have traded as Ei Group Commercial Properties for at least one full year prior to the start of the relevant period excluding income in respect of disposals and other non like for like net income and costs. (8) Ei Group Publican Partnership Pubs Site EBITDA represents the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for Ei Group Publican Partnership pubs trading at the end of the period (excluding income in respect of disposals and other non like for like net income and costs) divided by the number of Ei Group Publican Partnership pubs trading at the end of the period. (9) Ei Group Commercial Properties Site EBITDA represents the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for Ei Group Commercial Property assets trading at the end of the period (excluding income in respect of disposals and other non like for like net income and costs and including net income relating to the pubs before they were transferred to the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment offset by unlicensed property income) divided by the total Ei Group Commercial Property assets trading at the end of the period. (10) Ei Group Return on Investment represents the return on investment for all pubs in Ei Group’s estate trading for more than three months following a growth capital investment of greater than £20,000, calculated by dividing the incremental income delivered as a result of such investment by the value of such capital investment. In respect of recently opened pubs in the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment, incremental income is calculated based on EBITDA based on current site performance. Ei Group Publican Partnerships Return on Investment represents the return on investment for pubs in the Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment trading for more than three months following a growth capital investment of greater than £20,000, calculated by dividing the incremental income delivered as a result of such investment by the value of such capital investment. Ei Group Managed Operations Return on Investment represents the return on investment for pubs in Ei Group’s Managed Operations division trading for more than six months following a growth capital investment of greater than £20,000, calculated by dividing the incremental income delivered as a result of such investment by the value of such capital investment. Ei Group Managed Investments Return on Investment represents the return on investment for pubs in Ei Group’s Managed Investments division trading for more than six months following a growth capital investment of greater than £20,000, calculated by dividing the incremental income delivered as a result of such investment by the value of such capital investment and, in each case, excluding the minority interest of the expert partners. 148 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

All other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated so as to write off the total costs less residual value on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life.

Any revaluation that causes the book value of a property held in property, plant and equipment to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the income statement. If that same property later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the income statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognized. Where properties identified for disposal are revalued immediately prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, the revaluation movement is recognized on the same basis.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flows, applying an appropriate long-term growth rate and discounting using a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate. In the year ended September 30, 2019, based on external market trends, the long-term growth rate was reduced. Furthermore, the discount rate was increased to reflect market indicators identified following the Transaction.

Underlying operating costs for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 for Ei Group Managed Pubs, which primarily include staff costs and drink and food costs, increased by £12 million to £52 million from £40 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily reflecting higher operating costs due to an increase in the number of operating pubs in this segment. Underlying Central costs for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, which include costs for the staff supporting Ei Group’s operations for all segments, administrative expenses and certain property costs, decreased by £6 million, or 33.3%, to £12 million from £18 million from the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. _EBITDA_ Ei Group EBITDA for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 decreased by £1 million, or 1.4%, to £73 million from £74 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily driven by the disposal of 354 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment offset by an increase in Ei Group EBITDA due to the elimination of operating lease expense as operating cost pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16. Ei Group EBITDA Margin decreased slightly to 39.5% from 40.0% due to the growth of the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment where Ei Group earns higher revenue but has lower EBITDA margin. Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, which excludes non-underlying costs of £1 million incurred in respect of assignment premiums in connection with the strategic realignment of properties, decreased by £6 million, or 8.0%, to £69 million from £75 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 is calculated to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 and without the benefit of increase in EBITDA pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16, the Ei Group Underlying EBITDA decreased primarily due to the disposal of 354 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties. Ei Group Underlying EBITDA Margin decreased to 37.3% from 40.5% for the same period. The following table sets forth Underlying EBITDA for each of Ei Group’s segments:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Drink revenue for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 increased by £3 million, or 2.2%, to £142 million from £139 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs where Ei Group’s revenue reflects the full retail price of drinks partially offset by decreases in volume of beer supply to publicans. Rent revenue for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 decreased by £6 million, or 16.2%, to £31 million from £37 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to the disposal of 354 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment. Food revenue for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 increased by £1 million, or 20.0%, to £6 million from £5 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs where Ei Group’s revenue reflects the full retail price of food. Revenue from amusement and other machines for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 increased by £2 million, or 66.7%, to £5 million from £3 million for 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to a greater share of the income in the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment.

Underlying finance costs of £35 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 were £1 million lower than the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018 as a result of lower debt levels in the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 compared to the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, offset by an increase in finance cost represented by interest expenses on lease liabilities pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16 by Ei Group. Non-underlying finance costs of £1 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019, which were £1 million higher than the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, were primarily due to costs associated with the full prepayment of the Class A3 Unique Securitized Notes and part prepayment of the Class A4 Unique Securitized Notes. _Profit/(loss) before Tax_ Ei Group’s profit before tax for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 was £25 million compared to profit before tax of £29 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to the sale of 354 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment.

Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 from Ei Group Managed Pubs increased by £66 million, or 43.4%, to £218 million from £152 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting the addition of 107 pubs since the end of the year ended September 30, 2018 and improved performance in the pubs that traded under the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment during both periods, as reflected in the Ei Group Managed Pubs Like for Like Sales Growth of 5.0% for the year ended September 30, 2019.

Drink revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased by £35 million, or 6.8%, to £549 million from £514 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to broadly stable sales volumes to publicans, pricing and mix benefits and the increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs where Ei Group’s revenue reflects the full retail price of drinks. Rent revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 decreased by £16 million, or 10.6%, to £135 million from £151 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to the disposal of 354 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment and the allocation of pubs from the Ei Group Publican Partnerships segment to the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment where Ei Group receives no rent, which was partly offset by higher rent due to rent reviews. Food revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased by £5 million, or 33.3%, to £20 million from £15 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to the increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs where Ei Group’s revenue reflects the full retail price of food. Revenue from amusement and other machines for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased by £3 million, or 23.1%, to £16 million from £13 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a greater share of the income in the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment.

Underlying operating costs for the year ended September 30, 2019 for Ei Group Managed Pubs, which primarily include staff costs and drink and food costs, increased by £52 million to £176 million from £124 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting higher operating costs due to an increase of 107 operating pubs in this segment in the year ended September 30, 2019.

Underlying EBITDA Margin for Ei Group Managed Pubs increased to 19.3% from 18.4%, primarily reflecting improved like for like revenue and improved costs due to economies of scale. Underlying EBITDA Margin for Ei Group Commercial Properties is 100%. _Movements in Valuation of the Estate and Related Assets_ Charges recognized in the income statement for movements in valuation of the estate and related assets increased by £1 million, or 5.3%, to £20 million from £19 million during the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in valuation of the estate and related assets during the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to the year ended September 30, 2018, partially offset by a write-down of the assets held for sale during the year ended September 30, 2019. _Goodwill Impairment_ Goodwill impairment of £232 million was recognized for the year ended September 30, 2019 (compared to £0 in 2018) primarily reflecting a lower estimated recoverable amount compared to the carrying amount based on lower estimated value in use. Lower estimated value in use was, in turn, derived based on external market trends whereby the long-term growth rates used in the computation were reduced and the discount rate used in the computation was increased to reflect market indicators following the Transaction. _Finance Costs_ Ei Group’s finance costs for the year ended September 30, 2019 remained flat at £152 million. Underlying finance costs of £137 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 were £9 million lower than the year ended September 30, 2018 as a result of debt reduction. Non-underlying finance costs of £15 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, which were £9 million higher than the year ended September 30, 2018, were primarily due to costs of £14 million associated with the full prepayment of the Class A3 Unique Securitized Notes and part prepayment of the Class A4 Unique Securitized Notes from disposal proceeds. _Profit/(loss) before Tax_ Ei Group’s loss before tax for the year ended September 30, 2019 was £199 million compared to profit before tax of £87 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting recognition of £232 million of goodwill impairment during this period. Underlying profit before tax during the year ended September 30, 2019 was £118 million compared to £122 million during the year ended September 30, 2018. _Taxation_ Taxation charges for the year ended September 30, 2019 decreased to £10 million from £15 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting higher non-underlying tax credits received in the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to those received in the year ended September 30, 2018. A non-underlying tax credit of £8 million (compared to £1 million in 2018) was recognized in relation to the non-underlying items in the income statement for a total non-underlying tax credit of £11 million (compared to £7 million in 2018) for the year ended September 30, 2019. _Profit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Parent Company_ Loss after tax for the year ended September 30, 2019 was £209 million compared to a profit after tax of £72 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.

Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 from Ei Group Managed Pubs increased by £72 million, or 90.0%, to £152 million from £80 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily reflecting the addition of 99 pubs since the end of the year ended September 30, 2017 and improved performance in the pubs that traded under the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment during both periods, as reflected in the Ei Group Managed Pubs Like for Like Sales Growth of 7.1%. Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 from Ei Group Commercial Properties increased by £6 million, or 28.6%, to £27 million from £21 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the addition of 81 pubs (net of disposals) since the end of the year ended September 30, 2017, the improvement in the underlying quality of assets and increased rents on existing assets following rent reviews and annual RPI increases. 157 ----- The following table sets forth a breakdown of Ei Group’s revenues by source of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to the year ended September 30, 2017. Drink revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £41 million, or 8.7%, to £514 million from £473 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs where Ei Group’s revenue represents the full retail price of drinks, while higher beer prices and increased sales of premium products were offset by volume decline. Rent revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 decreased by £3 million, or 1.9%, to £151 million from £154 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily reflecting disposals of pubs and the allocation of pubs from Ei Group Publican Partnerships to Ei Group Managed Pubs where the Ei Group receives no rent, which was partly offset by higher rent due to rent reviews. Food revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £6 million, or 66.7%, to £15 million from £9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs where Ei Group’s revenue reflects the full retail price of food. Revenue from amusement and other machines for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £2 million, or 18.2%, to £13 million from £11 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the corresponding increase in the number of Ei Group Managed Pubs, where unlike Ei Group Publican Partnership pubs, Ei Group retains the entire revenue. Other revenue represents accommodation income in the Ei Group Managed Pubs and for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £1 million, or 100%, to £2 million from £1 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. _Operating costs before depreciation and amortization_ Ei Group’s operating costs for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £43 million, or 11.6%, to £413 million from £370 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. The increase primarily reflects the increase in the running costs of the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment as additional pubs were moved from Ei Group Publican Partnerships into this segment in the year ended September 30, 2018. Underlying operating costs, which exclude non-underlying costs of £5 million related to assignment premiums for the year ended September 30, 2018 were £408 million compared to £361 million for the year ended September 30, 2017.

Underlying Central costs for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £3 million, or 4.2%, to £75 million from £72 million from the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily reflecting the recruitment of additional personnel to assist in the delivery of Ei Group’s strategic objectives and additional administrative costs arising from the introduction of the Pubs Code. _EBITDA_ Ei Group EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £4 million, or 1.4%, to £282 million from £278 million during the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease of £4 million in non-underlying operating costs compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, due to a reduction of £2 million in the assignment premiums paid in connection with the strategic realignment of properties (i.e., to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other than at renewal) and a reduction of £2 million in restructuring costs. Ei Group EBITDA Margin decreased to 40.6% from 42.9% reflecting the growth of the Ei Group Managed Pubs segment where Ei Group earns higher revenue but has lower EBITDA margin, partly offset by the reduction in non-underlying operating costs for the year ended September 30, 2018. Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2018, which excludes non-underlying costs of £5 million related to assignment premiums paid and reorganizations costs, remained flat at £287 million.

The non-underlying finance costs during the year ended September 30, 2017 were incurred in connection with Ei Group’s refinancing of its revolving credit facilities and a partial refinancing of the Ei Group’s secured corporate bonds due 2018. Underlying finance costs for the year ended September 30, 2018 were £146 million compared to underlying finance costs of £149 million during the year ended September 30, 2017, reflecting a reduction in debt. 159 ----- _Profit/(loss) before Tax_ Ei Group’s profit before tax for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £29 million, or 50.0%, to £87 million from £58 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily reflecting lower non-underlying finance costs in the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to the year ended September 30, 2017. Underlying profit before tax for the year ended September 30, 2018 was £122 million compared to £121 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. _Taxation_ Taxation charges for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased to £15 million from £4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily reflecting lower non-underlying tax credits received in the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to the year ended September 30, 2018.

Net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2019 decreased by £24 million, or 8.9%, to £247 million compared to £271 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in operating profit resulting from the disposal of assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment in the year ended September 30, 2019 and an increase of £9 million in taxes paid in the year ended September 30, 2019 due to certain tax repayments received from the tax authorities in respect of overpayments in the prior year. Net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased by £10 million, or 3.8%, to £271 million compared to £261 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of tax payments during the year ended September 30, 2018 being offset by certain tax repayments received from the tax authorities in respect of overpayments in the prior year and capital allowance claims. _Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities_ Net cash flows from investing activities for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 was a cash outflow of £19 million compared to a cash outflow of £16 million for the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. The change primarily reflects higher Ei Group Capital Expenditure of £23 million in the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 as compared to £19 million in the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. Net cash flows from investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2019 was a cash inflow of £297 million compared to a cash outflow of £15 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The change primarily reflects the impact of proceeds from the disposal of 354 assets under the Ei Group Commercial Properties segment in the year ended September 30, 2019. Net cash flows from investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2018 was a cash outflow of £15 million compared to a cash inflow of £20 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. The change primarily reflects lower amounts received from the disposal of properties in the year ended September 30, 2018 of £66 million compared to £100 million received from the disposal of properties in the year ended September 30, 2017, due to lower disposal activity in the year ended September 30, 2018. _Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities_ Net cash outflows from financing activities for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2019 decreased by £9 million to £17 million compared to £26 million during the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018. The decrease in cash outflows primarily reflects reduced interest payment of £27 million (compared to £30 million during the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018), reclassification of lease payments as financing cash flow pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 16 by Ei Group, no payments towards Ei Group’s share repurchase program (compared to £11 million during the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2018) partially offset by reduced cash received from drawing under relevant loan facilities. Net cash outflows from financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2019 increased by £297 million to £546 million compared to £249 million during the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in cash outflows primarily reflects net loan repayments by Ei Group of £330 million during the year ended September 30, 2019 (compared to £66 million in 2018), including the full prepayment of the Class A3 Unique Securitized Notes and part prepayment of the Class A4 Unique Securitized Notes, and net share repurchases of £63 million, primarily relating to a share buyback program carried out by Ei Group in the year ended September 30, 2019. Net cash outflows from financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2018 decreased by £26 million to £249 million compared to £275 million during the year ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in cash outflows primarily reflects interest paid of £143 million (compared to £149 million in 2017), net loan repayments of £66 million compared to £77 million in 2017), net share repurchases of £21 million (compared to £16 million in 2017), bond purchases of £5 million (compared to £0 in 2017) and refinancing costs of £14 million (compared to £33 million in 2017). 162 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group’s capital allocation framework aims to ensure that all priority calls upon cash flows are satisfied, including corporation tax, interest, scheduled debt amortization and other debt refinancing objectives, followed by ongoing investment in its business. Cash flow from operations and proceeds from pub disposals are Ei Group’s key sources of liquidity. As of December 28, 2019, Ei Group had £1,175 million of Ei Corporate Bonds outstanding which are non-amortizing, a vast majority of which are secured against ring-fenced portfolios of freehold pubs and with fixed interest rates averaging approximately 6.5%. The Ei Corporate Bonds have maturities ranging from 2021 to 2031. Following the Transaction, the Ei Corporate Bonds have been redeemed in full (together with any accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premium). See “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure” and “Use of Proceeds.” As of December 28, 2019, Ei Group had outstanding £683 million of the Unique Securitized Notes. The indebtedness owed under the Unique Securitized Notes is required to be repaid in accordance with agreed amortization schedules up to and including the final maturity of the respective notes. As of March 28, 2019, Ei Group had paid £165 million ahead of the scheduled amortization. Operational cash generated from Unique Group has been used to meet this scheduled amortization of the Unique Securitized Notes. The Unique Securitized Notes amortize over a period to 2032 and have interest rates of between 5.7% and 7.4%. In connection with the Transaction, the indebtedness owed under the Unique Securitized Notes have been rolled over. Ei Group also has access to a renewable committed liquidity facility for a term of 364 days to meet its payment obligations under the amortization schedule in the event that it has insufficient funds to meet the payment. As of December 28, 2019, the amount available under the liquidity facility was £152 million. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Unique Securitized Notes.” In October 2016, Ei Group replaced a £138 million revolving credit facility with the £120 million Ei Group Revolving Credit Facility, commitments under which were increased to £140 million in March 2017 and to £150 million in August 2018. As of December 28, 2019, Ei Group had borrowings of £20 million under the Ei Group Revolving Credit Facility. Following the Transaction, the Ei Group Revolving Credit Facility has been repaid in full and cancelled. See “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure” and “Use of Proceeds.” _Post-retirement benefits_ Ei Group makes defined contribution payments to employees’ own pension plans.

Ei Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure the expected lifetime credit losses on its trade receivables. Ei Group analyzes its historic bad debt experience to create an ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the reporting date and writes off its trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the debt.

Ei Group’s licensed land and buildings recognized in property, plant and equipment, are revalued each year by external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations. 165 ----- Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognized as an expense in the income statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is recognized in the income statement as an expense. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Landlord’s fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings and short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions in the form of long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and additions to short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at five years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over the useful economic life. Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years. Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over three to 50 years on a straight line basis to residual value. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where any indicators are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill has been allocated to individual properties based on a relative value and on disposal of a property, this attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with Ei Group’s operating segments. These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding projected cash flows as adjusted for the forecast level of disposals. The key assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections, and levels of working capital, as well as the choice of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the value-in-use of cash flows. Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.

Properties acquired under finance leases are capitalized at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable. Properties held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the income statement. Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over the lease term. The fair value attributed to properties acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within non-current assets and are amortized over the lease term. Ei Group has previously entered into sale and leaseback transactions where licensed land and buildings have been sold and Ei Group has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiree.

More recently, about three decades ago, the pub industry was dominated by six large brewers (Scottish & Newcastle, Allied, Bass, Courage, Grand Met and Whitbread) who controlled just over half of all UK pubs and accounted for approximately 75% of UK beer production. In 1989, a report drafted by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that a complex monopoly existed in favor of brewers who owned tied houses or who had tying agreements with free houses in return for loans (brewer loans) at favorable interest rates. Subsequently, The Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989 (“the Beer Order”) was passed to force the sale of 50% of breweries’ pub estates in excess of 2,000 units by November 1992. This led to the development of the independent pub company, which took over ownership of many of these pubs from the breweries. These pub companies typically negotiate agreements with the breweries for the supply of beer and then on-sell that beer to the pubs they own, thus intervening in the direct sale of beer from breweries to pubs. Since then, pub companies have increased their ownership of pubs in Britain. In 2006, pub companies owned approximately 52% of UK pubs, with the two largest, Punch Taverns and Ei Group, controlling approximately 30% of the UK pub sector. The Beer Order were revoked in 2002 pursuant to the Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) (Revocation) Order 2002, following a review by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which found that the sector had undergone significant changes in ownership, such that concerns relating to brewers’ vertical integration and the Beer Order were not relevant anymore. The ownership of pubs in the United Kingdom is broadly spread across three main categories of owners: - Brewer-owned pubs, typically operating under a ‘tied contract’; - Independent pub companies that either manage pub operations by themselves or lease the pubs out to tenants; and - Independent pub owners, who are typically individuals with either a single pub/bar or a small portfolio of sites.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The pubs’ business models include managed, leased and tenanted (of which some are commercial or free-of-tie properties) and independently owned, constituting approximately 19%, 33%, and 48%, respectively, of UK pubs for 2018 according to the BBPA. For bars, a variety of late night offerings exist, differentiated by the tempo of the environment, variety of product offerings and target consumer base. _Managed Pubs_ Managed pub companies directly employ central management and local staff and have complete control over the sales format and product offering within each pub. As a result, they benefit from the entire revenue, are responsible for all costs, and ultimately retain all of the net income generated from their 167 ----- operations. Managed pub operators have performed particularly well within the pub industry over the past few years and have improved their market share compared to leased and tenanted pub operators and independent pubs. Managed pubs also typically generate higher gross margins than publicans or independent pubs, as leased and tenanted pubs are generally required to purchase their beer at a premium from the pub companies that lease the pubs to them, while independent pubs lack the scale to buy on terms as good as those from which large pub companies benefit. Apart from Stonegate Group, key operators within the managed sector include Mitchells & Butlers and JDW, as well as some of the estates of Marston’s, Greene King, Young’s and Fuller’s. _Operator Agreement_ Pubs governed by operator agreements are typically run in a quasi-managed/franchised model, whereby the pubs are owned by the pub company and are run by self-employed operators who receive a percentage of revenue generated and are responsible for organizing and paying the staff. The remaining revenue, other costs and management responsibility belong to the pub company. These sites benefit from having the managed pub knowledge base with respect the areas of pricing, marketing, range and scale while simultaneously benefitting from local operators who are embedded in the communities they serve. _Leased and Tenanted Pubs_ Leased and tenanted pubs are typically owned by a pub company or brewer but are operated by a third party tenant or lessee, who normally pays below market rent to the owner and is normally contractually obligated to purchase the majority of its supply of drink products (in particular, beer) from the owner, an arrangement known as the “tie.” Tied publicans typically enjoy support and certain benefits from pub companies as part of the arrangement, such as marketing advice, capital investments or training courses. Importantly, the publican also benefits from receiving living accommodation above the pub, allowing that person to cover quiet trading hours without having to employ anyone. While the publican rents the building and fixtures and purchases the drinks from the pub companies, the pub companies have limited direct influence on revenue generation (though there can be ways to incentivize volumes sold through beer discounts) and limited exposure to the costs of the pubs, as the pubs effectively operate independently and are responsible for their own operating costs (i.e., labor, food/drink, energy and overheads). Following the acquisition of Ei Group, we are one of the largest leased and tenanted pub companies in the United Kingdom. Our main competitors in the leased and tenanted pubs segment are Star Pubs & Bars, Punch Taverns, Greene King and Marston’s. In July 2016, the Pubs Code introduced the MRO option to allow tenants to opt to pay rent at a free-of-tie commercial rate without requiring them to purchase drinks from the pub company. See “Ei Group’s Business—Regulation—The Pubs Code and Market Rent Only (MRO).” These leases tend to be comparable to regular commercial real estate leases with upward rent reviews only. The typical lease duration for commercial properties is 10 years or less. _Independently Owned Pubs_ Independently owned pubs (sometimes known as “freehouses”) are generally smaller, standalone pubs owned by private individuals who have free rein over the products offered. Their average revenue is generally similar to tenanted pubs. _Bars_ Bars are typically grouped into operating formats defined in part by their high or low tempo environments, whether they are accompanied by music and when their peak operating hours and closing times are. These venues are predominately drink-led, but may have a limited food offering. Further subdivision depends on the type of offering provided, which include late night bars, cocktail bars, wine bars, craft bars, other specialist bars and student unions or bars. 168 ----- _Typical Elements of Basic Pub Agreements_ The table below sets forth the distinguishing characteristics typical of the most common types of pub agreements in the United Kingdom:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

During the same period, a reduction in the total number of operating pubs and bars was observed, leaving the remaining pubs and bars to benefit from a more balanced market position, capturing customers from those venues that closed down. Average selling prices have increased as a result of factors such as the premiumization of drink offerings and underlying inflation. Further growth in pub revenues is expected from increased food sales and higher traffic as a result of entertainment offered in pubs, such as sporting events or live music. According to CGA, the total on-trade food and drinks market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.9% between 2019 and 2023. CGA has not revised its estimated forecasts in light of the impact on the UK pubs and bars sector of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot assure you that these forecasts will remain relevant, and will not be subject to change, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this sector become more apparent. 169 ----- ### On-trade UK Food and Drinks Market Value (£ billions) (£ billions) 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 **58.9** **60.4** **61.7 56.8** 39.714.43.9** **41.915.64.0** **42.916.43.5** **43.917.13.8** **45.818.34.0** **48.019.84.2** **49.420.64.3** **50.521.24.4** **52.822.54.6** **54.723.84.6** 25.14.8 26.44.9 27.25.0 27.75.0 21.3 22.3 23.0 23.0 23.5 24.0 24.5 25.0 25.7 26.3 27.0 27.6 28.3 28.9 2010A 2011A 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017A 2018A 2019A 2020E 2021E 2022E 2023E |54.7|58.9 60.4 61.7 56.8| |---|---| |52.8 45.8 48.0 49.4 50.5 4.6 4.6|4.8 4.9 5.0 5.0| |39.7 41.9 4 32 .. 59 4 33 .. 89 4.0 4.2 4.3 4.4|26.4 27.2 27.7| |3.9 4.0 16.4 17.1 18.3 19.8 20.6 21.2 22.5 23.8|25.1| |14.4 15.6|| |21.3 22.3 23.0 23.0 23.5 24.0 24.5 25.0 25.7 26.3|27.0 27.6 28.3 28.9| ||| |2010A 2011A 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017A 2018A 2019A|2020E 2021E 2022E 2023E| Alcoholic Drinks Food Non Alcoholic Drinks _Source: CGA (1) Results post 2017 are based on an updated quality model from CGA._",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

According to BBPA, supply has decreased from 63,500 sites in 1990 to 47,600 sites in 2018. Within this trend, smaller leased and tenanted pubs in non-prime locations closed down at a faster rate than pubs in the broader sector, resulting in pub operators selling off the less profitable parts of their estates. It is expected that pub operators will continue to close or sell unprofitable sites in the future (albeit at a slower rate), providing the stronger, more resilient pubs the opportunity to increase market share. According to BBPA, the number of leased and tenanted sites saw a decline of 24.7% over the five-year period from 2013 to 2018, with managed pubs growing 22.7% over the same period. This demonstrates that pub companies are recognizing the benefit of being able to directly invest in and operate their estates, including each estates’ approach to branding, through a managed operating model, as opposed to relying on their tenants to do so under the leased and tenanted operating model.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

According to Experian, between 2014 and 2019, a population growth of 3% was seen within city centers across the United Kingdom. Our target locations consist of the top 100 towns, excluding London, with the most number of pubs from our combined group’s estate in town centers. Pubs in such target locations represented approximately 50% of Stonegate Group’s total estate as of April 12, 2020, and approximately 25% of Ei Group’s total estate as of April 12, 2020. Overall population growth is reinforced by the construction of new developments, which are replacing retail outlets within city center locations. These developments have been built at twice the rate in our target locations when compared to Great Britain as a whole, demonstrating our exposure to more attractive trading locations that benefit from increased footfall. Regionally, population growth from 2014-2019 was even more pronounced, with Stonegate Group’s East Midland centers growing by 18.9% and its centers in North East England growing by 19.2%. City centers are therefore continuing to receive investment and drawing an increased number of target customers that reside within close proximity to pubs and bars, increasing access and ease of use for those that previously commuted or lived in suburban areas. The town centers and high streets are also becoming increasingly diversified through the introduction of more late night offerings (typically operated in bar formats), where the venues focus on differentiated forms of entertainment and events from the pub sector, hence appealing to an additional segment of customers within the broader drinking out market. We have strong operations in both of these segments, and we believe we can increase our revenues with access to two different demographics and protect against potential challenges in one segment. Pub and bar operators also benefited from revenue concentration; that is, a smaller number of pubs and bars now share the same total revenue that was previously fragmented across a larger number of pubs and bars. This is in comparison to the casual dining sector, which has continued to face an oversupply. Pubs and bars in the United Kingdom stand to benefit from the governments’ ongoing recognition of the role of the high street and town centers to the communities and local economies. In this regard, the government announced, in its October 2018 budget, the introduction of the ‘Future High Streets Fund’, which falls within the £3.6 billion ‘Towns Fund’ launched by the government to support towns across England. The initiative seeks to utilize £1 billion of funding to help areas improve transport and access into town centers, convert empty retail units into new homes and workplaces, and invest in vital infrastructure, aiming to bolster the overall economy and drive local growth in these areas. The government announced in August 2019 that an additional 50 towns would benefit from the ‘Future High Streets Fund’. With our significant presence in town centers, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this funding. Furthermore, student towns have typically produced more consistent demand than non-student towns, due to the significant spend contribution that they bring to the area. As of April 12, 2020, approximately, 29% of all university campuses in the United Kingdom are within Stonegate Group’s target locations (i.e., the top 100 towns, excluding London). The breadth and diversity of our formats will allow us to remain aligned with consumer demand as the population mix in city centers continues to marginally change due to a growth in the number of students and young professionals.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

These factors have included lower prices at off-license stores and supermarkets, the smoking ban, the economic recession and a general cultural shift toward opting for premium or craft products over alcohol quantity. Ultimately, these factors have led to lower alcohol consumption. Despite the reduced level of alcohol consumption, the on-trade drinks market remains stable and resilient, with CGA projecting continued sales growth in the coming years. CGA has not revised its estimated forecasts in light of the impact on the UK pubs and bars sector of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot assure you that these forecasts will remain relevant, and will not be subject to change, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this sector become more apparent. 171 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including those discussed herein. Growth in the leased and tenanted sector has occurred across Great Britain (“GB”) with 1.6% growth in total long alcoholic drinks (i.e., draught drinks such as beer and cider) sold in 2019 compared to 2018. Regional growth outside of London has remained strong, especially in the North East England, Yorkshire and West England, where growth in total long alcoholic drinks sold in 2019 reached 4.0%, 4.6% and 2.3%, respectively, across the leased and tenanted market. Further resilience in the leased and tenanted sector is evidenced by CGA’s July 2019 BrandTrack survey, which shows that one in four GB consumers have visited a leased and tenanted pub in the past six months, equating to 12 million total customers over such 170 ----- period.

Customer demand for premium drinks such as craft beer, craft cider, micro-distillery spirits, premium mixers and cocktails has been growing. Within the on-trade market, the rapid growth in the popularity of cocktails has been particularly important in increasing the profitability of pubs and bars, driving increased volumes for spirits and allowing pub and bar operators to reposition themselves with higher per unit priced drinks. According to the CGA, strong volume growth has been primarily experienced by gin, sparkling wine, world lager and premium lager with increases of 39.5%, 8.6%, 7.2% and 2.8%, respectively, when comparing year on year volume growth for the period covering September 2018 to September 2019 against the period covering September 2017 to 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Pubs have proven to be increasingly popular venues for out-of-home dining as customers continue to look for value by choosing pubs over more expensive restaurants when eating out. The food offering increases the footfall in pubs and is an additional growth driver for the overall pub industry.

The combined group has three main segments: - _Publican Partnerships: Publican partnerships form a core operating segment of the combined group, made up of pubs owned or leased by the combined group and operated by publicans as their own businesses. A key feature of the publican partnerships operating model is “tie” arrangements, whereby most publicans have agreed under their lease or tenancy agreements to purchase beer and other beverages through us. We intend to continue to maintain these tie arrangements which, along with rental income, provide resilient and recurring earnings. - _Managed Pubs: Managed pubs are largely managed and operated by the combined group and derive their income predominantly from the retail sale of food and drinks, accommodation and gaming machines. The exception being pubs operated under the Craft Union Pub Company format, which are 178 ----- generally smaller operations managed and operated by self-employed operators under our guidelines for managed pub operations, with a sports, entertainment and drink-led retail offering but no food offering. Our managed pubs are strategically positioned to cater to different customer demographics and price points. Stonegate Group’s managed estate forms the majority of the combined group’s portfolio of managed pubs. - _Commercial Properties: Commercial properties consist of free-of-tie pubs and non-pub properties operated and managed by third-party leaseholders. Commercial properties derive their income predominantly from rental payments and contribute to the diversification of earnings by providing another source of recurring rental income.

Following the Transaction, on a combined basis, we are the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites (4,749 sites on a combined basis as of April 12, 2020). The combined group has strong real estate backing based on an estate of predominantly freehold properties (approximately 81% by number of sites and approximately 88% by value on a combined basis as of September 30, 2019) and a combined property asset value of approximately £4.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 (Stonegate Group: £798 million; Ei Group: £3.3 billion). The combined group is welldistributed through the United Kingdom, with a majority of pubs located at high street locations across London and the southeast region of the United Kingdom, and has diverse operating models, formats and brands. Revenue of the combined group is generated from a variety of sources, including drink and food sales (87.6% of pro forma revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019) and rental income (8.6% of pro forma revenue for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019). We believe that our diverse and agile business that delivers across operating models, formats and brands, led by Stonegate Group’s experienced and reputed management team, will be instrumental in driving revenue growth in the future. Stonegate Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 were £853 million, £19 million and £24 million, respectively, and Ei Group’s revenue, operating profit and loss after taxation on a historical basis for the year ended September 30, 2019 were £724 million, £247 million and £209 million, respectively. On a combined basis, Stonegate Group’s and Ei Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, was £1,598 million. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) on a combined basis for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020 would have been £494 million. We had strong strategic reasons to combine Stonegate Group and Ei Group. The Transaction adds Ei Group’s strong and stable publican partnership business to Stonegate Group’s leading managed pub business. It provides a significant pipeline of publican partnership pubs that we can convert into managed pubs where we identify value accretive opportunities. The scale of the combined operations presents numerous opportunities, including opportunities to realize significant cost savings through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group. This combination also gives us the ability to take advantage of value arbitrage opportunities that may not have been fully exploited by Ei Group before. The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on our industry and our business. It resulted in the UK government taking unprecedented steps to implement a national lockdown, restricting social gatherings and mandating closure of non-essential businesses, in each case, leading to business slowdowns and shutdowns. Pursuant to a directive of the UK government, our pubs closed for business on March 20, 2020 as part of national efforts to curb the spread of the disease. Our pubs reopened for business on July 4, 2020, and, as of July 19, 2020, we had reopened 77% of our managed pubs subject to government guidance. Late night formats where dancing is a key part of the offer, pubs aimed at the student demographic and most of our Be At One pubs remain closed during this initial phase of reopening. As of July 19, 2020, we believe that our publicans had reopened an estimated 89% of the pubs in our publican partnership estate. While we have seen certain positive early results based on our first week of trading after reopening, the impact of COVID-19 on our industry and our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and cannot be accurately predicted at this time.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group brings a high-quality and sustainable pub estate. The quality of its estate is evident in its geographic distribution and overall profile. Geographically, its pubs are favorably weighted toward more profitable areas such as those across London, the southeast region of the United Kingdom and other key cities, large towns and affluent postcodes, which we believe provides higher rental income and higher drinks sales based on higher volume. In terms of estate profile, Ei Group has succeeded in rationalizing its underperforming publican partnership pubs by pursuing a strategy of disposing of a number of these pubs, having halved the size of its publican partnership estate in the last ten years (from 6,820 pubs in 2010 to 3,424 pubs in 2019) and, prior to the impact of COVID-19, we estimated that less than 4% of its publican partnership sites produced an average weekly take of less than £4,000. In recent years, based on the operational flexibility provided by its multi-model estate Ei Group has also succeeded in creating a sustainable pub estate by, among other things, reducing the number of its longer-term tied leases and increasing the proportion of its tied businesses operating under shorter-term tenancy agreements of up to five years in length. These attributes of Ei Group’s estate also make it well suited for conversions into Stonegate Group’s managed pubs format, which is characterized by pubs that are mainly high street and drink-led and weighted toward the southern region of the United Kingdom, and we expect Ei Group’s estate of publican partnership pubs to serve as a long-term pipeline for such conversions. Stonegate Group brings the experience of, and proven model for, running a successful managed pubs business. Its multi-format strategy is aimed at attracting a wide customer demographic while being able to cater to various consumer trends. It has consistently delivered high returns on investment (Stonegate Group Return on Investment of 35.7%, 35.3% and 35.4% for the 156 weeks ended September 29, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017). Its management, who are the architects of its managed business model, have the knowledge, skill set and experience to run not only a successful managed pubs business but also a publican partnerships business, many of them having spent time working in that area. By combining the strengths of both entities, we expect to deliver a diverse and market leading business in the UK pub sector. The combined group brings diversity in terms of income sources (rental income, wholesale drink sales and retail drink and food sales), locations (distribution throughout the United Kingdom with a weighting in more profitable areas such as London, the southeast region of the United Kingdom and city and town centers), operating models (leased and tenanted, managed and commercial properties) and formats (branded or unbranded, within the managed pubs segment). The combined group is the largest pub company in the United Kingdom based on the number of sites. As of April 12, 2020, the combined group had 4,749 sites, compared to 2,864 pubs as of March 31, 2020 for its closest competitor, Greene King plc. While Ei Group has delivered a significant increase in value since 2015, we believe that combining its estate with Stonegate Group’s managed pub business will help unlock the full potential and size of Ei Group’s managed pubs business. With the flexibility to apply the format best suited to the demographic trends or customer base of a certain area, we will be able to overlay the appropriate brands and formats across Ei Group’s portfolio to maximize the performance of the wider combined estate. Our multiple formats will allow us to maintain a significant presence in growing cities without adversely affecting sales at our pubs in adjacent locations, as opposed to single format operators catering to select target groups. 179 ----- With diversification and greater scale, we believe that the combined group is better positioned to compete effectively against other market participants, which would benefit all stakeholders, including tenants, employees, customers and local communities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

In addition to creating value through cost savings, we create value through making investments and operational enhancements in the pubs that we acquire. We have a demonstrable track record of successful capital investments. Since our inception in 2010 and through January 19, 2020, we have refurbished 621 Stonegate Group pubs that we currently operate and have delivered consistently high returns on investment (Stonegate Group Return on Investment of 35.7%, 35.3% and 35.4% for the 156 weeks ended September 29, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017). As of April 12, 2020, we had 124 Stonegate Group pubs in which we have not invested while under TDR Capital’s ownership, and we believe that this pipeline, taken together with the sizeable pipeline created by the Transaction, provides strong investment and growth opportunities in the future. We also expect to utilize our knowledge and experience of delivering high returns on investment in relation to acquisitions of under-invested portfolios.

Over the last ten financial years, Ei Group has disposed of 3,371 sites at an aggregate value of £1,474 million, representing an average premium to book value of 20%. A majority of these disposals were in respect of underperforming assets, indicating the potential for extracting significant value from strategic disposals in the future.

Stonegate Group Cash Conversion was 72.8%, 67.2% and 66.5% for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019, 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018 and 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017, respectively, driven by its growth over time and favorable returns on investment capital expenditures. The Stonegate Group Maintenance Capital Expenditure has also remained consistent over time (2019: £36 million, 2018: £37 million and 2017: £35 million). For the combined group, we have estimated that the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Including Synergies (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) would have been £494 million for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. We estimate that approximately £80 million of this amount will derive from cost savings that we expect to realize from the combination of Ei Group and Stonegate Group. Our cash conversion profile has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to a significant decline in our EBITDA due to the government-mandated closure of our pubs. In terms of capital expenditure, we currently intend to keep discretionary spending at a minimum, and until our cash reserves recover to desirable levels, we plan to make capital expenditure through a careful and considered approach. For a discussion of our short-term capital expenditure plans, see “Stonegate Group Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Stonegate Group Capital Expenditure.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2320,EI GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2320.78,Our Strengths,2320.78.5,Well positioned to outperform in a stable and defensive market,"We believe that the combined group’s estate is optimally positioned to outperform in terms of market share based on revenue in a stable and defensive UK pub market. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading pub and bar operators delivered robust like for like sales growth, as consumers spent on low-priced items in leisure activities and transitioned to premium drinks, which typically provide higher profit margins. Price increases in the on-trade segment, greater range of products and the consumer trend in favor of premium products has resulted in an increase in the pub industry’s sales despite a decline in overall volumes. Consumers ordered products that are more expensive and spent more per transaction, as opposed to buying larger amounts of cheaper alcohol. This resulted in an increase in the value of sales in the UK on-trade food and drinks market to an estimated £55 billion in 2019, representing an increase of approximately 38% since 2010. Consumer demand for premium drinks such as craft beer, craft cider, micro-distillery spirits and premium mixers has also been increasing over time, with the best performing drinks categories being premium, while standard categories of drinks performed less favorably. Sales volumes of draught craft beer, gin, draught premium world lager and sparkling wines increased. Collectively, these changes generated higher profit margins for pub operators. If these trends continue once the industry returns to a steady state following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these trends for a number of reasons. The diversity of our formats and the range of our products provide us the agility to cater to developing consumer preferences, such as a higher demand for premium products, while also providing natural insulation against changes in consumer preferences. The geographic weighting of our pubs toward more profitable regions of the United Kingdom where revenues per pub are generally higher (e.g., London, the southeast region of the United Kingdom, city and town centers), give us locational advantage in terms of access to more concentrated marketplaces and to consumer demographics that are more likely to spend on premium products. Furthermore, we believe that the UK government’s increased focus on ensuring that high streets continue to thrive and receive suitable investments will lead to an increase in footfall at city and town centers, which will also be to our advantage. The UK pub market has historically been overcrowded. Over the last four decades, a number of unprofitable and smaller leased and tenanted pubs have exited the market. This has led to a long-term decline in the number of pubs and bars in the United Kingdom, with the total UK pub market size contracting from approximately 63,500 pubs in 1990 to approximately 47,600 pubs in 2018, and this trend may continue. While the long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK pub market may be difficult to predict, in the short and medium term it may lead to a number of changes in industry trends and practices. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on sales volumes in 181 ----- pubs located in town or city centers as compared to our pubs located in suburbs. In addition, high streets may offer more real estate opportunities for pubs and bars due to the reduction in retail space and there may be increased demand for stable freehold assets. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our offering within the UK pub market because of our ability to offer the best format for each specific target market and to exist in multiple sites across city, town centers and suburban sites without adversely affecting sales at our pubs in adjacent locations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The combined group is led by our CEO, Simon Longbottom, who has more than 25 years of experience in the leisure industry. Prior to joining us, Mr. Longbottom was a Managing Director of Pub Partners, the tenanted division of Greene King plc, as well as a Managing Director of Gala Coral’s gaming division. He has also held senior positions with Mill House Inns and Mitchell’s & Butlers plc. The combined group will also benefit from the strong experience of our Chairman, Ian Payne, MBE, who has more than 40 years of industry experience and helped found Stonegate Group in 2010. Mr. Payne, an accomplished expert in the licensed leisure sector, has held board positions with Bass Taverns, Stakis plc and Ladbrokes gaming. He was CEO of the Laurel Pub Company (which included a large leased and tenanted portfolio), from its inception in May 2001 through to December 2004, and was involved in the sale of Laurel Pub Company to Ei Group. He later became Chairman of Bay Restaurant Group and Town and City Pub Group. In November 2019, he was recognized for his contribution to the sector and received the CGA Peach Industry Icon award. With the leadership of our strong senior management team, we have grown our revenues from £697 million for the 52 weeks ended September 24, 2017 to £853 million for the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2019 representing an increase of 22.2%. The combined group continues to have strong sponsor backing from TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm, which managed funds of over €10 billion of committed capital as of the end of 2019. On July 17, 2020, TDR Capital contributed equity of £50 million to support our business in light of the challenges presented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to retain this amount as cash on our balance sheet and to utilize it to finance our business and operational needs as required. We believe that TDR Capital’s active support, combined with the depth of our management’s industry experience, provides for efficient decision-making and insightful leadership for the combined group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2320,EI GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2320.79,Our Strategies,2320.79.1,Business as usual,"- **Ei Group Publican Partnerships: We plan to continue to operate the publican partnerships business acquired from Ei Group, which represented the core segment of Ei Group’s business, in its existing form. Ei Group shaped a stronger and more profitable publican partnership business by strategically disposing of underperforming, smaller and secondary assets over time, having halved the size of its publican partnerships estate in the last ten years (from 6,820 pubs in 2010 to 3,424 pubs in 2019). The Ei Group Like for Like Publican Partnerships Net Income Growth was 1.2%, 1.2% and 2.3% in the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We intend to continue to invest in the publican partnership portfolio to ensure that our publicans have the infrastructure that they require to provide the best customer experience and to increase site profitability. - **Stonegate Group Managed Pubs: Our strategy for Stonegate Group’s managed pubs business has consistently yielded positive results and we intend to continue to pursue them to the extent that we can in light of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our existing strategy includes continued capital investments, responsiveness to industry trends, pricing improvements, labor efficiency and the implementation of operational best practices across the Stonegate Group estate. We have discussed them in more detail below. 182 ----- The success of our existing strategy is reflected in Stonegate Group’s growth over time. Stonegate Group’s revenue has increased from £558 million in 2014 to £853 million in 2019, representing an increase of 52.9% during this period. _Continue capital investments_ We intend to maintain our commitment to capital investment to continue to improve business performance and to further increase market share. As of April 12, 2020, we had 124 Stonegate Group pubs in which we have not invested while under TDR Capital’s ownership, and we believe that this pipeline, taken together with the sizeable pipeline created by the Transaction, provides strong investment and growth opportunities in the future. We also intend to continue to make second-round capital investments where we see opportunities to create additional value. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to manage cash outflows and preserve and build liquidity, we currently intend to keep our discretionary spending to a minimum. As a result, until our cash reserves recover to desirable levels, our ability to make capital investment may temporarily be limited. However, we plan to continue making opportunistic capital investment through a careful and considered approach. _Continue to concentrate on our core operating initiatives_ We intend to deliver sustainable profit growth through our core operational initiatives: - _Transition to Premium: Customer demand for premium drink categories has been growing, particularly demand for premium lager and craft beer. In response to this trend, we have consistently increased our offering of premium, higher-value products (including cocktails) to take advantage of increasing demand for premium categories of drinks products. For the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, our revenue mix from premium drinks increased 0.5%, 3.1%, and 0.6% in revenue mix from premium lager, premium spirits and cocktails, respectively, compared to the revenue from these products for the 52 weeks ended January 20, 2019. Our mix of formats and our experience running Be At One, a group of premium specialist cocktail bars that we acquired in 2018, we believe positions us well to continue to benefit from this trend. - _All-Day Formats: Consumers are increasingly considering food offerings at pubs when deciding where to drink. In response to this trend, we have been developing and improving our food offering to increase footfall and drink sales across our pubs. This has also helped us to generate revenue during periods in the day when drink sales are relatively lower. For example, food accounted for 33% of pre-5:00 p.m. sales across our pubs for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020. - _Creating Experiences: We deliver memorable customer experiences. We organize a variety of events centered around music and sports to attract and retain our customers. - _Digitalization and Technology: To promote brand awareness and customer retention across our core customer age group of 18 to 35 year olds, we have increased our focus on digital marketing. Our brands (including Be At One) currently have over 3 million Facebook followers in aggregate. We have also developed an app, “We Love Sport”, which allows customers to place orders while seated at their tables and to discover where select sport events are being screened. Be At One also recently joined the Uber Eats platform, where customers in the vicinity of select bars can get their cocktails delivered to their homes. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are implementing a number of technologyfocused measures at our pubs, including the use of online menus and online booking and payment applications, as well as encouraging contactless payments. We believe that these technology innovations could help drive utilization in our pubs during peak hours and improve our gross margin. _Continue to focus on improving margins_ - _Pricing Improvements: Our pricing strategy focuses on promoting premium products, ensuring that price increments between products are in line with the quality of those products and that each step-up is evenly distributed. We also focus on price rationalization, to ensure that prices are consistent within sites across the same format, and the centralized approval of all promotions, which is aimed at rationalization of discounts. - _Labor Efficiency: Our labor strategy focuses on making staffing practices more efficient, with a view to tailoring our staffing requirements based on consumer demand and customer traffic at various times during the day and year. The proactive management of our staffing requirements have been helpful in partially mitigating the impact of National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage. 183 ----- - _Adoption of Best Practices: Our acquisitions have given us an opportunity to gain insight into a variety of best practices of our peers. For example, following the First Novus Acquisitions, we brought on board the target’s events team that specialized in developing and implementing pre-booking and group event strategies. We believe that this expertise helped us improve our sales margins through the increase in pre-bookings and group events across our estate. We plan to continue to learn from and, where useful, adopt, the best practices of our peers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2320,EI GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2320.79,Our Strategies,2320.79.2,Format conversions supported by investment,"We intend to utilize Stonegate Group’s ability to deliver market-leading operating performance across Ei Group’s managed estate and publican partnerships estate. We also intend to utilize the value creation opportunities provided by the operating model of Ei Group’s Craft Union pubs. These strategies are discussed in more detail below. However, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to fully implement these strategies may temporarily be limited. _Conversions from publican partnerships to managed pubs_ Consistent with the strategy pursued by Ei Group in the past, we expect to continue to convert a number of publican partnership pubs that we have acquired from Ei Group into managed pubs. Ei Group’s publican partnership estate provides a large pipeline for these conversions, with an estimated 82% of its publican partnerships estate, becoming available for conversion within the next five years. We have carried out site visits of the entire Ei Group publican partnerships estate to assess the potential for site conversions, and estimate that approximately 28% of the sites visited are suitable for conversion into managed pubs at profitable levels. We expect these conversions to result in higher profitability. Above a minimum level of sales, managed pubs typically generate incremental profit on a unit basis when compared to a publican partnership pub by retaining the earnings that would otherwise have been retained by publicans in a publican partnership model. Additionally, through our capital investments program, whereby we estimate we will invest, on average, approximately £350,000 to £400,000 per pub to implement these conversions, we would expect to achieve an estimated return on investment of approximately 35% to 50%. _Expand the Craft Union operating model_ Craft Union is one of the divisions that Ei Group operated within its managed pubs segment. These pubs are run by self-employed operators who receive a fixed percentage of the revenue generated at these pubs and are responsible for organizing and paying staff. Its operating model provides the benefits of a managed pub model, in terms of control over investments, formats and operations (e.g., in areas of pricing and marketing), while also providing certain benefits of the publican partnership model, in terms of allocating responsibility to the pub operator for labor, staffing and other costs. These pubs tend to be drink-led with no food offering and have a sports focus. We believe that the Craft Union format is particularly well suited for drink-led pubs with lower revenues. We believe we can create value by improving the existing Craft Union pubs and also by converting existing publican partnership pubs into the Craft Union format. These conversions should be simple to execute and we should be able to achieve scale with speed. We estimate that we will invest, on average, approximately £125,000 per pub to convert publican partnership pubs into Craft Union pubs, which gives us the opportunity to increase profitability at lower levels of capital investment.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2320,EI GROUP MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2320.79,Our Strategies,2320.79.3,Cost reduction by realizing synergies,"We believe that there are significant opportunities for cost savings through integrating operating models and applying best practices across Stonegate Group and Ei Group, and by gaining increased scale through the combined operations. Based on our current estimates, we believe we will be able to achieve approximately £80 million in cost savings resulting from streamlined procurement costs, optimized site operations and expected head office synergies. These cost savings have been estimated relative to costs incurred by Stonegate Group and Ei Group on a combined basis for the financial year 2019. We estimate that we will realize approximately £32 million of these cost savings, which represents approximately 40% of our total expected cost savings, by December 2020. We expect to realize the remaining cost savings by December 2021. _Procurement: Stonegate Group and Ei Group are predominantly drink-led businesses procuring_ comparable products. As a result of the Transaction, our estate has grown from 760 sites as of January 19, 2020 to 4,749 sites on a combined basis as of April 12, 2020, presenting a significant opportunity for us to utilize the scale of the combined business and renegotiate suppliers’ terms to reduce our procurement 184 ----- costs. Ei Group’s drinks requirement is more heavily weighted toward beer and cider, with a greater purchase volume in these categories compared to Stonegate Group. For this reason, Ei Group benefits from better pricing terms for beer and cider. We believe that by migrating the rest of the group to Ei Group’s pricing structure, we can achieve significant cost savings. Moreover, we believe that transitioning to supply contracts that bundle BCF (i.e., beer, cider and flavored alcoholic beverages) or WSM (i.e., wines, spirits and minerals) or food, we will be able to achieve better pricing terms overall in light of the size of the combined group. Based on our current estimates, we expect to achieve aggregate procurement savings of approximately £43 million. We estimate that we will realize approximately £11 million of these savings by December 2020, and the remaining £32 million by December 2021. _Head office and site operation synergies: We are in the process of carrying out a detailed review to_ implement the integration of Stonegate Group and Ei Group. Based on the outcome of this review, there may be a controlled reduction in the combined group’s headcount. This would include rationalizing certain corporate and support functions at Ei Group’s head office where there is duplication with our existing functions or where the function was required to support Ei Group’s status as a publicly listed company. The chairman of its board of directors, the non-executive directors, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer resigned effective March 3, 2020. Based on our management’s initial assessment, which is subject to a more detailed review that we expect to complete within six months from the Transaction, the aggregate cost savings from these resignations and the elimination of remuneration payable to senior management and certain other head office employees, will be approximately £7 million. Based on our current estimates, we expect to achieve approximately £37 million of cost savings relating to head office and site operation synergies. We estimate that we will realize approximately £22 million of these savings by December 2020, and the remaining £15 million by December 2021. We also plan to drive cost savings at the site level by implementing various operational best practices and achieving greater efficiency across the combined group. For example, Stonegate Group’s repairs and maintenance system, ProNett, will be implemented across the combined group, enabling better cost management in this category and generally a better approach to managing expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

In addition to the format conversions discussed above, we will assess each site in the portfolio for its value within the combined group against its alternative value. This will involve assessing sites for their value in alternative commercial or residential use and as a pub in the ownership of another group. Realizing such value in our portfolio will enable the group to redeploy disposal proceeds into the estate and help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity position and our ability to invest in the short term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

We have since grown in size and scale through a series of strategic acquisitions. In 2011, we acquired Town & City, which owned 226 leasehold pubs, helping us grow our geographical presence in the United Kingdom and to develop our formats to cover a wider demographic catchment. In 2013, we acquired 12 pubs from Living Room, which allowed us to strengthen our presence in some of the major cities across the United Kingdom, including London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol. Again in 2013, through our acquisition of 78 pubs from the Bramwell, we were able to further grow our reach within the United Kingdom, particularly in cities and towns where we did not have an existing presence. In 2015, we acquired 15 pubs from Maclay, which allowed us to expand our presence in the major cities and towns of Scotland, and we agreed to acquire 53 hand-picked pubs from TCG, allowing us to continue to strengthen our presence throughout the United Kingdom. In December 2016, we acquired Intertain, which operated 30 pubs across the United Kingdom predominantly under the Walkabout brand, a dedicated sports format popular with millennials, expanding our reach to town and cities where previously we did not have any sites, such as Carlisle and Lichfield. In 2017, we selectively acquired 13 pubs from JDW and acquired three central London pubs from the Faucet Inn Sellers. In 2018 and 2019, we acquired 33 pubs pursuant to the Be At One Acquisition, 15 pubs pursuant to the First Novus Acquisitions, 32 pubs pursuant to the Fever Bars Acquisition and six pubs pursuant to the Second Novus Acquisitions.

Further, we fully integrated into our current formats the pubs we acquired from Intertain, Large Bars, Faucet Inns, Ei Group (pursuant to the asset acquisitions from them in 2017) and Punch Taverns. Furthermore, we have fully integrated into our 187 ----- current brands and formats the pubs we acquired pursuant to the First Novus Acquisitions, Second Novus Acquisitions, the Fever Bar Acquisitions and the Be At One Acquisition.

Our unbranded group is split based on regions in the United Kingdom into the north, midlands and southern divisions. Each pub is managed by a general manager, who is incentivized to maximize profit through a bonus scheme that provides him or her 20% or 30% of their base salary plus 10% share of profits above the budget set by our senior management.

For Stonegate Group’s managed business, we pass through drink price rises annually in April, coinciding with alcohol duty increases in the United Kingdom. The government in the United Kingdom imposed a duty escalator which commenced in April 23, 2009, pursuant to which duties on alcohol rise each year by 2% above the rate of inflation (based on RPI). This duty escalation was removed from beer in the March 2013 budget and from spirits, wine and made-wine, cider and perry in the March 2014 budget, while the March 2015 budget subsequently reduced duty rates on beer, spirits and lower and high-strength cider, and froze duty rates on wine below 22% alcohol by volume and high-strength sparkling cider. In the March 2016 budget, duty rates on wine and made-wine at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by volume rose at the same rate as RPI inflation, but the UK government froze in cash terms the duty rates on beer, spirits and other drinks above 22% alcohol by volume and still cider and lower strength sparkling cider. In the March 2017 budget, the duty rates on alcohol manufactured in, or imported into, the United Kingdom rose at the same rate as forecast RPI inflation, and in the November 2017 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders were frozen. In the October 2018 budget, duty rates on beer and most other spirits and ciders remained frozen but specifically duty rates on wine and made-wine at or below 22% alcohol by volume and high strength sparkling cider above 5.5% alcohol by volume rose at the same rate as RPI inflation.

We have developed strong relationships with certain of our key suppliers, which have enabled us to benefit from attractive pricing terms. Stonegate Group’s managed pubs benefit from shared administrative, supply and logistics functions, thereby reducing costs and yielding cost synergies, including by giving us greater leverage when negotiating our supply agreements. We select Stonegate Group’s managed pubs food and drink suppliers based on quality, the price of their products and consumer tastes and preferences. For Stonegate Group’s managed pubs, we purchased the majority of the drink stock from approximately six suppliers during the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020, with our leading suppliers being Heineken UK, Molson Coors (UK), Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited, Diageo, Coca-Cola European Partners and Budweiser Brewing Company. The largest drinks supplier was Matthew Clark Wholesale Limited (accounting for approximately 57% of Stonegate Group’s drink supply cost for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020) followed by Heineken (UK) (accounting for approximately 9% of Stonegate Group’s drink supply cost for the 52 weeks ended January 19, 2020). Since many of Stonegate Group’s suppliers source the products that they supply in the United Kingdom, Stonegate Group has seen minimal impact of recent currency fluctuations since the announcement of Brexit in 2016. Stonegate Group has agreed to framework purchasing agreements with each of the suppliers to its managed pubs with an average term of two years, pursuant to which Stonegate Group’s managed pubs make purchase orders when needed. In addition, Stonegate Group is typically not bound by exclusivity arrangements with suppliers and most of its agreements with suppliers include a provision that allows it to renegotiate the pricing terms if its estate increases by 10% or more from the time the contract was entered into. In the past, Stonegate Group has typically been able to use these provisions to negotiate more favorable pricing terms with its suppliers. A substantial majority of the food supplied to Stonegate Group’s managed pubs is distributed through one supplier who, in consultation with Stonegate Group, in turn sources food supplies from other suppliers in the market.

In March 2020, the UK government also enacted the Coronavirus Act 2020, which is a wideranging emergency legislation, giving the UK government powers to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, such as the power to limit or suspend public gatherings, detain individuals suspected to be infected by COVID-19 and to relax regulations to limit transmission of the disease. Subsequently, the UK government issued The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No.2) (England) Regulations 2020, which came into force on July 4, 2020, and permitted, among others, pubs, bars, social clubs other on-licensed premises to open for business. _COVID-19 Guidelines_ Pursuant to the reopening of pubs, the UK government has also prescribed detailed guidelines to maintain social distancing and hygiene measures at pubs to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Some of the measures included in the guidelines include: - maintaining social distancing (two meters or one meter with risk mitigation where two meters is not viable); - not allowing indoor gatherings of more than two households, or outdoor gatherings with more than two households or six people in total from any number of households; - providing clear guidance on social distancing and hygiene to customers on arrival, for example, signage, visual aids and before arrival, such as by phone, on the website or by email; - encouraging contactless payments and the use of contactless ordering from tables; - keeping a temporary record of customers for 21 days and assist National Health Service’s Test and Trace service with requests for data if needed; - providing cutlery and disposable condiments only when the food is served; - using screens or barriers to separate workers from each other, and from customers at points of service; - keeping indoor and soft play areas closed; - reducing the need for customers to queue, but where this is unavoidable, discouraging customers from queueing indoors and using outside spaces for queueing where available and safe; - preventing customers from shouting and chanting due to the potential for aerosol transmission of COVID-19; - reconfiguring indoor spaces to ensure that customers remain seated rather than standing; and - generally, considering the cumulative impact of many pubs reopening in a small areas, which entails working with local authorities and neighboring businesses to assess the risk and applying additional mitigations. Where the enforcing authority (including the local authority) identifies businesses which are not taking actions to comply with the guidelines, the enforcing authority is empowered to take a range of actions. These include actions such as providing specific advice to support businesses achieving the required standard and issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to two years. In addition, there is a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed premises. 193 ----- _The Business and Planning Bill_ In June 2020, The Business and Planning Bill was introduced in the UK parliament. The bill seeks to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in the hospitality sector by simplifying and reducing the process and costs of obtaining outdoor licensing by pubs, bars, restaurants. In particular, the bill contains provisions allowing for a fast track application process for pavement licences to allow street furniture as well as permitting on–licensed premises to automatically be permitted to provide off-sales.

There is a two tier system for licensing: premises licenses and personal licenses. _Premises Licenses_ Premises licenses are held by Stonegate Group. The grant of a premises license permits the conduct of licensable activities at any premises. Licensable activities relevant to our operations are: - the sale of alcohol; - the provision of regulated entertainment; and - the provision of late-night refreshment, including the provision of hot food and drink after 11:00 p.m. There is no requirement to renew a premises license every year, but an annual fee is payable, and non-payment of the annual fee can lead to suspension of a premises license. Premises licenses are subject to various mandatory conditions, one of which is that there has to be a designated premises supervisor in respect of each premises license. A designated premises supervisor must by law hold a personal license. The licensing authorities, when making any decision under the Licensing Act, have to do so in accordance with the four licensing objectives, being: - the prevention of crime and disorder; - public safety; - the prevention of public nuisance; and - the protection of children from harm. The concept of fixed hours for the sale of alcohol was removed with the advent of the Licensing Act in November 2005, and all licensed premises now have flexibility (provided applicable licensing fees are paid) in terms of the hours that alcohol can be sold and entertainment and/or late night refreshment provided. This flexibility is however tempered by the fact that any decision to grant a license has to be determined by the licensing authority, having regard to both the licensing objectives, its statement of licensing policy and UK Home Office guidance. Each licensing authority produces its own statement of licensing policy, which must be revised at least every five years. The UK Home Office has produced its own guidance on the interpretation of the Licensing Act, which licensing authorities must have regard to when making any decisions. _Personal licenses_ Each designated premises supervisor must, by law, hold a personal license. Individuals apply to a licensing authority for a personal license where they habitually reside. A personal license is personal to the individual and is portable. The UK government has dispensed with the requirement to renew a personal license every ten years.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

All premises which have a premises license permitting the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises, granted under the Licensing Act, and which contain a bar at which alcohol is served, can provide machines available for public use. _Categories of Machines_ All such premises are automatically entitled to provide one or two machines of Category C or D (described below). To benefit from the use of these machines, the premises license holder must notify the licensing authority that it wishes to avail itself of the benefit of up to two Category C or D machines, and pay a £50 fee. There is no annual fee payable for this automatic entitlement, once the initial fee has been paid. If the premises wish to have more than two machines of Category C or D, then it must make an application to the licensing authority for a licensed premises gaming machine permit. Such applications may need to be determined by the licensing authority at a hearing. Once granted, an annual fee is payable for such permits. Category C machines have a maximum cash prize of £100, and a maximum stake of £1. Only persons aged 18 or over are allowed to play on Category C machines.

The Pubs Code applies to all companies owning 500 or more pubs operating under tied leased and tenancy agreements in England and Wales, and is overseen and enforced by an independent Pubs Code adjudicator. It provides tied publicans with a right, under certain circumstances, to replace their existing freely-negotiated tied agreements with the MRO arrangement. This enables tied tenants to opt out of the supply tie at certain points or after certain exceptional events during the term of their lease agreements and to occupy the premises on a standard commercial property lease, paying a market rent only. In the event that a tenant elects to invoke this option, while income derived from the supply of tied drinks products would be partially offset by increases in rent, it is possible that total income from that property would be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Changes in regulations to which we are subject or the introduction of new regulations to which we may become subject could have a negative effect on our business.” As of September 30, 2019, the extent of conversions to commercial free-of-tie agreements has been lower than was originally anticipated as there have been only limited numbers of publicans opting in for the MRO option. As of the same date, 1,626 out of Ei Group’s 4,011 sites, or 40.5%, operated on a tied lease. From the date of the introduction of the Pubs Code in July 2016 to September 30, 2019, there have been 1,662 rent review or agreement renewal events which could potentially have triggered an MRO request. As required under the Pubs Code, Ei Group issued 385 MRO offers in response to requests by tenants of which 213 have been concluded by way of mutually agreed tied deals and 52 have resulted in new mutually agreed MRO terms. In addition, 3 pubs have been sold, 29 leases have been repurchased from the occupational tenant with the balance of 88 pending. Of the outstanding 88, 36 have been referred to the Pubs Code adjudicator for determination. Of the 1,662 pubs referred to above, 1,048 pubs were still operated by the same tenant on either tied or new MRO agreements as of September 30, 2019. Such pubs delivered like for like net income increase of 0.7% during the year ended September 30, 2019, compared to the prior period.

Although Ei Group believes that the lower-than-expected number of MRO requests reflects its tenants’ recognition of the benefits of their existing tied agreements compared to the MRO alternative, Ei Group has reduced the number of longer-term leases and increased the proportion of shorter-term tenancy agreements of up to five years in length to minimize any adverse impact of the Pubs Code on its business. Since the introduction of the MRO concept in November 2014, Ei Group has reduced its number of longterm agreements from 3,035 to 1,552 as of September 30, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group was floated on the London Stock Exchange in November 1995.

During this period, Ei Group also completed a number of disposals to comply with the requirements of the Office of Fair Trading. During the years 2005 to 2015, Ei Group focused on the consolidation of its pub estate to enhance its quality by investing in the estate, acquiring high quality pubs and disposing of pubs that did not meet its profile in terms of quality and profitability. During this period and in light of challenging economic conditions, since September 2008, Ei Group accelerated its disposal program and applied the proceeds to repaying debt. In May 2015, Ei Group established its 2020 Strategy to increase its operational flexibility and asset optimization. As part of the implementation of this strategy, Ei Group grew its Ei Group Managed Pubs and Ei Group Commercial Properties businesses to achieve a multi-model operation with a balance of Ei Group Publican Partnerships, Ei Group Managed Pubs and Ei Group Commercial Properties. This provided Ei Group the ability to respond to changing market dynamics and regulatory requirements more quickly and effectively and enabled Ei Group to assess and implement appropriate measures to maximize its asset value.

Out of these pubs, as of December 28, 2019, 357 had been invested in and had traded for more than six months post-investment, generating an average annual site EBITDA of £111,000 from an average capital investment of £168,000, delivering Ei Group Managed Operations Return on Investment of approximately 22%. The Craft Union Pub Company format has national coverage as a leading scale operator of community pubs, with one clear retail offer that is drinks-led with quality beers, at affordable prices, served in local, well-invested facilities, with audio visual equipment for sports and entertainment. These pubs are generally smaller operations with no food offerings and have a sports and entertainment drink-led retail offer. They are run by self-employed operators who receive a percentage of the revenue generated in these pubs. Ei Group believes that the simplicity of the Craft Union Pub Company format helps to mitigate execution risks and improves the efficiency of its capital investment while utilizing economies of scale to drive down operating costs. The Bermondsey Pub Company format represents Ei Group’s fully managed pubs, which operate nationally with a drink-led retail offering with some food and is increasingly tailored to reflect the pre-existing retail offer and consumer occasion. _Managed Investments_ Within the Managed Investments segment, Ei Group has developed a partnership model whereby it can work with carefully selected managed pub operators to share in the benefits of trading in certain high quality and specialist retail segments. This business predominantly operates in premium consumer segments with attractive price elasticity and is therefore better able to mitigate the inflationary pressure that is challenging for more value-oriented, food-led businesses. 200 ----- As of April 12, 2020, Ei Group had 76 pubs operating within Managed Investments under a broad mix of operating styles with 10 expert partners. As of December 28, 2019, Ei Group had 59 pubs operating that had been invested in and traded for more than six months post-investment, generating an average annual site EBITDA of £180,000 from an average capital investment of £413,000, delivering a Ei Group Managed Investments Return on Investment of approximately 21%.

This business manages a developing portfolio of assets which Ei Group leases out to third parties on commercial property terms. The portfolio incorporates predominantly pub assets, which are let to tenants on a commercial free-of-tie basis and also assets that were previously pubs, now converted to an alternative use, such as a convenience store. Ei Group tenants include household names as well as independent public house and restaurant operators. This business segment contributed £14 million to Ei Group Underlying EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2019. Ei Group evaluates its assets on a regular basis, identifying opportunities to optimize value by bringing assets into its commercial property portfolio. While this is often done by granting a lease on a free-of-tie basis, Ei Group also adds value by obtaining planning consents and deploying development capital where there is an opportunity to release the embedded value in properties through development. During the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, Ei Group entered into 270 new free-of-tie agreements on common terms for such leases, at an average annualized rental income of £75,000 over an average term of 17 years. In the year ended September 30, 2019, Ei Group sold 354 commercial properties for net proceeds of £341 million.

Ei Group currently enters into one of two main categories of such lease or tenancy agreement with its publicans, under which the publican operates the pub as either a lessee or a tenant and agrees to pay the rent specified in the relevant agreement. The two main categories of Ei Group’s existing leases are: (i) standard lease (up to ten years) and (ii) standard tenancy (five years). In addition, Ei Group has previously granted agreements with a wider variety of terms to expiry and Ei Group has inherited some legacy agreements through acquisitions such that the estate includes lease agreements of between five and 65 years and tenancy agreements of between three and five years. As part of a lease or tenancy agreement, the publican also agrees in most instances that Ei Group is to be the sole supply for certain products. These “tie” arrangements relate primarily to the publican’s purchase 202 ----- of beer, cider, flavored alcoholic beverages, wines, spirits and minerals, sales of which generally constitute the majority of the publican’s revenue. In other instances the publican agrees to pay Ei Group a tie release fee on an ongoing basis in exchange for reduced purchase obligations whereby categories of beverages may not be subject to a tie arrangement. Standard leases are generally fully repairing, which means that the lessee is responsible for repairs to the premises during the term of the lease, and are generally fully assignable after two years (subject to Ei Group’s consent, which is not to be unreasonably withheld). Standard leases generally contain provisions for annual price index rent adjustments. Standard tenancies, which are short-term arrangements, involve Ei Group undertaking to carry out the majority of repairs to the relevant pub and are generally not assignable and subject to an annual RPI or CPI rent adjustment. Publicans are usually required to provide a deposit on entry into their tenancy agreement. Some forms of lease and tenancy agreement contain landlord’s or publican’s options to break the lease or tenancy. In addition, there may be circumstances in which Ei Group would allow a publican to terminate a lease or tenancy agreement early, as it is in Ei Group’s interest to have a motivated publican in its pub. The use of a lease or tenancy agreement and its terms and conditions vary according to the profit expectations, risk assessment and plans which Ei Group and the publican may have for the pub concerned.

The rent is agreed at the outset of each lease or tenancy agreement, and, in the case of new leases and tenancies, is based on its open market rental value. Some of Ei Group’s pubs are subject to rent reviews every five years. Following a rent review, the rent payable under a lease or tenancy agreement may either increase or decrease. There may also be a rent review on the last day of the term which effectively provides an initial rent for any renewal lease. 203 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Ei Group has developed strong relationships with its key suppliers enabling Ei Group to benefit from attractive pricing terms. Ei Group’s pubs benefit from shared administrative, supply and logistics functions, thereby reducing costs and yielding cost synergies. In addition, Ei Group’s publicans benefit from Ei Group’s bargaining leverage when Ei Group negotiates its supply agreements. Ei Group selects its food and drink suppliers based on quality, the price of their products and consumer tastes and preferences. The five largest international brewers accounted for 82 % of Ei Group’s drink supply volume for the year ended September 30, 2019. For risks related to our dependence on certain suppliers, see “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Business—We rely on a limited number of suppliers and distributors and, if such suppliers continue to consolidate, or face financial difficulties, prices we pay to our suppliers may rise or our operations may be disrupted.” Since many of Ei Group’s suppliers source the products that they supply to Ei Group in the UK, Ei Group has seen minimal impact of currency fluctuations since the announcement of Brexit in 2016. Ei Group has agreed framework purchasing agreements with each of its suppliers with an average term of three years. In addition, Ei Group typically is not bound by exclusivity arrangements to its suppliers and in some contract arrangements Ei Group has the ability to renegotiate its contracts if the size of its estate were to grow and/ or if Ei Group were to purchase other businesses.

Under this program, Stonegate Group extended cash loans to certain members of its senior management in order for them to purchase these shares. In November 2018, certain of Stonegate Group’s senior managers sold all or part of their Class B ordinary shares to one of Stonegate Group’s indirect parent companies for proceeds in an aggregate amount of £9.9 million. Managers who received these proceeds applied a portion of them to repay the cash loans that were initially made to them in connection with their acquisition of Class B ordinary shares. In November 2018, Stonegate Group also paid bonuses in an aggregate amount of £16 million to certain of its senior managers under this program. This bonus payment was financed by equity contributions made by Midco. In February 2019, Stonegate Group implemented a management incentive program, under which certain existing and new members of Stonegate Group’s management purchased Class B ordinary shares of Midco. This management incentive program replaced the old one and has substantially similar terms and conditions. For example, in the event of a transfer of all the shares of Stonegate Group, an initial public offering, an asset sale of all or substantially all of Stonegate Group’s assets, or a liquidation, these managers will be entitled to receive proceeds based on their respective holdings of ordinary B shares calculated based on the sale price. In addition, the new management incentive program includes good and bad leaver provisions in the event that a manager leaves Stonegate Group. Depending on the cause and time of leaving, managers may receive a payment between the fair market value of their investment and the initial investment cost. Stonegate Group is in the process of implementing a new management incentive program in connection with the Transaction. In connection with this management incentive program, the Class B ordinary shares previously held by certain members of Stonegate Group’s management in Midco have been exchanged for Class B ordinary shares of Stonegate Holdings, an indirect parent company of Midco and the Parent. Under the new management incentive program, the members of management will transfer the legal title to their shares held in Stonegate Holdings to a nominee. The nominee will hold the shares in Stonegate Holdings on trust for the managers, who will retain beneficial title to the shares. Further, the applicable members of management are to be also given the opportunity to purchase certain enhanced rights to their shares in Stonegate Holdings, such that the value of their shares would increase. The managers who elect to purchase the enhanced rights would pay fair market value for this increase in value of their shares. In addition, beneficial ownership in additional Class B ordinary shares are also expected to be allocated to certain senior employees of Ei Group. Stonegate Group may change the terms and conditions of its management incentive program and may introduce additional measures to incentivize its management going forward. From time to time, Stonegate Group may also include new managers under its management incentive program.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The Supply Manager has agreed to use reasonable endeavors to supply products to tenants under the terms of the Beer Supply Agreement. In consideration of these nominations, the Supply Manager pays a monthly gross procurement fee to UPP in respect of the amount of products delivered to the tenant, lessee or manager (as the case may be) during the preceding period of either four or five weeks in each 52-week cycle. The gross procurement fee is equal to the volume of products supplied by or on behalf of the Supply Manager in the relevant period, multiplied by the then applicable relevant gross procurement fee figure in respect of such product. The gross procurement fee figure for each relevant period for beer and cider includes an amount (the “Product Accrual”) per unit accrued by UPP for each relevant period. The Product Accrual is equal to the relevant then applicable Product Accrual figure multiplied by the volume of the relevant product supply by or on behalf of the Supply Manager to tenants of the tied pubs. UPP uses the Product Accruals to make an annual payment to the Supply Manager. Not later than November 30 each year, UPP pays to the Supply Manager the lesser of (a) the total amount of Product Accruals paid by the Supply Manager to UPP in the preceding financial year and (b) the aggregate amount paid by the Supply Manager to tenants who receive volume related discounts in that financial year. The gross procurement fee and Product Accrual figures may be varied in line with the retail price index annually. In addition, if the Supply Manager can show that it would make a loss if it supplied products at the revised prices, a lower gross procurement fee and Product Accrual can be agreed between UPP and the Supply Manager, with the consent of the Unique Trustee.

The fee for a month comprises one twelfth of the relevant annual “Expense Amount” for each pub in the Unique Estate on the first day of the month plus estate expenses in respect of that month (and any estate expenses previously incurred and not previously reimbursed). These estate expenses include various amounts paid or incurred by the Asset Manager in respect of the Unique Estate that are not paid or reimbursed by a tenant of the relevant pubs, including rents or other sums payable under headleases, insurance premiums, payments under maintenance contracts and maintenance and repair costs. The Expense Amount was £5,910 per pub as of February 2005 and is adjusted annually on October 1 in line with the retail price index. On October 1, 2019, the Expense Amount per pub was revised to £9,120. Additionally, if the Asset Manager believes that the fees payable to it during the next 12 months will result in the Asset Manager making a loss in respect of the asset management services it provides, it may notify UPP of the fact not later than two weeks prior to the loan payment date falling at the end of September in any year and it is entitled to provide UPP with a proposal for an alternative fee rate which would result in the Asset Manager making a gross profit in respect of the services it expects to provide. Any agreement between them that results in an increased management fee requires the consent of the Unique Trustee. If 263 ----- UPP and the Asset Manager are unable to agree an alternative management fee, either of them may refer the matter to an expert. The Asset Manager has never exercised its rights described in this paragraph. The asset management responsibilities of the Asset Manager include, among other things, the letting of pub properties to prospective tenants, organizing the making of repairs and the carrying out of maintenance to the pubs and the taking of enforcement action against tenants in arrears pursuant to their leases. In addition, in accordance with the Asset Management Agreement, leases granted on or after March 24, 2016 to the Asset Manager or any affiliate or employee of the Asset Manager (the “Asset Manager Affiliate”), which from Acquisition Completion Date includes Stonegate Group companies, need to comply with certain conditions specified in the Asset Management Agreement (including, in particular, with regard to certain minimum rent requirements).

The net worth covenant requires that Net Worth (as defined below) that is tested annually by reference to the unaudited management accounts of UPP not at any time be less than £300,000,000. For these purposes, “Net Worth” is: - the sum of the carrying value of UPP’s fixed and current assets minus the book value of its liabilities; any accumulated after tax earnings (minus any accumulated losses) minus accumulated dividends paid by UPP to UPI; any fully subordinated financial indebtedness of UPP; the amount of any value adjustments or other non-cash provisions referable to the purchases of the Unique Estate by UPP; any amount (on an after tax basis) attributable to the amortization or the writing off of costs associated with the purchase of the Unique Estate by UPP; less - the amount of any sums required by accounting principles generally accepted in the UK to be provided for taxation payable by UPP in the accounts of UPP and not provided for in such accounts of UPP excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts relating to unprovided deferred taxation on the revaluation of fixed assets.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2020. Therefore the Interest Period will be one or more days longer. The Issuer will pay interest to the holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date, as the case may be. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365. The Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. 270 ----- All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)).

If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Holders, in certain circumstances, share in the ability to direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Transaction Security Documents. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” Subject to the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have the right to remain in possession and retain control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the Transaction Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after the payment of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement or other super priority obligations would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, the New _Notes and the Note Guarantees—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will have been granted as security for the Notes and the Note Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.”_ The creditors under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Trustee for the Notes have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed Barclays Bank PLC, as Security Agent, in each case to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which the security agent is a party (including, without limitation, the Transaction Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which the Security Agent is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. 279 ----- In addition, the terms of the Transaction Security Documents themselves provide for assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without the need for a formal release (such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge) or the exclusion of certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example, assets that may not be validly pledged or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien).",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to tax; (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, Successor Company, Guarantor or their agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or (3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, purchase or redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or the existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or Note Guarantee, the enforcement of rights under a Note or Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof; (2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, required by applicable law, regulation, treaty or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from or reduction in the rate of all or part of such Tax; provided in each case the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so; 286 ----- (3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee; (4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes; (5) any Taxes imposed with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed in connection with Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”), any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction implementing or relating to FATCA or any non-U.S. law, regulation or guidance enacted or issued with respect thereto; (6) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day period); (7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment or Note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note; or (8) any combination of the above. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and if so obtained by the Payor will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. If so obtained, such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per £1,000 or €1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be. If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises, or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate without further inquiry, as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Note Guarantees, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Proceeds Loan Agreements, the Transaction Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes) excluding any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. 287 ----- The foregoing obligations of this “Additional Amounts” section will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.20,Change of Control,21.20.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all (equal to £100,000 or €100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “Change of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control _Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth_ in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control _Payment”);_ (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least £100,000 or €100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof. 288 ----- If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the purchase date will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is mailed. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any thirdparty making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the applicable series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such thirdparty will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. A Change of Control will result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”_ In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. 289 ----- The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or _substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change_ of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change in IFRS itself or a change from IFRS to a different set of accounting principles, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date. For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Parent, on the date first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility, or, at the option of the Parent, on the date of pricing, in the case of Public Debt; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premium (including tender premium), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Closing Date shall be 293 ----- calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Closing Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in pound sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the difference will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the “Excess _Proceeds,” the Parent may use any remaining “Excess Proceeds” for general corporate purposes, subject to_ the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of “Excess Proceeds,” the “Excess Proceeds” shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, or by such other method as (i) the Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, after consultation with the Parent, deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in pound sterling or euro, as the case may be based on the denomination of the applicable Notes, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as the case may be, determined as of a date selected by the Parent that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined herein). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of “Excess _Proceeds” shall be reset at zero._ Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be allocated between the Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amounts of Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition _Purchase Date”), the Parent will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of_ Notes and, to the extent they so elect, any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. The Parent will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver (or procure the mail or delivery) to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the 302 ----- Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will (via an authenticating agent) authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of £100,000 or €100,000 or in integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Parent or the Issuer to the Holder thereof. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Parent or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Parent and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after the Closing Date from Persons who are not the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £30.0 million and 6.4% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). The Parent will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Parent will comply (or procure compliance) with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or, in the case of the first trading year ending after the Acquisition Completion Date, 150 days) after the end of each trading year, a certificate signed by an authorized representative of the Parent indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and what action the Parent is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

In addition to stated interest on the New Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Stated interest income (including any additional amounts) on a New Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the New Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. Interest on the New Fixed Rate Notes will be payable in pound sterling and interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable in euros. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the United States dollar value of the interest received, determined by translating the pound sterling or euros (as applicable) received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into United States dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment. If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest (including any additional amounts) in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the United States dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period, - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). You should consult your tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. In addition, upon receipt of an interest payment on a New Note (including, upon the sale of a New Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously 360 ----- included in income), you will recognize United States source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the pound sterling or euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the United States dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above).",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

If a Floating Rate Note is issued with OID, you generally must include the OID in gross income (as foreign source ordinary income), on a constant yield to maturity basis, in advance of the receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID, if any, that you must include in income for any taxable year with respect to a Floating Rate Note will generally equal the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Floating Rate Note for each day during such taxable year on which you held that Floating Rate Note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Floating Rate Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal and interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of - the Floating Rate Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period, over - the aggregate of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Floating Rate Note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID, if any, for each prior accrual period. Under these rules, you generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. Since the Floating Rate Notes have a floating rate of stated interest, the “yield to maturity” will be determined, solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, as though a Floating Rate Note will bearinterest in all periods at a fixed rate generally equal to the rate that would be applicable to stated interest payments on a Floating Rate Note on its date of issue. To the extent the stated interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the stated interest to be accrued or paid during the accrual period based on such fixed rate on the date of issue, such difference will be accounted for United States federal income tax purposes as an adjustment to stated interest and will have no effect on the computation of OID. OID for the Floating Rate Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into United States dollars in the same manner as stated interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as described above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” You will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Floating Rate Note, the receipt of amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the United States dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). For these purposes, all receipts on a note will be viewed first, as the receipt of any stated interest payments called for under the terms of the note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as the receipt of principal. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing OID are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these rules in light of your particular circumstances. 361 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Your adjusted tax basis in the New Note generally will be your United States dollar cost for that New Note, increased, with respect to any Floating Rate Note, by any OID previously included in income. If you purchased your New Note with pound sterling or euros, your cost generally will be the United States dollar value of the pound sterling or euros paid for such New Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your New Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for pound sterling or euros, the amount realized generally will be the United States dollar value of the pound sterling or euros received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the New Notes are traded on an established securities market, pound sterling or euros paid or received will be translated into United States dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual method taxpayer, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of the New Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the New Note for more than one year. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a New Note would generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a New Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the New Note is your purchase price for the New Note calculated in pound sterling or euros, as applicable on the date of purchase and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the New Note and (ii) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the New Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis U.S. holders, the settlement date of such disposition and/or purchase, provided the New Note is traded on an established securities market).

This summary deals only with the New Notes that are held as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquires the New Notes for cash pursuant to this Offering at their ‘‘issue price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler). As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the New Notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of the following: - an individual citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a United States person. This summary is based upon provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation and does not address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or state, local, non-United States or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address: - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entity), tax-exempt entities or insurance companies; - tax consequences to persons holding the New Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle; - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar; or - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds the New Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the New Notes, you should consult your tax advisors. If you are considering the purchase of the New Notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. 359 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,312,TAX CONSIDERATIONS,312.2,Certain United Kingdom Taxation Considerations,312.2.1,Withholding Tax,"_Payments of Interest by the Issuer_ If and while the New Notes continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest by the Issuer may be made without 363 ----- withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom tax. The Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities will be treated for these purposes as listed on the Exchange where they are admitted to trading on the Exchange and are admitted to the Official List of the Exchange in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in countries in the EEA. Interest on the New Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom tax where the Issuer reasonably believes at the time the payment is made that (i) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a United Kingdom resident company or a non-United Kingdom resident company that carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-United Kingdom resident company is required to bring into account when calculating its profits subject to United Kingdom corporation tax or (ii) the person to whom the payment is made is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out in Sections 935-937 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that in either case HMRC has not given a direction, the effect of which is that the payment may not be made without that withholding or deduction. In most other cases, interest will generally be paid by the Issuer under deduction of United Kingdom tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) unless the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HMRC in respect of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty. Any premium payable on redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the United Kingdom withholding tax treatment described above. If interest were paid under deduction of United Kingdom tax (e.g., if the New Notes are not or cease to be listed on the Exchange), holders of the New Notes who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty. _Direct Assessment_ The interest has a United Kingdom source for tax purposes and accordingly may be chargeable to United Kingdom tax by direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction, irrespective of the residence of the holder of the New Notes. However, where the interest is paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax, the interest will not be assessed to United Kingdom tax in the hands of holders (other than certain trustees) who are not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom, except where the holder of the New Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency, or in the case of a corporate holder, carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom, in connection with which the interest is received or to which the New Notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent) tax may be levied on the United Kingdom branch or agency, or permanent establishment. Holders of the New Notes should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts” above would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to United Kingdom tax. However exemption from, or reduction of, such United Kingdom tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty. _Payments Under a Note Guarantee_ The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor under the terms of a Note Guarantee in respect of interest on the New Notes (or other amounts due under the New Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the New Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemption from withholding on account of United Kingdom tax in respect of securities listed on a recognised stock exchange described above in relation to payments of interest by the Issuer. Accordingly, if a Guarantor makes any such payments and they have a United Kingdom source, these may be subject to United Kingdom withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%).",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Under section 142 of the Companies Law (2020 Revision), as amended of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Law”) a creditor who has any such security over the whole, or part of, the assets of a Cayman Islands company is entitled to enforce his security without leave of the court and without reference to the liquidator, notwithstanding that a winding up order has been made with respect to the company. Fixed-charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security, including: (a) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the assets of the company available for unsecured creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them in priority to floating charge claims; (b) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is, subject to any contractually agreed restrictions, entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; and (c) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (including amounts due by the company to its employees in respect of salaries and on behalf of employees in respect of health insurance and pension contributions). Under Cayman Islands law there is a possibility that a court might recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice, as the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative.

The following paragraphs discuss potential grounds for challenge that may apply to guarantee and security interests granted by the Company. _Voidable Preference_ Under section 145 of the Companies Law every conveyance or transfer of property, or charge thereon, and every payment obligation and judicial proceeding, made, incurred, taken or suffered by any company in favor of any creditor at a time when the company is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 93 of the Companies Law with a view to giving such creditor a preference over other creditors shall be invalid if made, incurred, taken or suffered within six months immediately preceding the commencement of a liquidation of the company. A payment to a related party of the company (being a creditor which has the ability to control the company or exercise significant influence over the company in making financial and operating decisions) shall be deemed to have been made with a view to giving such creditor a preference. Pursuant to Section 93 of the Companies Law, a company shall be deemed unable to pay its debts if: (a) a creditor to whom the company is indebted for an amount exceeding one hundred dollars then due, has served on the company a demand at its registered office requiring the company to pay the sum so due, and the company has neglected to pay such sum (or otherwise to secure or compound the same to the 366 ----- satisfaction of the creditor) within three weeks of the service of such demand; (b) execution of other process issued on a judgment, decree or order obtained in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands in favor of any creditor in any proceedings instituted by such creditor against the company, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or (c) it is proved to the satisfaction of the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands that the company is unable to pay its debts. _Transactions at an Undervalue_ Under s146 of the Companies Law every disposition of property (including a mortgage or pledge) made at an undervalue by or on behalf of a company with intent to defraud its creditors (meaning an intention to willfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) shall be voidable at the instance of its official liquidator. An obligation in this context means an obligation or liability (including a contingent liability) which existed on or prior to the date of the relevant disposition and the burden of establishing an intent to defraud is on the official liquidator. Undervalue in relation to a disposition of a company’s property means (i) the provision of no consideration for the disposition, or (ii) a consideration for the disposition the value of which in money or monies worth is significantly less than the value of the property which is the subject of the disposition. In the event of a disposition being set aside on the basis that it was a transaction at an undervalue, then if the court is satisfied that the transferee has not acted in bad faith: (a) the transferee shall have a first and paramount charge over the relevant property of an amount equal to the entire costs properly incurred by the transferee in the defense of the action or proceedings; and (b) the relevant disposition shall be set aside subject to the proper fees, costs, pre-existing rights, claims and interests of the transferee (and of any predecessor transferee who has not acted in bad faith). No action or proceedings shall be commenced by an official liquidator more than six years after the date of the relevant disposition. _Fraudulent Dispositions_ Under the Fraudulent Dispositions Law (1996 Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the “Fraudulent Dispositions Law”) every disposition of property (including a mortgage or pledge) made with an intent to defraud (meaning that the intention of the transferor was to willfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) and at an undervalue shall be voidable at the instance of the creditor who is thereby prejudiced. An obligation in this context means an obligation or liability (including a contingent liability) which existed on or prior to the date of the relevant disposition and of which the transferor had notice and the burden of establishing intent to defraud is on the creditor seeking to set aside the disposition. Undervalue in relation to a disposition of a company’s property means (i) the provision of no consideration for the disposition, or (ii) a consideration for the disposition the value of which in money or monies worth is significantly less than the value of the property which is the subject of the disposition. In the event of a disposition being set aside on the basis that it was a fraudulent disposition then if the court is satisfied that the transferee has not acted in bad faith: (a) the transferee shall have a first and paramount charge over the relevant property of an amount equal to the entire costs properly incurred by the transferee in the defense of the action or proceedings (and not merely such costs as might otherwise be allowed by the court); and (b) the relevant disposition shall be set aside subject to the proper fees, costs, pre-existing rights, claims and interests of the transferee (and of any predecessor transferee who has not acted in bad faith).

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice, as the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by an English company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against such company, or security or guarantee enforced over such company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During the administration of an English company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). In addition, a secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver. The Security Agent can appoint its choice of administrator by the out-of-court route or appoint an administrative receiver if it is the holder of a qualifying floating charge (as defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the IA86). The essential characteristics of a qualifying floating charge are that (a) the charge states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) the charge must by its terms give the holder power to appoint an administrator (or an administrative receiver) and (c) the charge (or that and other charges taken together) must relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Obligor’s property. Even if the Security Agent holds a qualifying floating charge, it can only appoint an administrative receiver if one of the exceptions to the general prohibition of appointing an administrative receiver applies. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver by the Security Agent is that the Security Agent can appoint an administrative receiver under security forming part of a “capital market arrangement” (as defined in the IA86), which is the case if a party incurs debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the IA86). Once an administrative receiver is appointed by the Security Agent the company or its directors will not be permitted to appoint an administrator by the out-of-court route and a court will only appoint an administrator if the charge under which the administrative receiver appointed is successfully challenged or the Security Agent agrees. If an administrator is appointed to a company, any administrative receiver then in office must vacate office and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. 368 ----- An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). Whether the assets are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Obligor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2321,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,2321.2,England and Wales,2321.2.3,Challenges to Note Guarantees and Security,"There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and guarantees can be challenged. The following paragraphs discuss potential grounds for challenge that may apply to guarantees and security interest. _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest (in certain cases) or a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the transaction constitutes a gift or is made on terms that provide that the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or in money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the IA86). In addition the company must have been “unable to pay its debts” at the time that it granted the guarantee or security or became “unable to pay its debts” as a result. A company will be “unable to pay its debts” if a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the company and remains unsatisfied within 21 days of such service or an execution on or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a court in favor of a creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is not able to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). A court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the IA86), in which case there is a presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the IA86) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court may not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the company in deciding to give the preference was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position. If the court determines that the transaction 369 ----- was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith and for value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a victim of the relevant transaction can apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or guarantee granted by that company on the grounds the security interest or guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors. A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue and the court is satisfied the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against it or to prejudice the interest of such persons. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make such order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or protect the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the security interest or guarantees) but there is protection for a third party acting in good faith and for value without notice of the relevant circumstances. Any “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) may apply to court under this provision and not just liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the company must enter insolvency proceedings and the relevant company does not need to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction. _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if an English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a liquidator or administrator if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in the IA86). The floating charge, however, will be validated to the extent of the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the floating charge is granted to a “connected person,” the charge can be challenged if given within two years of the onset of insolvency and the prerequisite to challenge that the company is unable to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2321,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,2321.2,England and Wales,2321.2.4,Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020,"On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “Act”) enacted fundamental reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to COVID-19. The measures include the following: _(a) Moratorium_ The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium to enable the company to seek rescue options and reach an agreement with its creditors to facilitate a restructuring. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the IA86 is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements). Directors of any eligible company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. From September 30, 2020 (which may be extended by the UK government), directors must 370 ----- apply to court to commence a moratorium for any company that has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than winding up without one. Both in- and out-of-court processes involve a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among other things) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. Failure to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium will compel the monitor to end the moratorium. During a moratorium creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the leave of the monitor or the court. The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “Administration and Floating Charges” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallised during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday (save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), will have superpriority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that the qualifying conditions continue to be met. Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: i. pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement, if more than 50% (by value) of secured and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless in both cases, more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured and unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; ii. pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; iii. in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and iv. at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan. _(b) Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of termination clauses and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include winding up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than on the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. To prevent undue hardship, a supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company, the 371 ----- relevant insolvency practitioner or the court consents. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition. _(c) Restructuring Plan_ The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006, but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring. This new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the IA86, excluding certain financial market participants and any other company excluded by the Secretary of State. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a hearing. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in a convening meeting ordered by the court. At the hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and may order “out-of-the-money” creditors and members (i.e. those shown not have a genuine economic interest in the company) not to attend future meetings. Thereafter, the court may convene further stakeholder meetings, details of which must be sent to every stakeholder in that class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the relevant creditors’ or members’ meeting, and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members present, vote in favour of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favour of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favour of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: i. the court is satisfied that no creditor or member in the dissenting class(es) would be worse off than they would be in what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario, were the plan not sanctioned; and ii. the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the most likely alternative scenario referred to in (i) above. A restructuring plan confirmed by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favour of it or not. Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. If a company subsequently entered an insolvency procedure after the failure of a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any creditors bound by the failed plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency. _(d) Modification of wrongful trading_ The Act provides for a temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful trading by directors with retrospective effect from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 (subject to extension). Wrongful trading provisions create an offence for a director of a company that enters insolvent liquidation or administration to continue to trade when they knew or ought to have known prior to the commencement of the insolvent liquidation or administration that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation or administration. These temporary measures are intended to protect directors from personal liability where they make decisions to continue trading at a time when the risk of insolvency as a result of COVID-19 is high. 372 ----- Pursuant to these provisions, the court is required to assume that a director is not responsible for any worsening of the financial position of the company or its creditors that occurs during the relevant period. There is no requirement to show that the company’s worsening financial position was due to COVID-19. Other provisions aimed at preventing director misconduct (such as fraudulent trading under Section 213 of the IA86 and general fiduciary duties of directors under the Companies Act 2006) continue to apply. _(e) No winding up petitions or orders_ The Act has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a winding up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and September, 30 2020 (subject to extension) on the basis of a company’s inability to pay its debts, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that COVID-19 did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions that have been presented during this period but before the Act came into force, the court can make such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding up orders made in respect of such petitions. Similarly, no winding up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that COVID-19 had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding up orders made during this period but before the Act came into force will be void and the court can give directions to the insolvency official to restore the company to its “pre-petition” position. _(f) Statutory demands_ Under the Act, as from April 27, 2020 the presentation of a winding up petition will not be permitted on the basis of a statutory demand served during the period between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (subject to extension). This applies whether or not COVID-19 had an impact on the company’s failure to discharge the demand. _(g) So-called “Henry VIII” powers_ The Act further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations until April 30, 2021 (subject to extension). For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person’s corporate duties and liabilities. 373 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the New Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the New Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any New Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the New Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the New Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the New Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In connection with this Offering, a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the New Notes. Specifically, a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the New Notes. A stabilizing manager may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, a stabilizing manager may bid for and purchase New Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the New Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. A stabilizing manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the New Notes. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the New Notes, in which case your ability to sell the New Notes may be limited.” These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the New Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the New Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the New Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking (including hedging) and/ or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Each of Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs International, Nomura International plc, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Cöoperatieve Rabobank U.A. trading as Rabobank London, or their respective affiliates are mandated lead arrangers, original lenders and/or bookrunners under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Senior Bridge Facilities Agreement, the Senior Term Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. Barclays Bank PLC is also the agent and security agent under these agreements. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of 375 ----- investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the New Notes). The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the New Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the New Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the Initial Purchasers anticipate that they will initially purchase and hold a portion of the Floating Rate Notes for their own accounts. 376 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The condensed consolidated interim financial information consolidates those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The condensed consolidated interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with Companies Law (2013 Revision) of the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands do not have prescribed accounting standards, the Group has elected to prepare the condensed consolidated interim financial information in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the EU. The results for the current and comparative period are unaudited. A prior year restatement has been recorded to reclassify a loan to Stonegate Pub Company Holdings Limited, the ultimate parent company (see note 19), from net cash flow from operating activities to net cash flow from investing activities. The impact of the adjustment in the prior period is to reduce “Changes in receivables” and increase net cash flow from operating activities by £6 million, and increase net cash outflow from investing activities (“Loan made to ultimate parent company”) by £6 million. There has been no change to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and there is no impact on the prior period income statement or balance sheet or on the opening balances at 1 October 2018. The company’s directors expect the same adjustment to be made to the period ended 29 September 2019 (being the comparative period) in the company’s annual report and consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2020.

During the current period the Group has experienced a net cash inflow of £285 million (2019: cash outflow of £6 million) which was driven by the issue of external debt used to acquire the entire issued share capital of Ei Group Limited on 3 March 2020. The Group met its day-to-day working capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of cash generation and its £200 million combined overdraft and revolving credit facility. The Directors consider that this is a normal feature of trading in this industry. Customers pay by cash resulting in minimal credit risk and the Group takes advantage of supplier credit terms. Therefore the Group typically operates with net current assets (current period net current assets of £89 million; 2019: net current liabilities of £76 million). At the period end the Group had drawn down £175 million of its revolving credit facility (2019: £Nil) and agreed a waiver on its covenant requirements for Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 2020. At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by external debt totalling £2,978 million (2019: £745 million), details of which are set out in note 15. As a result of the acquisition on 3 March 2020: - Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc received a £1,450 million bridging loan; - Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited received a £450 million Senior Term Loan as well as a £400 million Second Lien Facility; and - The Group repaid its Secured Fixed and Floating Notes of £745 million and Ei Group Limited external debt of £1,209 million. F-10 ----- The financial position of the Group is set out in the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 3 which shows net liabilities of £8,550,000 (2019: £1,785,000 net assets). During the current period the Group has experienced a net cash inflow of £1,324,000 (2019: cash outflow of £21,021,000) driven by a decrease in exceptional costs compared to 2019. Exceptional costs in the current period are £1,105,000 compared to £17,958,000 in 2019 with the decrease predominantly arising as a result of there not being a discretionary exit bonus in the current period. The Group met its day-to-day working capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of cash generation and its £50,000,000 combined overdraft and revolving credit facility. The Directors consider that this is a normal feature of trading in this industry. Customers pay by cash resulting in minimal credit risk and the Group takes advantage of supplier credit terms. Therefore the Group typically operates with net current liabilities (current period net current liabilities of £107,285,000; 2019: net current liabilities of £180,759,000). In the forthcoming period the Group expects to achieve year on year pre-exceptional operating profit growth (both organically and through acquisitions) and be cash generative at an operating cash flow level and at a total cash flow level. At the period end the Group had drawn down £Nil of its revolving credit facility (2019: £4,000,000). At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by fixed and floating rate loan notes totalling £745,000,000 (2019: £595,000,000), details of which are set out in note 10.

In addition the Group are currently planning to re-finance a portion of the existing debt, however if this did not occur then the current debt structure would remain. The uncertainty due to the future impact on the Stonegate Pub Company Group of the recent COVID-19 outbreak has been considered as part of the Group’s adoption of the going concern basis. Since the closure of their estate on the 23 March 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; the Group has implemented all appropriate measures to reduce the impact on trading, including cost reduction, postponement of refurbishments and other capital expenditure projects. The Group’s latest forecasts and projections are for a period until September 2021 and are based on the phased re-opening of their estate which began on the 4 July 2020. The cash flow assumptions include a phased increase in sales over the going concern period with the assumption that all sites will be open by the end of September 2020. Current trading since 4 July 2020 is in line with these forecasts. The directors believe that although forecasting is difficult this is an appropriate approach as social distancing measures have been relaxed and people’s confidence grows. The forecasts include a delay in all non-committed capital expenditure, reduction in variable costs including staffing and taking advantage of the twelve month business rates holiday announced for the hospitality sector. In those forecasts, the Stonegate Group is able to continue trading within its existing facilities and meet it’s the requirements of its leverage covenants As such the Stonegate Group, subject to sales improving in line with expectations and venues not being required to closed again, alongside taking into account government initiatives as set out above, has the ability to remain trading for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements. Whilst the Group’s latest forecasts indicate headroom in its borrowing facilities, there is a risk of breaching the Stonegate Group’s financial covenants and exceeding credit facilities if sales levels were not to rise in line with forecasts or venues were again required to close. The Stonegate Board has also considered a number of severe but plausible downside scenarios; including if sales forecasts increased at a slower growth rate than expected or all venues were required to close again for a period of 2 months. These downside cases whilst considered severe have a significant impact on sales and cash flow and continue to be under review given current market conditions associated with COVID-19. The severe downside scenario associated with sales increasing at a lower rate than forecast, if it occurred, highlights that our borrowing facilities and leverage covenant would breach as at July 2021. If all venues were required to close again for a period of 2 months then without additional funding or further mitigating actions that both the borrowing facilities and leverage covenant would be in breach earlier. The Group continue to take actions to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on the business and would seek further covenant relaxations from its lenders if required. Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. However as set out above the events and future uncertain effect on trading arising as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, to continue realising their assets and discharging their liabilities in the normal course of business.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.37,1.5 Changes in significant accounting policies,145.37.1,,"Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the last annual financial statements. The changes in accounting policies are also expected to be reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 27 September 2020. The Group has initially adopted IFRS 16 Leases from 30 September 2019. A number of other new standards are effective from 30 September 2019 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements. IFRS 16 introduced a single, on-balance sheet accounting model for lessees. As a result, the Group, as a lessee, has recognised right-of-use assets representing its rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments. Lessor accounting remains similar to previous accounting policies. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 30 September 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2019 has not been restated – i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations. The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed below. _Definition of a lease_ Previously, the Group determined at contract inception, whether an arrangement was or contained a lease under IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. The Group now assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the new definition of a lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. It applied IFRS 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as leases. Contracts that were not identified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were not reassessed. Therefore, the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 has been applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after 30 September 2019. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices. However, for leases of properties in which it is a lessee, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and will instead account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. _As a lessee_ The Group lease properties and vehicles. As a lessee, the Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards if ownership. Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases – i.e. these leases are on-balance sheet.

The rightof-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payment made. It is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-ofuse assets recognised. _Transition_ At transition, for leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 30 September 2019. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Group applied this approach to all other leases. The Group used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17: - Applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term. - Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application. - Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.

The estimated useful lives are as follows: - freehold properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values over 50 years; - leasehold properties and improvements are depreciated over the shortest of 50 years, their estimated useful lives and their remaining lease periods; - administration furniture, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 2 to 15 years; - retail furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over 3 to 15 years; - right-of-use assets are depreciated over their lease lives; - long-life landlords fixtures and fittings are depreciated over 30 years; and - short-life landlords fixtures and fittings are depreciated over 5 years. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The group capitalises employment costs and related personal expenses of individuals whose job roles are fundamentally associated with managing or implementing the Group’s capital development programme. Judgement is therefore applied in determining the element of internal labour costs which are directly attributable to capital projects. Where such an individual undertakes non-capital expenditure related activities as part of their job roles then a proportion of their cost is not capitalised unless the non-capital expenditure related activities are incidental to their role.

A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. _Non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each CGU is reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the entire estate. The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. _Defined benefit plans_ A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/asset. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

Impairment losses Property, plant and equipment",145.79.1,,"The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment, and impairment reversals for previously impaired CGUs. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the higher of the expected net realisable value or the value in use. On 20 March 2020, all pubs and restaurants were mandatorily closed under government instruction due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This closure is considered to be a significant indicator of impairment of property, plant and equipment. As a result a full impairment review of all of the Group’s property, plant and equipment has been performed by comparing recoverable amount to its carrying values. Any resulting impairment relates to sites with poor trading performance, where the output of the calculation is insufficient to justify their current net book value. Value in use calculations use forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 8.0% (2019 52 weeks 8.15%). At 12 April 2020, the value in use calculations include as estimate of the impact of expected closure period and subsequent build up in trade post reopening, as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Impairments totalling £23,633,000 (2019: £4,226,000) were identified. In relation to the Stonegate and EI Managed pubs a sensitivity analysis has been performed on the property estate which considers the impact of forecast trading cash flows which is the most sensitive assumption. This analysis considers this change with other assumptions unchanged, in practice one change in assumption may be accompanied by a change in another. If there was a further years delay in the build up in trade post reopening as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the impairment charge would increase by £1 million. If the discount rate was to increase by 1%, the impairment charge would increase by £8 million. In relation to the Publican Partnerships and Commercial properties the assumption is that the rental payments will continue to be collected from the publicans and this will continue to support carrying value of the properties. However, if this were not the case, a resulting 5% reduction in the carrying value of these properties would increase the impairment charge by £143m.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.80,Goodwill,145.80.1,,"Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. For this purpose, the goodwill is allocated to the pub estate being a group of CGUs, as this represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. On 20 March 2020, all pubs and restaurants were mandatorily closed under government instruction due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This closure is considered to be a significant indicator of impairment of goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill has been compared to its recoverable amount and involved calculating an overall value in use, using discounted cash flow projections. The value in use calculation is based on forecast earnings before interest and taxation over a five year period, taking into accounts the impact of expected closure period and subsequent build up in trade post reopening, as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 8.0% (2019 52 weeks 8.15%). Management has estimated the discount rate by reference to past experience and an industry average weighted cost of capital as adjusted for appropriate risk factors reflecting current economic conditions and the risk profile of the CGUs. The calculation is most sensitive to changes in assumptions used for forecast cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate. Given the uncertainty surrounding future trading levels as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, several scenarios have been modelled. Although not considered probable, if there was a further years delay in the build up in trade post reopening as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic or a 1% rise in the discount rate, no impairment would be recognised.

Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and a company whose ultimate parent company is Stonegate Pub Company Limited, received a senior term loan of £450,000,000 on 3 March 2020 charging an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 5.25%. The loan matures on 12 March 2027. On 3 March 2020 Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited received a £400,000,000 second lien facility charging an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 8.5%. The facility matures on 12 March 2028. The proceeds from the issue of the loans on 3 March 2020 were used to finance the acquisition of Ei Group Limited, repay the secured fixed and floating notes (£405m and £340m respectively) and pay fees in connection with the transactions. As part of the acquisition of Ei Group Limited on 3 March 2020, the Group acquired securitised bonds of £678,020,000. These securitised bonds consist of Class A4 notes charging an annual interest rate of 5.66%, Class M notes charging an annual interest rate of 7.40% and Class N notes charging an annual interest rate of 6.46%. The securitised bonds were not repaid as part of the acquisition, therefore, in accordance with IFRS 3, they should be included on the balance sheet at fair value. As the securitised bonds are traded in an active market, a fair value of £770,535,000 was calculated based on the 2 March closing bond prices multiplied by the quantity of each bond held at the acquisition date, resulting in a fair value adjustment required of £92,515,000.

The uncertainty due to the future impact on the Stonegate Pub Company Group of the recent COVID-19 outbreak has been considered as part of the Group’s adoption of the going concern basis. Since the closure of their estate on the 23 March 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; the Group has implemented all appropriate measures to reduce the impact on trading, including cost reduction, postponement of refurbishments and other capital expenditure projects. The Group’s latest forecasts and projections are for a period until September 2021 and are based on the phased re-opening of their estate which began on the 4 July 2020. The cash flow assumptions include a phased increase in sales over the going concern period with the assumption that all sites will be open by the end of September 2020. Current trading since 4 July 2020 is in line with these forecasts. The directors believe that although forecasting is difficult this is an appropriate approach as social distancing measures have been relaxed and people’s confidence grows. The forecasts include a delay in all non-committed capital expenditure, reduction in variable costs including staffing and taking advantage of the twelve month business rates holiday announced for the hospitality sector. In those forecasts, the Stonegate Group is able to continue trading within its existing facilities and meet it’s the requirements of its leverage covenants As such the Stonegate Group, subject to sales improving in line with expectations and venues not being required to closed again, alongside taking into account government initiatives as set out above, has the ability to remain trading for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements. Whilst the Group’s latest forecasts indicate headroom in its borrowing facilities, there is a risk of breaching the Stonegate Group’s financial covenants and exceeding credit facilities if sales levels were not to rise in line with forecasts or venues were again required to close. The Stonegate Board has also considered a number of severe but plausible downside scenarios; including if sales forecasts increased at a slower growth rate than expected or all venues were required to close again for a period of 2 months. These downside cases whilst considered severe have a significant impact on sales and cash flow and continue to be under review given current market conditions associated with COVID19. The severe downside scenario associated with sales increasing at a lower rate than forecast, if it occurred, highlights that our borrowing facilities and leverage covenant would breach as at July 2021. If all venues were required to close again for a period of 2 months then without additional funding or further mitigating actions that both the borrowing facilities and leverage covenant would be in breach earlier. The Group continue to take actions to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on the business and would seek further covenant relaxations from its lenders if required. Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. However as set out above the events and future uncertain effect on trading arising as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, to continue realising their assets and discharging their liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Management periodically evaluates its estimates and judgements and bases them on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those described in the last annual financial statements, except for the new significant judgements related to lessee accounting under IFRS 16, which are described in Note 1.5.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.132,Notes to the financial statements (Continued) 1 Accounting policies (Continued) 1.5 Changes in significant accounting policies (Continued),145.132.1,,"The changes in accounting policies are also expected to be reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 27 September 2020. The Group has initially adopted IFRS 16 Leases from 30 September 2019. A number of other new standards are effective from 30 September 2019 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements. IFRS 16 introduced a single, on-balance sheet accounting model for lessees. As a result, the Group, as a lessee, has recognised right-of-use assets representing its rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments. Lessor accounting remains similar to previous accounting policies. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 30 September 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2019 has not been restated – i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations. The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed below. _Definition of a lease_ Previously, the Group determined at contract inception, whether an arrangement was or contained a lease under IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. The Group now assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the new definition of a lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. It applied IFRS 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as leases. Contracts that were not identified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were not reassessed. Therefore, the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 has been applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after 30 September 2019. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices. However, for leases of properties in which it is a lessee, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and will instead account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. _As a lessee_ The Group lease properties and vehicles. As a lessee, the Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards if ownership. Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases – i.e. these leases are on-balance sheet. However, the Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of low-value assets (e.g. IT equipment). The Group recognises the lease payments associated with the leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ‘property, plant and equipment’, the same line item as it presents underlying assets of the same nature that it owns. The carrying amounts of right-of-use assets are as below. _Significant accounting policies_ The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The rightof-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payment made. It is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-ofuse assets recognised. _Transition_ At transition, for leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 30 September 2019. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Group applied this approach to all other leases. The Group used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17: - Applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term. - Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application. - Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. _Impacts on transition_ On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognised additional right-of-use assets and additional lease liabilities, recognising the difference in retained earnings. The impact of transition is summarised below. When measuring lease liabilities for leases that were classified as operating leases, the Group discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at 30 September 2019. The weighted-average rate applied is 5.26%",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. _Non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each CGU is reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the entire estate. The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. _Defined benefit plans_ A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/asset. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Under this approach, operating lease intangibles with a net book value of £149,540,000 have been reclassified to property, plant and equipment. During the period the Group recognised a right-of use asset of £545,770,000 (after adjustments for onerous lease provisions, lease prepayments and accrued lease expenses at 30 September 2019). Included in property, plant and equipment are properties with a net book value of £312,095,000 over which the Group’s borrowings are secured by way of fixed and floating charges. Land and buildings includes £11,978,000 (2019: £11,978,000) relating to long leasehold sites; £190,243,000 of freehold land (2019: £192,324,000) and £120,993,000 of freehold properties (2019: £118,864,000). The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and impairment reversals for previously impaired CGUs. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the higher of the expected net realisable value or the value in use. Indicators of impairment were found in each of the periods ended 19 January 2020 and 20 January 2019 on a small number of individual CGUs and consequently impairment reviews were carried out on the affected CGUs. Impairments totalling £200,000 (2019: £4,226,000) were identified. F-55 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

This acquisition was financed through external debt as disclosed in Note 1.2. In response to coronavirus and the closure of all of the group’s pubs, management has taken actions to mitigate the consequential and significant impact on both profit and cash flow of this closure. These actions include reducing the group’s cash outflows in non-essential areas, accessing government’s support packages in order to safeguard employment, offering rent concessions to support our pub partnerships and strengthening both short-term and long-term financing. Financing has been accessed through the offer of private placement notes for £500 million to replace a proportion of the bridge debt acquired in March to finance the Ei acquisition, further work is on-going to replace the remaining bridge debt, alongside an increase to the revolving credit facility of £50 million for a period of two years. Furthermore the share issue will generate an additional £50 million.

They have decided to prepare the non-statutory Group accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and applicable Cayman Island company law. In preparing these non-statutory Group accounts, the directors have: - selected suitable accounting policies and applied them consistently; - made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; - stated whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU; - assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and - used the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of non-statutory Group accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities F-62 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

All audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates made by the directors, such as recoverability of goodwill and related disclosures and the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements. All of these depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the group’s future prospects and performance. Brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the UK, and its effects are subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of consequences, with the full range of possible effects unknown. We applied a standardised firm-wide approach in response to that uncertainty when assessing the group’s future prospects and performance. However, no audit should be expected to predict the unknowable factors or all possible future implications for a company and this is particularly the case in relation to Brexit.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the non-statutory Group accounts. In our evaluation of the Directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Company’s business model, including the impact of Brexit, and analysed how these risks might affect the Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. We have nothing to report in these respects. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.199,,145.199.1,,"The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and its registered office is in England and Wales. The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated in, and have their respective principal executive offices or registered offices, as applicable, in the Cayman Islands or England and Wales. All of the directors and the executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. The assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. It may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, a Guarantor or such persons or to enforce against any of the judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, and there is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales or the Cayman Islands of civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The Cayman Islands currently have no treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters with any jurisdiction (other 383 ----- than in respect of certain judgments of certain superior courts in the Commonwealth of Australia). Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Cayman Islands. However, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in U.S. federal or state courts under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) or, in certain circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief, and would give a judgment based thereon without any re-examination of the merits provided that: (a) such U.S. courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment as a matter of Cayman Islands law conflict of law rules; (b) such U.S. courts did not contravene rules of natural justice; (c) the judgment of such U.S. courts was not obtained by fraud, (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands, (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands, and (f) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands. 384 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The financial position of the Group is set out in the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 17 which shows net liabilities of £10,823,000 (2018: net assets of £1,999,000). In addition, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s key exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. During the current period the Group has experienced a net cash outflow of £7,025,000 (2018: cash inflow of £12,000,000). The net cash outflow was mainly a result of the Group’s investing activities. The Group met its day-to-day working capital requirements through its standard trading cycle of cash generation and its £50,000,000 combined overdraft and revolving credit facility. The Directors consider that this is a normal feature of trading in this industry. Customers pay by cash resulting in minimal credit risk and the Group takes advantage of supplier credit terms. Therefore, the Group typically operates with net current liabilities with this financial year seeing a decrease as a result of a refinancing on 30 January 2019 when the Group repaid its bridging loan facility and received a further £149,250,000 of floating rate loan notes (current period net current liabilities of £83,003,000 (2018: net current liabilities of £154,161,000). In the forthcoming period the Group expects to continue to achieve year on year pre-exceptional operating profit growth (both organically and through acquisitions) and be cash generative at an operating cash flow level and at a total cash flow level. At the period end the Group had drawn down £3,000,000 of its revolving credit facility (2018: £25,000,000). At the balance sheet date, the Group was financed by fixed and floating rate loan notes totalling £745,000,000 (2018: £595,000,000), details of which are set out in note 18.

The net cash inflow was a result of the Group’s operating, investing and financing activities. During the prior period Stonegate Pub Company Limited issued share capital resulting in a £40,250,000 inflow, in order to purchase Intertain Limited; carried out a £595,000,000 refinancing on 16 March 2017 and paid out a £93,871,000 dividend on 5 May 2017.

Additional disclosure requirements have been adopted to the year ending 29 September 2019 as shown in note 19. _Classification and measurement_ The adoption of IFRS 9 has had no material impact on the measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group’s financial assets and trade and other receivables, both previously classified as loan and receivables carried at amortised cost under IAS 39, continue to be carried at amortised cost under IFRS 9. The Group’s business model is to hold these assets for collection of contractual cash flow, and the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount. There are no changes to the classification and measurement for the Group’s financial liabilities. _Impairment of financial assets_ IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with an expected credit loss (ECL) model. The new impairment model applies to the Group’s financial assets that are held at amortised cost. The Group has determined that the application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirement as at 1 October 2018 has not resulted in an additional allowance for impairment and given the minimal impact on retained earnings no restatement was required.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for leases.

There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value items.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 on 30 September 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, with assets equal to liabilities. This approach will not require restatement of comparative information. When applying the modified retrospective approach to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, the Group can elect, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether to apply a number of practical expedients on transition. The Group has elected to adopt the following practical expedients on transition to IFRS 16: - not to reassess contracts to determine if the contract contains a lease and not to separate lease and non-lease elements; - where an onerous lease provision is in existence, to utilise this provision to reduce the right-of-use asset value rather than undertaking an impairment review; - to exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset; - to apply the portfolio approach where a group of leases has similar characteristics; and - to use hindsight in determining the lease term.

This will replace the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts. The Group will apply the practical expedient to rely on its assessment of onerous lease contracts under IAS 37 as an alternative to performing an impairment review at the transition date. The right of use asset will be adjusted for the value of the onerous lease provision immediately before the transition date. The onerous lease provision at 29 September 2019 is £9,814,000. An amount of £6,763,000 will be recognised as impairment as transition, with an amount of £466,000 recognised in opening retained earnings, representing the excess onerous lease provision as a result of different discount rates being used for the onerous lease provision compared to lease liabilities under IFRS 16. The remaining provision of £2,585,000 will continue to be held as a provision as it relates to non-rental elements of onerous lease provisions. No significant impact is expected for the Group’s finance leases. _Income statement_ Under IFRS 16 the Group will see a different pattern of expense within the income statement, as the IAS 17 operating lease expense is replaced by depreciation and interest charges. For the 52 weeks ending 27 September 2020, the Group’s trading profit metric will improve by an estimated £17,661,000 under IFRS 16 as the new depreciation expense is expected to be lower than the IAS 17 operating lease charge; however net finance costs are expected to be higher than this, estimated at £28,343,000, such that net profit after tax and the underlying earnings metric are expected to be materially lower compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis. For the short-term leases, of 12 months or less, and leases of low-value assets, the Group will opt to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. The expenses attributable to these leases will continue to be recognised in the income statement as operating lease expenses. _Tax impact on changes to the income statement_ The Group will follow the accounting treatment and deduct depreciation and interest expense when calculating current tax. The tax deductions are not expected to be materially different compared to the previous IAS 17 reporting basis. _Cash flow statement_ There is no net cash flow impact on application of IFRS 16, although the classification of cash flows will be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows, whereas under IFRS 16, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows, respectively. The change in presentation as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16 will see an improvement in the period ending 27 September 2020 of an estimated £28,343,000 in cash flow generated from operating activities, offset by a corresponding decline in cash flow from financing activities.

A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. _Non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the entire estate. The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. _Defined benefit plans_ A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/asset. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds. These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding projected cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary from these estimates.

The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using management experience. _Defined pension benefit schemes_ The present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are disclosed in note 24. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of retirement benefit assets / liabilities. _Business combinations_ The Group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value.

Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment, and impairment reversals for previously impaired CGUs. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the higher of the expected net realisable value or the value in use. The value in use is determined using the present value of the expected cash flows attributable to that site using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.15% (2018: 8.42%) applied to the future expected cash flows using budgeted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over a five year period, as prepared for the board. The cash flows continue to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook. The key assumptions are budgeted earnings and trading margin, which include past investments and staff costs, and have been reviewed by the board and deemed to be reasonable. Cash flows are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate for five years, after which a nil percentage growth rate is applied into perpetuity. Where a reliable estimate of the fair value less costs of sale is available and is higher than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is not impaired. Indicators of impairment were found in each of the periods ended 29 September 2019 and 30 September 2018 on a small number of individual CGUs and consequently impairment reviews were carried out on the affected CGUs. Impairments totalling £5,295,000 (2018: £2,715,000) were identified. The Group’s estimate of impairments is relatively insensitive to movements in assumptions. For those pubs where an indication of impairment was present and which led to an impairment being recognised, no greater level of impairment could have been recorded. A 10% increase in revenue in each pub would not have led to a reduction in the impairment recorded. For those pubs where an indication of impairment was present but which led to no impairment being recorded, there are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would have led to an impairment being recognised. For a small number of pubs the recoverable amount has been calculated by reference to their fair value less cost to sell. In calculating this value, the Group’s property specialists have determined an estimated market value based on their knowledge of the market place or indicative offers received.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The carrying amount of goodwill has been compared to its recoverable amount and involved calculating an overall value in use, using discounted cash flow projections. The value in use calculation is based on budgeted earnings before interest and taxation over a five year period, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 8.15% (2018: 8.42%). Management have estimated the discount rate by reference to past experience and an industry average weighted cost of capital as adjusted for appropriate risk factors reflecting current economic conditions and the risk profile of the CGUs. Cash flows are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate for five years, after which a nil percentage growth rate is applied into perpetuity. The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate. Management considers that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount rate of 1%, a reduction in growth rate of 1% or a 5% reduction in budgeted cash flow. As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation neither a 1% increase in discount rate, a 1% reduction in growth rate or a 5% reduction in cash flow would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period.

The ageing of trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date, gross of the doubtful debt provision, is as follows: There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to minimise this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an expected credit loss (ECL) provision. The Group has adopted the simplified impairment model to measure the expected lifetime credit losses on its trade receivables. Using a provision matrix the Group analyses its historic bad debt experience to create an ageing profile which it then applies to its trade receivables balance as at the reporting date. The Group writes off its trade receivables when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery of the debt. Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings have been assessed for ECLs on a general basis under IFRS 9. The Company recognises a provision on this basis when the carrying value of the asset is not supported by the collateral available. At 30 September 2019 the value of deposits held by the Group is £26 million (2018: £32 million) and by the Parent Company is £16 million (2018: £19 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables. An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.

Impairment losses on financial assets and trade and other receivables recognised in profit or loss was £131,000. IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with an expected credit loss (ECL) model. The new impairment model applies to the Group’s financial assets that are held at amortised cost. The Group has determined that the application of the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 as at 1 October 2018 has not resulted in an additional allowance for impairment and given there was no impact on retained earnings, no restatement was required. The Group’s policy for measuring the expected credit loss is described in the accounting policies, note 3, and additional disclosure in notes 20 and 22. - IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Group adopted IFRS 15 on 1 October 2018 using the modified retrospective approach without practical expedients. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue in line with the transfer of each element of promised goods or services in a contract to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those individual elements of goods or services. This core principle is delivered in a five-step model framework that involves allocating the transaction price to each performance condition within a contract. Following an assessment of the terms of contracts it enters into with customers, the Group has concluded that the adoption of the new standard does not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position, but has resulted in additional disclosure requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

For the purposes of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 28 February 2017, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 29 September 2019. A full actuarial valuation for the Yates Group Pension scheme was carried out as at 28 February 2017. For the purposes of IAS19 the actuarial valuation as at 28 February 2017, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 29 September 2019. The following tables illustrate the impact of both the Laurel Pub Pension scheme and the Yates Group Pension scheme on the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (SOCI) and the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: Analysis of amounts recognised in the SOCI in the period: The Group has agreed with the trustees of the Laurel Pub Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by the payment of annual contributions of £2,000,000 each year until 2023. The Group will meet the other annual fees and expenses (excluding the annual PPF levy) incurred by the scheme subject to a cap of £260,000 per scheme year. The Group does not expect to contribute to the Yates Group defined benefit plan in the next financial period. The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows: Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is set out below:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The Group will meet the other annual fees and expenses (excluding the annual PPF levy) incurred by the scheme subject to a cap of £250,000 per scheme year. The group is currently engaged in the latest triannual valuation relating to the year ending 28 February 2017. The Group does not expect to contribute to the Yates Group defined benefit plan in the next financial period. The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings.

The amount outstanding at 29 September 2019 was £Nil (2018: £501,000). The Group also operated a handful of public houses on behalf of entities affiliated with investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP, known as Cubitt House Limited. Purchases for these sites totalled £398,000 (2018: £377,000) and recharges were £350,000 (2018: £301,000), resulting in a balance owing from entities affiliated with investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP of £85,000 (2018: £37,000).

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2322,KPMG LLP,2322.167,25 Management Incentive Plan,2322.167.1,,"During the period; the Group established a management incentive plan to reward certain employees, including directors and managers, for their future service. Under the plan those employees will realise a gain only if there is a growth in the equity value of the business (subject to certain ‘ratchets’) and only if an exit event occurs while they are still employed by the Group. The award has been classified as equitysettled. An exit event would occur either upon an initial public offering of the Stonegate group (‘IPO’) or some other form of sale (e.g. to a trade buyer). There is inherent uncertainty in determining a suitable vesting period given that an exit event, whilst within the control of the Group’s ultimate owners, may not happen for many years if at all. However, for the purposes of considering the impact of IFRS 2, the directors consider it reasonable to use a minimum vesting period of 5 years. The scheme is operated by the Group’s ultimate owners and was established through subscription to shares in the Group’s immediate parent company. A total of 1.5 million shares have been issued at an aggregate price of £16.3 million (£10.93 per share). The scheme was established on 28 February 2019. There have been no leavers, no forfeits, no expiries, no exercises and no further grants since this point. Information on the fair value at the date of grant has been obtained through the transaction price relating to the acquisition of the Group by a new private equity fund (TDR Capital Stonegate L.P.) at fair value from the previous private equity fund (TDR Capital II). The return available to the participating employees increases at a greater rate depending on the extent of growth in the equity value. No dividends will accrue under this award. The excess of the fair value at the date of grant of the awards compared to the effective exercise price is not significant. This is based on management’s assessment that any reasonable volatility measure, the estimated vesting terms and a risk free rate of around 1% would not have a material impact on fair value. The aggregate exercise price of £16.3 million is broadly equivalent to the gross fair value arising and consequently no income statement charge has been made. There are no other share based payment schemes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

All audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates made by the directors, such as those assumptions determining the defined benefit pension liability and the impairment of property, plant, equipment and operating leases and related disclosures and the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements. All of these depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the Group’s future prospects and performance. Brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the UK, and at the date of this report its effects are subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of outcomes, with the full range of possible effects unknown. We took that uncertainty into account in our approach when assessing the Group’s future prospects and performance.

We have nothing to report in these respects. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.

On 3 March 2020 the acquisition of Ei Group plc (“the Ei Group”) by Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited (‘the acquirer’) completed and the Ei Group plc entity became a private company, Ei Group Limited. Following acquisition, the Ei Group’s debt facilities, excluding the Unique Securitisation, were repaid and replaced with an intercompany loan repayable to the acquirer on equivalent terms to the acquirer’s bridging loans (note 18). In addition, the Ei Group became an additional guarantor to the Stonegate Group’s debt facilities including the acquirer’s revolving credit facility, senior and second lien term loans and the bridging loans. As a result, the Ei Group is reliant on financial support from Stonegate Pub Company Limited. The Ei Group has received a letter of support from Stonegate Pub Company Limited which confirms their ability and that they will provide financial support to the Ei Group for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements for the period ended 28 December 2019 to assist in meeting the Ei Group’s liabilities as and when they fall due, but only to the extent that funds are not otherwise available to the Ei Group to meet such liabilities. The directors of Ei Group Limited are the same as the directors of Stonegate Pub Company Limited. The directors have reviewed the Stonegate Group’s financial resources including cash flow forecasts and covenant compliance tests for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. Since the closure of the estate on 20 March 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic the Stonegate Group has implemented appropriate measures to reduce the impact on the business, including cost reduction, accessing benefits from the Government support schemes including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the business rates relief and HMRC deferment of indirect tax, postponement of refurbishments and other capital expenditure projects. The Stonegate Group’s base case forecasts are for a period until September 2021 and are based on the phased re-opening of the estate which began on the 4 July 2020. The cash flow assumptions include a phased increase in sales over the going concern period with the assumption that all sites will be open by the end of September 2020 and trading returned to 90% of 2019 levels by January 2021 and remaining so for the rest of the going concern period. F-205 ----- The Group’s business activities, including a description of its financial position, cash flows, debt and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Strategic report on pages 01 to 43, along with a summary of factors likely to affect the Group’s future development and performance. Further details on the Group’s financial instruments and risks can be found in note 22 of the accounts on pages 118 to 125. The directors have considered the Group’s financial resources including a review of the medium-term financial plan, which includes a review of the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements along with the principal risks and uncertainties as described on pages 37 to 43. The directors have given specific consideration to going concern in light of the proposed offer for the Group as explained further in the Strategic report on page 43. Based on the outcome of the above considerations the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period under review. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. F-243 ----- The directors exercise judgement when concluding on going concern as the basis of preparation of the financial statements.

Taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, the board paper shows that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current borrowing facility. Applying reasonably possible sales based sensitivities year on year the Group’s forecasts show that it would continue to operate within its facility and within financial covenants. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Thus they adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements. _Acquisitions prior to IFRS transition date_ IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The Group elected not to restate business combinations that took place prior to transition date. In respect of acquisitions prior to transition date, goodwill is included at transition date or earlier if applicable on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised. On transition, certain items recognised as other intangibles under Adopted IFRS have been separately accounted for with appropriate adjustments against property, plant and equipment and amortisation of goodwill ceased as required by IFRS 1. money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The Group considers each of its individual pubs as a cash-generating unit. Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the individual pub is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as being the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the entire estate. The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. _Onerous lease provisions_ The Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the site is closed or for properties where rental expense is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using management experience. _Defined pension benefit schemes_ The present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are disclosed in note 24. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of retirement benefit assets / liabilities. _Business combinations_ The Group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value. The assessment of fair value, particularly for property, plant, equipment and operating leases acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market conditions. Note 12 describes the business combinations in the current and prior periods and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. completed an impact assessment and determined that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position, but will result in additional disclosure requirements. - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments—IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 2009 with a complete version issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The group has assessed the impact and determined that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position. for the foreseeable future thereafter.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (Group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

These are expected to be applied as follows: - The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and the group plans to adopt IFRS 16 in the period beginning 30 September 2019. For lessors, there is little change to the existing accounting in IAS 17 Leases. The application of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the group’s consolidated financial results and financial position. This includes recognition of interest and amortisation expense in place of fixed rental expense in the income statement and the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for its operating lease portfolio on the balance sheet. There is no net cash flow impact on application of IFRS 16, although the classification of cash flows will be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows, whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively. The group has a comprehensive project under way to assess the overall impact of adopting IFRS 16, including: determining the preferred transition approach and quantifying the financial impacts; addressing the future data collection requirements and updating processes accordingly; and integrating IFRS 16 into all its reporting with effect from 30 September 2019. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect of the initial application of IFRS 16 until this assessment project has been completed. - The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014, and amended it in April 2016. The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.

The recoverable amount is determined as being the higher of the expected net realisable value or the value in use. The value in use is determined using the present value of the expected cash flows attributable to that site using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.42% (2017: 8.4%) applied to the future expected cash flows using budgeted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over a five year period, as prepared for the board.

The Group’s estimate of impairments is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate, growth rates and budgeted cash flows. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by reference to these assumptions. This demonstrated that a 1% reduction in the growth rate, a 1% increase in the discount rate, or a 5% reduction in budgeted cash flow would not lead to an increase in the impairment charge. The minimal impact is mainly driven by factoring in the fair value less costs to sell for the CGUs.

The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: Movements in the fair value of scheme assets are as follows: Analysis of amounts recognised in the SOCI in the period: The Group has agreed with the trustees of the Laurel Pub Pension scheme that it will aim to eliminate the deficit by the payment of annual contributions of £2,000,000 each year until 2023. The Group will meet the other annual fees and expenses (excluding the annual PPF levy) incurred by the scheme subject to a cap of £250,000 per scheme year. The Group does not expect to contribute to the Yates Group defined benefit plan in the next financial period. The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows: Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is set out below: At the end of the life of the Yates Group Pension scheme, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund and any such refund would be paid out only on a net of tax basis. Movements in the present value of scheme liabilities are as follows: Interest costs are shown in finance costs and service costs and expenses are recognised in operating costs. The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows. The history of experience adjustments on the schemes for the current and previous financial periods is as follows: The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the period end were as follows: The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings, and in qualifying death in service insurance policies that cover the mortality risk. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the Yates Group Pension scheme against extreme inflation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability. A provision for onerous leases is made for sites for which future trading profits, or income from subleases, are not expected to cover rent. The provision takes several factors into account, including the expected future profitability of the pub and the amount estimated as payable on surrender of the lease, where this is a likely outcome.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2322,KPMG LLP,2322.399,1.19 Significant accounting estimates and judgements,2322.399.1,,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the period. Management periodically evaluates its estimates and judgements and bases them on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: _Impairment of property, plant, equipment and operating leases_ Property, plant and equipment and operating leases are reviewed for impairment if there are any indicators to suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations and estimated sale proceeds. These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding projected cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary from these estimates. These are disclosed in note 11. _Impairment of goodwill_ The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. The recoverable amount of all cashgenerating units (CGUs) grouped together is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding projected cash flows and the choice of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the value-in-use of those cash flows. These are disclosed in note 11. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. _Onerous lease provisions_ The Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the site is closed or for properties where rental expense is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using management experience. _Defined pension benefit schemes_ The present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are disclosed in note 23. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of retirement benefit assets / liabilities. _Business combinations_ The Group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value. The assessment of fair value, particularly for property, plant, equipment and operating leases acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market conditions. Note 12 describes the business combinations in the current and prior periods and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

These are expected to be applied as follows: - IFRS 16 Leases—IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ replaces IAS 17 and addresses the definition, recognition and measurement of leases. The key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability based on discounted future lease payments. The asset will be depreciated over its useful economic life while the lease payment will be apportioned between a capital repayment of the lease liability and a finance charge. The impact of this standard is expected to be material. The choice of transition method is expected to be significant. The standard gives the option to either fully restate or recognise an asset equal to the value of the liability on the date of transition. The impact of the standard and choices are currently being assessed and it is not yet practicable to quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements. This will be applicable to Stonegate for the financial year ending September 2020. - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers—The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts in May 2014. This standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is currently considering the impact of IFRS 15 on its consolidated results and financial position. - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments—IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 2009 with a complete version issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

The Directors have determined that these sites operate under onerous property leases and have provided the expected shortfall between operating income and rents payable for a property. The estimated period required to mitigate these losses is identified on an individual property basis. The release of the onerous lease provisions primarily relates to the successful exit of sites at a rate below originally expected. The health and safety claims provision is an estimate of the claims which the Group expects to settle over the next two years. These claims generally relate to minor incidents of personal injury at sites and the level of provision has been based on managements’ expected future successful claim rate.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2322,KPMG LLP,2322.517,Notes (Continued) 1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation (Continued),2322.517.1,,"The change in accounting policy resulted in the following adjustments being made to the opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2019: _Change to accounting policy_ Prior to the adoption of IFRS 16 leases were classified as either finance leases or operating leases. Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were retained by the lessor the lease was classified as an operating lease and the rentals paid were charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over the lease term. Following adoption of IFRS 16 a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised for all leases. The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term and lease payments made are apportioned between the interest charge and a reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised as an expense in the income statement. _Effect of IFRS 16 on the results for the 13 weeks ended 28 December 2019_ The phased opening plans to maximize profit on a site by site basis and is ongoing. For a typical managed pub, management believes that revenue in the reopening phase of 50% of 2019 levels can cover site costs and overheads. Revenue of 60-66% of 2019 levels can additionally cover interest expense. Management also has some flexibility to manage maintenance capital expenditure in the short term if required. For Publican Partnerships, management believes revenue of approximately 60% of 2019 levels may be sufficient to cover overhead costs and interest expense. Current trading since 4 July 2020 is in line with management’s base case forecasts. The directors believe that although forecasting is difficult, the phasing in the base case model represents an appropriate approach as social distancing measures are relaxed and people’s confidence to visit a venue grows. The forecasts include controllable actions such as a delay in all non-committed capital expenditure, reduction in variable costs including staffing and taking advantage of the 12 month business rates holiday announced for the hospitality sector. In the base case forecast, the Stonegate Group is able to continue trading within its existing facilities and meet covenant compliance tests. Whilst the Stonegate Group’s base case forecasts indicate headroom in borrowing facilities, there is a risk of breaching the Stonegate Group’s financial covenants and exceeding debt facilities in the going concern period if sales levels were not to rise in line with base case forecasts or a substantial proportion of the estate was again required to close in response to a potential second wave of the pandemic. The Stonegate Board has also considered severe but plausible downside scenario reverse stress tests. Under the reverse stress tests sales growth was reduced by 10% compared to the base case and a second scenario was modelled where all venues were required to close again for a period of two months. These downside cases, whilst considered severe, have a significant adverse impact on sales and cash flow and continue to be under review given current market conditions associated with Covid-19. The severe downside scenario associated with sales growth reducing at a 10% lower rate than the base case forecast, if it occurred, highlights that the borrowing facilities would be exceeded and the leverage covenant would be breached as at July 2021. If all venues were required to close again for a period of two months then without additional funding or further mitigating actions both the debt facilities and the leverage covenant would be in breach earlier than July 2021. The Stonegate Group continue to take actions to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on the business, such as applying for a CBILS government loan, completing a consent solicitation to amend the covenant terms in the Unique securitised debt and completing a refinancing to reduce the interest impact of the bridging facilities. The Stonegate Group have further mitigating actions available which have not been included in their forecasts including cash proceeds from sale of those pubs required by the CMA on acquisition of the Ei Group, further sales of packages of pubs or seeking further covenant relaxations from its lenders if required. Based on the above, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. However as set out above the events and future uncertain effect on trading arising as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Stonegate Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not contain the adjustments that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Segmental analysis,2322.528.1,,"The Group has five distinguishable operating segments being Publican Partnerships, Commercial Properties, Bermondsey Pub Company, Craft Union Pub Company and Managed Investments which reflect the different nature of income earned, types of property and profile of customers. The five segments have been identified because the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews discrete financial information relating to them. Operating segments are aggregated when they have similar economic characteristics and therefore Bermondsey Pub Company, Craft Union Pub Company and Managed Investments have been combined as they represent income earned from the direct operation of pubs albeit through differing trading styles. This results in three reportable segments being Publican Partnerships, Commercial Properties and Managed.

This treatment is expected to apply for five years following the implementation of the Pubs Code which will allow for a full cycle of rent reviews over which time the Group will assess the optimal location for each asset which may include the payment of an assignment premium to allow the Group access to the property. In the year to 30 September 2019, £5 million (2018: £nil) of costs have been committed and incurred in relation to the proposed acquisition of the Group. These primarily relate to adviser, legal and professional fees and have been allocated to non-underlying as they are one-off in nature. In the prior year restructuring costs of £1 million were incurred as we concluded the reorganisation of a number of support teams to meet our future needs and these charges were allocated to non-underlying as they were one-off in nature. A tax credit of £1 million (2018: £1 million) has been recognised in relation to these costs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

In the prior year, on 14 March 2019 the Group completed on the disposal of a portfolio of 348 properties and their associated non-licensed premises in a transaction to a subsidiary of Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP. Following this, and as part of the original agreement, a further six leasehold properties were also disposed to this purchaser during August and September 2019. All properties were trading within the commercial properties segment. The total net cash proceeds from the sale of £341 million were predominantly used to reduce debt. The loss on disposal of the transaction of £6 million includes fees of £4 million and a provision for future capital payments of £2 million.

A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the estate. On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999 which led to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax of £330 million. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and changes in the rate of UK tax, the movement is recognised in the income statement. The current rate of corporation tax is 19%, however the Government announced in March 2016 a reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 17% by 1 April 2020 which was enacted during a prior year. Deferred taxation has been calculated based on the current enacted rate of 17% (13 weeks ended 29 December 2018: 17%). A deferred tax credit of £1 million (13 weeks ended 29 December 2018: £1 million, year ended 30 September 2019: £3 million) relating to the movements in valuation of the estate and related assets and net profit/(loss) on disposal of property has been recognised in the income statement. A non-underlying tax credit of £nil (13 weeks ended 29 December 2018: £nil, year ended 30 September 2019: £8 million) has been recognised in relation to all other non-underlying items in the income statement.

Post balance sheet events,2322.576.1,,"On 3 March 2020 the acquisition of the Company by Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited completed and on the same day Company reregistered as a private company. Contingent professional fees incurred in relation to this transaction of £13 million became payable. Further to this transaction on 4 March 2020, £525 million of corporate bonds were repaid at par and on 6 March 2020 a further £500 million of corporate bonds were repaid at par. On 11 March the drawn balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was repaid and the facility was cancelled and then on 12 March 2020 the £150 million unsecured corporate bond was repaid at 107.1% of its par value. On committing to repay, all unamortised fees in relation to these liabilities are charged to the income statement. These repayments were funded by way of an intercompany loan from Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited on equivalent terms to the acquirers bridging loans, which range from 5.25% to 9.75% above LIBOR and for a period of five to eight years. In addition, the Ei Group became an additional guarantor to the Stonegate Group’s debt facilities including the acquirer’s revolving credit facility, senior and second lien term loans and the bridging loans. On 20 March 2020 the UK Government enforced the closure of all pubs as part of the efforts to control the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the situation it is difficult to quantify the impact Covid-19 could have on the financial performance of the Group, however, it is expected there will be a significant reduction in performance for the next 12 months. The Group has been working proactively and continues to do so to protect cash flow through a number of actions including suspension of the capital programme and reduction of costs across the business. The managed business has seen no sales during the period of lockdown, however 98% of staff have been furloughed and with the help of the business rates relief, costs have been minimised during the same period. The Publican Partnerships and Commercial Properties segments have been impacted to a lesser degree as although leased and tenanted drink income has been impacted, rents have continued to accrue, although collection has been deferred, with £5 million of rent credited to those publicans who did not receive a government grant. Rent concessions have been made for July and August of 75% and 50% respectively to support our publicans and on 4 July 2020 c.80% of the Company’s pubs reopened. Sales are expected to be lower than budget in the short-term however we expect to gradually see them return to more normalised levels as consumer confidence increases and certain safety measures are relaxed. The directors are also mindful that a second lockdown is a possibility and have ensured that learnings from the first could be applied to any future closures to mitigate cost. Whilst the reopening of the country following this period of lockdown remains in the early stages it is noted that the speed of the recovery is uncertain and therefore there is a risk that there could be a material adverse change in the value of some assets on the balance sheet, for example goodwill which totals £37 million, property, plant and equipment which totals £3,344 million and investment property which totals £107 million as a result of future impairment. These constitute non-adjusting events in accordance with the applicable accounting standard and any change in value will be reflected in the following period’s financial statements. The events and future uncertain effect on trading arising as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern (note 1).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; - state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

This has resulted in a goodwill impairment of £232m being recorded resulting in a total carrying value of £37m (2018: £304m). Of the £37m remaining balance of goodwill, £nil relates to Ei Publican Partnerships (2018: £248m), £7m (2018: £31m) to Ei Commercial Properties and £30m (2018: £25m) to the three Ei Managed segments.

The valuation is performed by a combination of internal and external appropriately qualified valuers (as described in note 17). The valuation has been performed by third party independent valuers for 96% of the properties by value (2018: 95%). The risk is the overvaluation of the Group’s property assets as a result of: - The use of valuation multiples above normal market ranges; and/or - Where FMT per outlet for the pub estate / ERV for the investment property estate differs from actual income outside the expected range dependant on the lease profile of the asset. to the members of Ei Group plc We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures regarding property assets in line with IAS 16, IAS 40 and IFRS 13. to the members of Ei Group plc to the members of Ei Group plc to the members of Ei Group plc We determined materiality for the Group to be £5.9m (2018: £6.0m), which is 5% (2018: 5%) of underlying profit before tax.

The going concern basis of preparation is dependent upon the availability of such debt facilities and related covenant tests being met for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approving the financial statements. Furthermore, as a result of the cash offer for the shares of Ei Group plc by Stonegate Pub Company (Stonegate), which was approved by Ei Group plc’s shareholders on 12 September 2019 and is subject to Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approval, the risk in regard to going concern has increased. As discussed in the Strategic report (page 43), this is because, if approved by the CMA, the takeover is expected to complete within the going concern review period and will trigger the change in control clauses in certain of the Group’s debt facilities resulting in the need for these to be repaid immediately. In addition, the existing Ei Group plc directors are expected to step down on completion of the acquisition.

This included recalculating and stress testing covenant compliance throughout the review period. We inspected the Group’s debt facility agreements for evidence of change of control clauses. In addition, for the Unique securitisation trust deeds, which do not include change of control clauses, we obtained management’s correspondence from their lawyers confirming there would be no requirement to repay this debt. We obtained the signed financing agreements from the acquirer. We agreed the funding within these agreements to management’s model prepared to demonstrate that the acquirer had sufficient funding in place to cover the cash acquisition and related costs as well as the repayment of the Group’s facilities that include change of control clauses. We recalculated management’s cash flow forecasts and covenant compliance tests for the enlarged group including sensitivity analysis of future cash flows from operating activities. We read the information in the public domain in respect of the acquirer’s future intentions for the business. We obtained a direct confirmation from the acquirer that these remain an accurate representation of Stonegate’s intentions and inspected the representation letter provided by the acquirer to the current directors in respect of the future funding, operations and profitability of the Group post acquisition. We considered management’s disclosures in respect of both going concern and viability to ensure appropriate explanation of the circumstances was given. Goodwill was included wholly within that part of the audit subject to full scope procedures. We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of the controls operated by the Group surrounding the goodwill allocation and impairment process. We confirmed that the operating segments represented the appropriate level to perform the goodwill impairment review and that no further sub-analysis was required. We ensured that management had appropriately determined the carrying amount of goodwill for each CGU and tested the basis for any movement of goodwill between segments. We checked the discounted cash flow workings to ensure they were clerically accurate. We examined the cash flow forecasts by testing the underlying models, which included an analysis of the underlying assumptions, and by reference to the accuracy of previous forecasts and underlying assumptions. We also confirmed the forecasts were consistent with the Board approved forecasts and those used in the going concern and viability assessments. The key assumptions of the discount rate and long-term growth rate underlying the goodwill impairment test were addressed through a combination of testing the Group’s detailed calculations, benchmarking the assumptions used against comparator companies and external forecasts and, in respect of the discount rate assumption, an independent assessment by our valuation specialists based on general market indicators. We recalculated the goodwill impairment to confirm the amount and allocation to CGUs was appropriate. For the remaining goodwill, we have considered if there were any further indicators of impairment. We ensured the appropriate disclosures were included in the Annual Report and Accounts. The entire property estate valuation was subject to full scope procedures. We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of the controls operated by the Group over the valuation process. We inspected management’s assessment of the estate valuation, in particular, their considerations and conclusions with regard to the appropriateness of the values determined by the external valuers. Together with our internal property valuation specialists, we met with the Group’s internal and external valuers in order to understand market trends, the overall estate valuation movement as well as specific trends within the year end valuation. We challenged the method adopted, the derivation of the key inputs of fair maintainable trade and FMT/ERV multiple (as described in note 17) and the nature and extent of the work they performed in preparing the valuations. Together with our internal property valuation specialists, we evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of management’s external and internal valuation experts. The source data provided by the Group to the external and internal valuation experts for the EIPP and EICP estate (consisting of drink barrelage, drink income and rental income by property), was tested back to underlying invoices for a sample of 60 transactions. The source data for the Managed estate (consisting of EBITDA by property) was agreed to underlying financial records for a sample of 52 properties. We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the valuation models. We performed risk specific sampling: - Where the multiples applied did not fall within our expected ranges as informed through: historically achieved ranges by region; yields achieved through observable market transactions in the period; and overall trends in yields in the market as assessed by our internal property valuation specialists. - Where, for the pub estate, movements in the FMT to actual income gap was inconsistent with underlying changes in the lease agreement profile. - Where, for the investment property estate, the ERV applied in the valuation showed a material difference to the actual rental value achieved in the year. - We also selected a random sample of assets to add unpredictability into our sampling approach. We used data analytics as a risk assessment procedure over the whole estate to direct our testing towards those assets which displayed one or more unusual features either in their underlying performance or in their valuation outcome. We sampled properties where our overall property analytics identified outliers within the estate. From our risk specific sampling and analytics procedures, we identified 203 (2018: 206) asset valuations for follow up. For the items identified we obtained explanations from the internal and external valuers as well as from the Director of FP&A where relevant for the valuation movement and/or FMT/multiple. With the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we tested these explanations by corroborating changes in factual circumstances to relevant source documentation and historic trading performance.

We ensure that management had appropriately determined the carrying amount of the investment and audited the discounted cash flow workings to ensure they were clerically accurate. We examined the cash flow forecasts by testing the underlying models, including analysis of the underlying assumptions, and by reference to the accuracy of previous forecasts and underlying assumptions.

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2322,KPMG LLP,2322.596,Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee,2322.596.1,,"On a standalone basis the forecasts support the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from signing the financial statements. On the assumption the acquisition completes, the acquirer has sufficient funding in place to cover the cash acquisition, associated costs and would be able to repay the Group’s debt facilities that would be withdrawn on a change of control. Management’s cash flow forecasts for the enlarged group support the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from signing the financial statements, taking into account assurances received from the acquirer that they have no intentions to make material changes that would adversely impact the ongoing group. We consider management’s disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts to be appropriate in regards to the assumptions over going concern (being that the assessment is prepared on the assumption that operation of the Group, its distributions to shareholders and its financing arrangements under new ownership would be no less favourable than is currently envisaged on a standalone basis). We consider management’s disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts to be appropriate in regards to the assumptions upon which the viability assessment has been made (being the new board would continue to operate and finance the business and make distributions to shareholders with no material adverse impact to the Group’s forecasts). Following review and challenge, management have recorded an impairment of goodwill of £232m resulting in goodwill of £37m remaining as at 30 September 2019. We recalculated the goodwill impairment to confirm the amount and allocation to each CGU was appropriate. For the remaining goodwill no further indicators of impairment were identified. A pre-tax discount rate of 8.5% has been applied in the impairment tests for all segments and is within our acceptable range. The reduction in the assumptions for long-term growth rates are reflective of external forecasts. The short-term forecasts are consistent with those approved by the Board and management have demonstrated that their forecasting process is historically accurate. The valuers have adopted an approach to the valuation of the Group’s properties which is appropriate, consistent, and in accordance with applicable guidance. The results of our procedures support the overall valuation outcome and we identified no material overstatement of property values. Following review and challenge management have recorded an impairment of Parent Company investments of £793m resulting in a balance of £968m as at 30 September 2019. We recalculated the investment impairment to confirm the amount was appropriate and for the remaining balance no further indicators of impairment were identified.

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. The Group has common financial systems, processes and controls covering its operations with the exception of eight of the Group’s managed house operations which are managed on stand-alone systems maintained by third party managers. Two of these eight operations are subject to specific scope procedures. We assessed the risk of material misstatement to the financial statements, and ensured we had adequate coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 28 (2018: 27) reporting components of the Group. We performed an audit of the complete financial information of three (2018: four) full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. We performed audit procedures on specific balances in respect of five (2018: three) specific scope components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. These reporting components accounted for 99% (2018: 95%) of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, 97% (2018: 97%) of the Group’s Revenue and 99% (2018: 100%) of the Group’s total assets. The audits of the entities subject to full and specific scope audits (which represent the principal business units within the Group, one being the Parent Company itself) are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group materiality appropriate to the relevant scale and risk of the business concerned. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to these components was £0.9m to £3.1m (2018: £0.9m to £3.2m). Of the remaining 20 components that together represent 1% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review; review of group wide entity level controls; testing of consolidation journals; intercompany eliminations; and the assessment of control in accordance with IFRS 10; to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. Our approach was as follows: - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant framework is the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, in particular the new Statutory Code of Practice. - We understood how the Group complying with this framework by making inquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures, and the Company Secretary and through the review of the pubs code compliance report submitted to the Pubs Code Adjudicator. We corroborated our enquiries through review of board minutes, review of internal audit reports and papers provided to the Audit Committee. - We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management and the Audit Committee to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. In addition, we also performed specific procedures to respond to our fraud risks of overstatement of wet, dry, food and amusement income through manual journal postings, and the risk of fraud as a result of management override (through inappropriate classification of items as non-underlying or through the classification of expenditure between capital or expense). Such procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from material fraud or error. - Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations that we considered could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements. Our procedures included a review of board minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations, a review of papers provided to the Audit Committee by internal audit on compliance with regulations and enquiries with the Director of Internal Audit, management and the Company Secretary.

Presentation of financial statements (Continued),2322.663.1,,"- IFRS 16—Leases IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that appropriately represents those transactions. It requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less. The standard requires an entity that is a lessee to recognise a right of use asset and a lease liability based on the net present value of the payments required under each of its leases. The operating lease charge, currently recognised in EBITDA, is replaced by the depreciation of the right of use asset and interest on the lease liability. As well as a change to the line items in the income statement it also changes the profile of the net charge recognised in the income statement over the lease term. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard, whereby the lessor continues to classify leases as finance or operating leases, however, the standard prescribes that the sub-lease of an asset held on a lease is categorised as a finance lease or an operating lease with reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease. The expected impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the balance sheet as at 1 October 2019 is estimated to be as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2322,KPMG LLP,2322.665,Impact of adoption,2322.665.1,,"On adoption the Group is expected to recognise a right of use asset of £215 million and a financial asset of £9 million (including the existing intangible operating lease premium asset of £8 million) with a corresponding lease liability of £281 million. The right of use asset of £215 million is net of an impairment provision based on an impairment test carried out on adoption. A balance of £5 million in prepayments in relation to lease payments made immediately prior to adoption is expected to be released along with the existing onerous lease provision of £6 million and an overdue rent review provision of £5 million. The net balance of £59 million is expected to be recognised in the opening profit and loss reserve. The deferred tax effect of the above balance recognised in the opening profit and loss reserve is estimated to be £10 million. EBITDA in the financial year ending 30 September 2020 is expected to increase by approximately £21 million being the operating lease payments previously recognised as an expense within EBITDA net of a reduction in rental income for those properties that have been identified as sub-let on finance leases. Depreciation and amortisation is expected to increase by £10 million reflecting the deprecation of the right of use asset resulting in a net increase to operating profit of £11 million. Finance costs will increase by a net £15 million resulting in an overall net decrease to profit before tax of £4 million. There is no net cash impact of the adoption of IFRS 16, however, the standard prescribes that where operating lease payments were previously categorised as operating cash flows the payments will be split between the principal portion and the interest element with both to be presented within cash flows from financing activities. The change in presentation is expected to result in an improvement to operating cash flows of £21 million, the corresponding decrease being in financing cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

At 30 September 2015 goodwill was allocated to individual properties based on their relative value at that time, and on disposal of a property, this attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the Group’s operating segments.

The Group’s licensed land and buildings recognised in property, plant and equipment, are revalued each year by external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an expense in the income statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is recognised in the income statement as an expense. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Landlord’s fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings and short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions in the form of long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and additions to short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over the useful economic life. Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years. Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight line basis to residual value. Property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where any indicators are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the income statement.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use provided that use was physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible to access. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. IFRS 13 requires that all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: - Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2—Other techniques whereby the inputs are either directly or indirectly derived from market data. - Level 3—Inputs used in the valuation are not based on observable market data. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously. Tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity. Otherwise tax is charged in the income statement. Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In order to calculate deferred tax on balances held by the Group it must make a judgement at each balance sheet date as to when a deferred tax asset is likely to be realised or when a deferred tax liability is likely to be settled to determine the rate at which tax should be calculated. As the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities the Group uses judgement to determine the need for a tax provision. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment. If the Group has determined that a tax provision is required whilst a formal resolution is being reached with tax authorities it recognises a provision which requires estimation. The Group will use the information and circumstances it has available to it at the time to best estimate the quantum of any provision required. The Group also uses fair value as its estimate for realisable value in calculating the deferred tax on the property estate. F-255 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Non-underlying items (Continued) e) Finance costs,2322.733.1,,"During the year ended 30 September 2019, £1 million of unamortised fees relating to the term loan have been recognised in non-underlying finance costs following the extinguishment of this financial liability. There is no cash impact in the year from this write off. Furthermore, following the disposal of a portfolio of commercial properties the proceeds that related to the sale of commercial properties within the Unique securitisation were used in the full prepayment of the Class A3 Notes and part prepayment of the Class A4 Notes together with the associated costs. These costs of £14 million (2018: £nil) have been recognised as a non-underlying finance costs and have been fully paid. In the prior year, Unique securitised bonds with a nominal and book value of £4 million were purchased and cancelled for the equivalent price of £1.14 for each £1 of outstanding nominal value, generating a loss of £1 million. Also in the prior year the Group concluded a consent solicitation exercise to amend certain terms within the Unique securitisation documents to allow greater flexibility over disposals of pubs that are not subject to the tie. This has been accounted for as a non-substantial modification and the total costs and cash outflow of £4 million have been included in the carrying value of the Unique bonds. Furthermore, on 14 August 2018 the Group completed an increase and two-year extension of its £140 million existing revolving credit facility (RCF). The new maximum facility is £150 million and it is now available until August 2022. This has been accounted for as a non-substantial modification and the total costs and cash outflow of £1 million have been included in the carrying value of the RCF. On 25 September 2018 the Group issued a new £150 million bond and at the same time a tender offer for the £97 million outstanding convertible bonds. The proceeds of the bond were received on 25 September 2018. The bond has a fixed coupon of 7.5% and is repayable in March 2024. The costs incurred of £4 million (£2 million cash outflow in the prior year and £2 million cash outflow in the current year) have been included in the carrying value of the debt. In the prior year a tender offer for the convertible bonds was issued resulting in £95.4 million of the bonds being redeemed at a premium of 107% of their par value. Of the premium and fees associated with the tender offer totalling £7 million, £5 million was charged to the income statement in non-underlying finance costs in the year ended 30 September 2018, whilst £2 million was recognised in the other reserve representing the equity element of the redemption. On 27 September 2018 the Group issued an optional redemption notice to redeem the remaining £1.6 million of convertible bonds at par. This was completed during the year ended 30 September 2019.

Underlying earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for the effects of non-underlying items net of tax, divided by the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury. The dilution adjustments for share options and the convertible bonds are reviewed independently and where they are anti-dilutive to the calculation of basic diluted earnings per share they are not included in the calculation of either basic diluted and underlying diluted earnings per share. Following redemption of 98% of the nominal value of convertible bonds during the prior year with the remaining balance being redeemed during the current year, a pro-rated number of shares has been taken into account in the consideration of whether they are dilutive. For the year ended 30 September 2019, the adjustment for share options is assessed as being anti-dilutive (2018: dilutive) which has resulted in an adjustment to the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year of nil shares (2018: 5.4 million shares). For the year ended 30 September 2019, the adjustment for the convertible bonds is assessed as being antidilutive (2018: dilutive) which has resulted in an adjustment to (loss)/profit in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of £nil (2018: £5.7 million) for the post tax interest cost associated with the convertible bonds and an adjustment to the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the period of nil shares (2018: 50.1 million shares).",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

1065_1,Final Offerings 2020.md,2322,KPMG LLP,2322.754,Impairment testing,2322.754.1,,"Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. At 30 September 2019 the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments described in note 4. Within these segments the goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment to the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Within each segment value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flows over a three year period, as prepared for the Board, adjusted to reflect the current segmentation of the estate. The three year cash flows continue to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook and are adjusted to reflect the forecast level of disposals. The key assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections and levels of working capital required to support trading. Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable. Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using a growth rate identified as appropriate for each segment. The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the best publicans, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The forecast cash flows are then discounted to give a value in use. Based on external market trends the long-term growth rate used in the value in use calculation has been updated in the current year. The growth rate for the Publican Partnerships segment was 0.75% (2018: 2.00%), Commercial Properties segment was 1.50% (2018: 2.00%), Bermondsey Pub Company was 1.00% (2018: 2.00%), Craft Union Pub Company was 1.00% (2018: 2.00%) and Managed Investments was 1.00% (2018: 2.00%). The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of the highest three market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from four advisers at the year end date. The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from peer group data. Management have then given further consideration to market indicators identified following the Stonegate Offer specifically the willingness of shareholders to realise their investment now at a discount to the net asset value of the Group. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2019 was therefore increased to 8.5% (2018: 7.8%), this has been reviewed and considered appropriate for each operating segment as risk factors are considered to be similar. As at 30 September 2019, based on the updated inputs the impairment test has resulted in a total impairment of goodwill of £232 million (2018: £nil). This represents the full goodwill balance allocated to Publican Partnerships of £228 million and an impairment of £4 million recognised against the balance of goodwill allocated to the Bermondsey Pub Company segment. The carrying value of goodwill remaining represents Publican Partnerships £nil (2018: £248 million), Commercial Properties £7 million (2018: £31 million), Bermondsey Pub Company £2 million (2018: £5 million), Craft Union Pub Company £22 million (2018: £16 million) and Managed Investments £6 million (2018: £4 million). In the prior year there was headroom within the Publican Partnerships segment of £786 million and the growth rate needed to reduce to 0.2% or the pre-tax adjusted discount rate increase to 9.3% before any impairment was identified. Within the Bermondsey Pub Company segment, the remaining balance of goodwill would be impaired if the growth rate reduced to 0.8% or the discount rate increased to 8.7%. In the prior year there was headroom within the Bermondsey Pub Company segment of £23 million and the growth rate needed to reduce to below zero or the pre-tax adjusted discount rate increase to 9.5% before any impairment was identified.

With the exception of properties identified for disposal and transferred to non-current assets held for sale, the Group’s properties were revalued as at 30 September 2019 by GVA Grimley Limited (t/a Avison Young) or Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP, independent Chartered Surveyors, or by the internal Estates Director, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor. For further analysis of the pubs valued by valuer see table below. All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market observable inputs. Property assets held in property, plant and equipment were valued using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) capitalised at an appropriate rate of return (as defined within RICS Valuation—2017 Global Edition) or an equivalent multiple. This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future trading potential. This assessment of profit is then capitalised at an appropriate multiple to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market transactions. The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed landlord’s fixtures and fittings. The valuation of the managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent approach that effectively capitalises the net income attributable to the Group from operating the pub at an appropriate multiple.

Property fair value measurements (Continued),2322.773.1,,"Property assets held in investment property include free-of-tie pubs let to tenants at open market rents and non-pub assets, which are predominantly blue-chip let convenience stores. These assets have been valued adopting the investment method of valuation. By reference to the rents, fixed lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value. All classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. IFRS 13 prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a higher and better use. In the current year the highest and best use of all the property assets in property, plant and equipment and investment property has been assessed as their existing use. The impact of the Group revaluation is as follows: 2019** 2018 £m** £m The table below presents, by class of property, the income and multiple bandings within which the properties have been valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings. In determining the bandings to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property, but has concluded that the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this forms the most appropriate disclosure. A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the overall valuation of the estate. Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the valuers are illustrated below:",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The growth rate used in the calculation has reduced in line with the goodwill calculation and was 0.75% (2018: 2.00%). The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of the highest three market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from four advisers at the year end date. The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from peer group data. Management have then given further consideration to market indicators identified following the Stonegate Offer specifically the willingness of shareholders to realise their investment now at a discount to the net asset value of the Group. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2019 was therefore increased to 8.5% (2018: 7.8%). This has resulted in an impairment of £793 million (2018: £29 million) resulting in the carrying value of investments at 30 September 2019 being £968 million (2018: £1,761 million). As an assessment of theoretical sensitivities to this impairment review calculation, an increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would result in a further impairment of £55 million (2018: £115 million) or a decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate used would result in a reduction in the impairment of £59 million (2018: headroom of £97 million). Similarly an increase of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result in a reduction in the impairment of £58 million (2018: headroom of £109 million) or a decrease of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result in a further impairment of £55 million (2018: £126 million).

Financial assets and liabilities (Continued),2322.809.1,,"Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases, as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. The fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings, evaluated to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 3, is not deemed to be materially different to the nominal value if it had been determined by using the discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at 30 September 2019 was also assessed to be insignificant. The nominal, book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below: The book value of financial assets and liabilities includes unamortised fees, fair value adjustments made on acquisition and excludes the value ascribed to the equity element of the convertible loan note. Subject to the terms, the bond was convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which were automatically transferred to the Parent Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Parent Company. The bond converted at a premium of 35% to the share price on 10 September 2013 of 141.5p, which means that the bond was convertible based on an exchange share price of 191.0p into 50.8 million ordinary shares. The exchange share price would have been adjusted on the happening of certain events, including the payment of a dividend. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for convertible financial instruments, the proceeds received from the convertible bond issue were split, with an initial £75 million recorded as a liability and £22 million recorded within equity, stated net of costs of £2 million and £1 million respectively. The difference between the effective interest charged and the actual interest paid is added to the liability element over the life of the convertible bonds. On 26 September 2018 the Group redeemed and cancelled £95.4 million of the convertible bonds at a purchase price of 107% of their par value. On 27 September 2018 the Group issued an optional redemption notice to redeem the remaining £1.6 million of convertible bonds at par. This was completed during the year ended 30 September 2019. On 25 September 2018 the Group issued a £150 million unsecured corporate bond with a coupon of 7.5% maturing in 2024. Although the holders of these bonds have no security over Group properties they do benefit from a shared share pledge over Unique Pubs Limited. This objective is achieved through the following processes: - regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function; - regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile; and - maintenance of undrawn bank facilities. The proportion of nominal value of borrowings comprised: Details of undrawn borrowing facilities available at 30 September are as follows: be a requirement to add more properties to the security of the corporate bonds and any addition of new properties must be completed within 90 days of the year end. There is sufficient headroom on both of these covenants. There are no new covenants under the unsecured bond. There are two covenants that relate to the securitised bonds which are tested at each quarter end. These covenants are based solely on the assets held within the securitised bonds and comprise a net asset covenant and a debt service cover covenant. There is sufficient headroom in both of these covenants. The Group tests all of the above covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting process. These are reviewed at Board level.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax.

As such the below should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments. If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would increase by £1 million (2018: £nil) and the interest payable would increase by £nil (2018: £nil).

Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of the option. For the LTIP the expected life of an option is based on historical data. The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; - state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors’ report (including the corporate governance report) and the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Each of the directors, whose names and functions are disclosed on page 41, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge: - the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Group; and - the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

The valuation is performed by a combination of internal and external appropriately qualified valuers (as described in note 18). The valuation has been performed by third party independent valuers for 95% of the properties by value (2017: 95%). The risk is the over-valuation of the Group’s property assets as a result of the use of valuation multiples above normal market ranges or where FMT for the pub estate and ERV for the commercial property estate differs from actual income outside the expected range dependant on the lease profile of the asset. As a result of continued uncertainty over the impact of the MRO legislation and the UK economy, we consider the risk of material misstatement to remain consistent with the prior year. to the members of Ei Group plc to the members of Ei Group plc The short-term forecasts are consistent with those approved by the Board and management have demonstrated that their forecasting process is historically accurate. to the members of Ei Group plc The Company has investments with a total carrying value of £1,761 million (2017: £1,790 million) in subsidiaries which are subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with IAS 36. The impairment test is sensitive to the key assumptions of discount rate, the level of forecast cash flows (including longterm growth rate assumptions) and the results of the estate valuation exercise, as described in note 19. to the members of Ei Group plc Of the remaining 20 components that together represent 1% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review; review of Group-wide entity level controls; testing of consolidation journals, manual journals, and intercompany eliminations; and the assessment of control in accordance with IFRS 10; to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements. The audits of the entities subject to full and specific scope audits (which represent the principal business units within the Group, one being the Parent Company itself) are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group materiality appropriate to the relevant scale and risk of the business concerned. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to these components was £0.9 million to £3.2 million (2017: £0.9 million to £3.2 million). The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 95% (2017: 99%) of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, 97% (2017: 99%) of the Group’s revenue and 100% (2017: 99%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 77% (2017: 91%) of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, 78% (2017: 88%) of the Group’s revenue and 99% (2017: 99%) of the Group’s total assets.

We corroborated our enquiries through review of board minutes, review of internal audit reports, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies. - We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. In addition, we also performed specific procedures to respond to our fraud risks of overstatement of wet, dry, food and amusement income through manual journal postings, and the risk of fraud as a result of management override (through inappropriate classification of items as non-underlying or through the classification of expenditure between capital or expense). Such procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. - Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations that we considered could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements. Our procedures included a review of board minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations, a review of papers provided to the Audit Committee by internal audit on compliance with regulations and enquiries with the Director of Internal Audit, management and the Company Secretary. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. to the members of Ei Group plc Notes: 1. The maintenance and integrity of the Ei Group plc web site is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site. 2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. F-314 ----- to the members of Ei Group plc - The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 91% of underlying profit before tax, 88% of revenue and 99% of total assets. - The components subject to specific scope procedures or specified procedures covered the remainder of underlying profit before tax (8%), revenue (12%) and total assets (1%). Materiality** - Overall Group materiality of £6m represents 5% of underlying profit before tax. to the members of Ei Group plc earnings multiple (as described in note 18) and the nature and extent of the work they performed in preparing the valuations. We assessed the valuers’ conclusions regarding the continued uncertainty over the impact of MRO and the UK economy on the valuation of the property estate. For the movement in the value of the estate as a whole, the movement in the value of appropriate sub divisions of the estate, and where necessary, the movement in the value of individual assets, we sought explanations ensuring these were consistent with our expectations. In order to select a sample focused on those asset valuations we considered to be most at risk of misstatement, we analysed features including the trading performance of the individual asset and the nature of the rent agreement. Utilising bespoke analytics over the whole estate, sorted by valuer, we highlighted those classes of assets, or individual assets, where the movement in value was inconsistent with our expectations. Particular focus was placed on assets where the multiple applied was higher than our expected range (informed through historically achieved ranges by region, multiples achieved through observable market transactions in the period and trends in yields from external data sources); where movements in the FMT-actual income gap were not congruent with underlying changes in the lease agreement profile of the assets or where the ERV applied in the valuation was materially different to the actual rental value. We also selected a random sample of assets to add unpredictability into our sampling approach. From this analysis, we selected a sample 125 (2016: 91) asset valuations which were representative of the movements in value that were inconsistent with our expectations. For our sample, we obtained explanations for the movements identified from the internal and external valuers. We agreed changes in factual circumstances to relevant documentation. to the members of Ei Group plc The key assumptions of the discount rate and long-term growth rate underlying the goodwill impairment test were addressed through a combination of testing the Group’s detailed calculations, benchmarking the assumptions used against comparator companies and, in respect of the discount rate assumption, an independent assessment by our specialists based on general market indicators. to the members of Ei Group plc to the members of Ei Group plc opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. The Group has common financial systems, processes and controls covering its operations with the exception of ten of the Group’s managed house operations which are managed on stand-alone systems maintained by third party managers. These ten operations are subject to specified procedures. We assessed the risk of material misstatement to the financial statements, and ensured we had adequate coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 24 (2016:19) reporting components of the Group. We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four (2016: four) full scope components, performed specific scope procedures in respect of three components (2016: seven) and performed specified procedures in respect of 17 components (2016: eight). The audits of the entities subject to full and specific scope audits (which represent the principal business units within the Group, one being the Parent Company itself) are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group materiality appropriate to the relevant scale and risk of the business concerned. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to these components was £0.9m (2016: £0.9m) to £3.2m (2016: £3.1m). Of the remaining 17 components that together represent 1% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review; review of Group wide entity level controls; testing of consolidation journals, manual journals, and intercompany eliminations; and the assessment of control in accordance with IFRS 10; to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of the controls operated by the Group surrounding the valuation process. We inspected managements’ analysis over the estate valuation documenting their conclusions with regard to the appropriateness of the external valuations. Together with our internal property valuation specialists, we met with the Group’s internal and external valuers in order to understand market trends, the overall estate valuation movement as well as specific trends within the year end valuation. We challenged the method adopted, the derivation of the key inputs of fair maintainable trade and FMT/ERV multiple (as described in note 18) and the nature and extent of the work they performed in preparing the valuations. Together with our internal property valuation specialists, we evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of management’s external and internal valuation experts. We tested the source data provided by the Group to the external and internal valuation experts back to invoices for a sample of 60 transactions. We also tested the arithmetical accuracy of the valuation models. We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures regarding property assets in line with IAS 16, IAS 40 and IFRS 13. We used analytics as a risk assessment procedure over the whole estate to direct our testing towards those assets which displayed one or more unusual features either in their underlying performance or in their valuation outcome. We sampled properties where our overall property analytics identified outliers within the estate. We also performed risk specific sampling: - Where the multiples applied did not fall within our expected ranges as informed through: historically achieved ranges by region; yields achieved through observable market transactions in the period; and overall trends in yields in the market as assessed by our internal property valuation specialists. - Where, for the pub estate, movements in the FMT-actual income gap was not congruent with underlying changes in the lease agreement profile. - Where, for the commercial property estate, the ERV applied in the valuation showed a material difference to the actual rental value achieved in the year. - We also selected a random sample of assets to add unpredictability into our sampling approach. From this analysis, we selected a sample of 206 (2017: 125) asset valuations and obtained explanations from the internal and external valuers as well as from the Director of FP&A where relevant for the valuation movement and/or FMT/multiple. With the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we tested these explanations by corroborating changes in factual circumstances to relevant source documentation and historic trading performance. F-305 ----- Goodwill was included wholly within that part of the audit subject to full scope procedures. We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of the controls operated by the Group surrounding the goodwill allocation and impairment process. We ensured that management had appropriately determined the carrying amount for each CGU and tested the basis for any movement of goodwill between segments. We confirmed the cash flow forecasts were consistent with those approved by the board and examined the cash flow forecasts by testing the underlying models, which included an analysis of the underlying assumptions, and by reference to the accuracy of previous forecasts and underlying assumptions. The key assumptions of the discount rate and long-term growth rate underlying the goodwill impairment test were addressed through a combination of testing the Group’s detailed calculations, benchmarking the assumptions used against comparator companies and, in respect of the discount rate assumption, an independent assessment by our valuation specialists based on general market indicators. We ensured the appropriate disclosures are included in the Annual Report and Accounts. The deferred tax liability is wholly within the components subject to full scope audits. We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of the controls operated by the Group surrounding the recognition of the deferred tax liability arising on the valuation of the estate. We stratified the components of the deferred tax liability into categories based on the risk factors identified within the risk wording above. With the support of our tax specialists we re-performed the full proof of tax through independently re-calculating the impact of each stratification being indexation, capital loss restrictions, DRE claims, rollover relief, and the result of the annual revaluation exercises across the estate.

We selected a sample of 75 (2016: 72) assets across the estate. With support from our tax specialists, we re-performed the calculation of deferred tax to validate the integrity of the model utilised by the Group to calculate deferred tax on the estate valuation. We re-performed the overall proof of tax prepared by management on a performance statement basis and compared movements in the year with our expectations. We investigated representative assets to validate the movement. Company investments were in scope for the Parent Company financial statements. We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of the controls operated by the Company surrounding the investment impairment review. We examined the cash flow forecasts by testing the underlying models, including analysis of the underlying assumptions, and by reference to the accuracy of previous forecasts and underlying assumptions.

The results of our procedures have affirmed the overall valuation outcome and we identified no material overstatement of property values. We concur with management that no impairment of goodwill needs to be recorded. The pre-tax discount rate of 7.75% applied in the impairment tests for EiPP and EiCP is within our acceptable range, albeit towards the lower end. The pre-tax discount rate of 7.75% applied in the impairment tests for the Managed segments (Bermondsey, Craft Union and Managed Investments) is outside of our acceptable range however no impairment would result from applying a discount rate towards the lower end of our acceptable range. Management’s discount rate of 7.75% is in line with comparable companies. The assumption for a long-term growth rate of 2% applied to all segments is consistent with external economic forecasts for the UK pub industry as well as comparable companies. F-306 ----- The process for deriving the deferred tax liability in respect of the estate has resulted in liabilities which are fairly stated. We are satisfied that the deferred tax movements have been recorded in the relevant performance statements. We concur with the investment impairment of £29 million recorded in the year. The pre-tax discount rate of 7.75% applied in the impairment test is towards the low end of our acceptable range. The assumption for long-term growth rate of 2% is consistent with external economic forecasts for the UK pub industry and comparable companies. The short-term forecasts are consistent with the current trading performance of UPP. The valuers have adopted an approach to the valuation of the Group’s properties which is appropriate, consistent, and in accordance with applicable guidance. The valuation of the properties falls within our acceptable range and we identified no material overstatement of property values. The pre-tax discount rate of 7.8% applied in the impairment tests for Ei Publican Partnerships and commercial property is towards the low end of our acceptable range. The assumption for long-term growth rate of 2% is consistent with economic forecasts. The short-term forecasts are consistent with those approved by the board and management have demonstrated that their forecasting process is historically accurate. The process for deriving the deferred tax liability in respect of the estate has resulted in liabilities which are fairly stated. We concur with management that no impairment needs to be recorded in respect of the carrying value of the Company investments. The pre-tax discount rate of 7.8% applied in the impairment test is towards the low end of our acceptable range. The long-term growth rate of 2.3% is higher than the Group rate of 2% but is consistent with the higher quality of the subsidiary’s estate.

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. F-312 ----- The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. Our approach was as follows: - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant framework is the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, in particular the new Statutory Code of Practice. - We understood how Ei Group plc is complying with this framework by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures, and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through the review of board minutes, review of internal audit reports, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies. - We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. In addition, we also performed specific procedures to respond to our fraud risks of overstatement of wet, dry, food and amusement income through manual journal postings, and the risk of fraud as a result of management override (through inappropriate classification of items as non-underlying or through the classification of expenditure between capital or expense). Such procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. - Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations that we considered could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements. Our procedures included a review of board minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations, a review of papers provided to the Audit Committee by internal audit on compliance with regulations and enquiries with the Director of Internal Audit, management and the Company Secretary. This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Presentation of financial statements (Continued) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted,904.91.1,,"During the year ended 30 September 2018 the Group has adopted the following amendments to existing standards, these have not had a material impact on the Group: - IAS 12: Income Taxes Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses -amendment to IAS 12 - IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure initiative—amendment to IAS 7 Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, which is the year ended 30 September 2019 for the Group, although earlier application is permitted: - IFRS 2—Share-Based Payments Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions—amendments to IFRS 2. The amendment clarifies the accounting around cash-settled share based payment transactions and those with net settlement features. - IFRS 9—Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and liabilities. The standard also introduces a new impairment model for financial assets and new rules for hedge accounting. The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and is not expecting any significant impact or material adjustment to opening balances from the adoption of the new standard on 1 October 2018. - IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue in line with the transfer of each element of promised goods or services in a contract to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those individual elements of goods or services. This core principle is delivered in a five-step model framework that involves allocating the transaction price to each performance condition within a contract. Following an assessment of the terms of contracts it enters into with customers the Group has concluded that the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position, but will result in additional disclosure requirements. Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 which is the year ended 30 September 2020 for the Group: - IAS 12: Income Taxes IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments issued. The Interpretation sets out how to determine the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. - IFRS 16—Leases IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that appropriately represents those transactions. It requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less. On adoption the Group will recognise a right of use asset and a lease liability based on the net present value of the payments required under each of its leases. The operating lease charge, currently recognised in EBITDA will be replaced by the depreciation of the right of use asset and interest on the lease liability. As well as a change to the line items in the income statement it is also expected to change the profile of the net charge recognised in the income statement over the lease term. The Group has made good progress on its transition project however it is not currently practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the full impact of the standard at this stage.

At 30 September 2015 goodwill was allocated to individual properties based on their relative value at that time, and on disposal of a property, this attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the Group’s operating segments.

Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an expense in the income statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is recognised in the income statement as an expense. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Landlord’s fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings and short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions in the form of long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and additions to short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over the useful economic life. Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years. Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight line basis to residual value. Property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where any indicators are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and value in use.

The new maximum facility is £150 million and it is now available until August 2022. This has been accounted for as a non-substantial modification and the total costs and cash outflow of £1 million has been included in the carrying value of the RCF. On 25 September 2018 the Group issued a new £150 million bond and at the same time a tender offer for the £97 million outstanding convertible bonds. The proceeds of the bond were received on 25 September 2018. The bond has a fixed coupon of 7.5% and is repayable in March 2024. The costs incurred of £4 million (£2 million cash outflow in the year) have been included in the carrying value of the debt. The tender offer for the convertible bonds resulted in £95.4 million of the bonds being redeemed at a premium of 107% of their par value. Of the premium and fees associated with the tender offer totalling £7 million, £5 million has been charged to the income statement in non-underlying finance costs, whilst £2 million has been recognised in the other reserve representing the equity element of the redemption. On 27 September 2018 the Group issued an optional redemption notice to redeem the remaining £1.6 million of convertible bonds at par. This was completed subsequent to the year end on 12 November 2018. In the prior year, on 24 October 2016 the Group replaced its existing £138 million RCF with a new £120 million facility. Furthermore, on 14 March 2017 the £120 million non-amortising RCF was increased in size to £140 million on the same terms. The facility was available through to August 2020 and attracted an interest rate of 3% above LIBOR applicable to any drawn portion of the facility. In addition in the prior year, on 4 November 2016 the Group completed a partial refinancing of the 2018 corporate bond. The partial refinancing resulted in a lower interest coupon and an extended debt maturity. Prior to the refinancing £350.5 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The Group received and accepted tender instructions for £250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 111% of their principal amount. In connection with this partial refinancing the Group issued new £250 million secured corporate bonds, due in February 2022, at a coupon of 6.375%, which resulted in a reduction of the corporate bonds maturing in 2018 to £100.5 million. The new issue benefited from a security package on substantially the same terms as the 2018 bonds. The total cash outflow arising from the bank and bond refinancing in the prior year was £32 million, being £28 million in respect of the repurchase premium on the extinguished bond, which was charged to the income statement, and total fees and disbursements of £4 million, of which £2 million was charged to the income statement and £2 million arising on the new bank facility was deferred over the life of the new debt instrument. Furthermore on 19 September 2017 the Group signed a new £50 million term loan facility, available for drawing until December 2018 with repayment of the amount drawn due by July 2020 which resulted in £1 million of fees that were deferred over the life of the new facility.

F-340 ----- Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. At 30 September 2017 the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments described in note 4. Within these segments the goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment to the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the Publican Partnerships segment was £271 million (2016: £296 million) with the balance allocated to the Commercial Properties segment of £24 million (2016: £18 million) and Managed segment of £17 million (2016: £7 million). Within each segment value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flows over a three year period, as prepared for the Board, adjusted to reflect the current segmentation of the estate. The three year cash flows continue to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook and are adjusted to reflect the forecast level of disposals. The key assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections and levels of working capital required to support trading. Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable. Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate in operating income (2016: 2%) which was selected as prudently below the Group’s estimate of the long-term average growth rate. The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the best publicans, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The forecast cash flows are then discounted to give a value in use. The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at the year end date. The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from peer group data. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2017 was 7.8% (2016: 8.0%), this has been reviewed and considered appropriate for each operating segment as risk factors are considered to be similar. As at 30 September 2017, the headroom on the impairment test is £717 million (2016: £686 million) for the Publican Partnerships segment, £74 million (2016: £58 million) for the Commercial Properties segment and £254 million (2016: £101 million) for the Managed segment.

IFRS 13 prescribes that the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a higher and better use.

The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to minimise this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. F-350 -----,N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases, as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. The fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings, evaluated to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 3, is not deemed to be materially different to the nominal value if it had been determined by using the discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period.

Financial assets and liabilities (Continued),904.222.1,,"The nominal, book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below: The book value of financial assets and liabilities includes unamortised fees, fair value adjustments made on acquisition and excludes the value ascribed to the equity element of the convertible loan note. guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations (including payments) in respect of the bond. The obligations of the Parent Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated, unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. Subject to the terms, the bond was convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which were automatically transferred to the Parent Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Parent Company. The bond converted at a premium of 35% to the share price on 10 September 2013 of 141.5p, which means that the bond was convertible based on an exchange share price of 191.0p into 50.8 million ordinary shares. The exchange share price would have been adjusted on the happening of certain events, including the payment of a dividend. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for convertible financial instruments, the proceeds received from the convertible bond issue were split, with an initial £75 million recorded as a liability and £22 million recorded within equity, stated net of costs of £2 million and £1 million respectively. The difference between the effective interest charged and the actual interest paid is added to the liability element over the life of the convertible bonds. On 26 September 2018 the Group redeemed and cancelled £95.4 million of the convertible bonds at a purchase price of 107% of their par value. On 27 September 2018 the Group issued a notice to redeem the remaining £1.6 million of the convertible bonds. Subsequent to the year end, on 12 November 2018 the remaining bonds were redeemed at par. In the prior year, on 4 November 2016 the Group completed a partial refinancing of the 2018 corporate bond. The partial refinancing resulted in a lower interest coupon and an extended debt maturity. Prior to the refinancing £350.5 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The Group received and accepted tender instructions for £250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 111% of their principal amount resulting in a £28 million repurchase premium. In connection with this partial refinancing the Group issued new £250 million secured corporate bonds, due in February 2022, at a coupon of 6.375%, resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds maturing in 2018 to £100.5 million. The new issue benefits from a security package on substantially the same terms as the 2018 bonds. On 25 September 2018 the Group issued a £150 million unsecured corporate bond with a coupon of 7.5% maturing in 2024. Although the holders of these bonds have no security over Group properties they do benefit from a shared share pledge over Unique Pubs Limited. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling.

The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax. The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets. As such the below should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.

RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of a Group reorganisation) established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999. The plan has a defined contribution and defined benefit scheme. The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The plan is governed by the employment laws of the United Kingdom which require final salary payments to be adjusted for the consumer price index upon payment during retirement. The level of benefits provided depends on a member’s length of service and salary at retirement age. The fund has a legal form of foundation and is governed by the Board of Pension Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy. In April 2014, the Trustees of the RetailLink Management Limited pension plan (the Plan) and the Company committed to a bulk annuity buy out of the defined benefit section of the Plan, crystallising a liability of £10 million payable through a deferred payment schedule over a four year period. The initial stage of this process involved the Trustees using the Plan’s defined benefit section assets to purchase a bulk annuity policy from Legal & General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS). The policies commenced with effect from 30 April 2014 and are being held as investments of the Plan.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; - state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors’ report (including the corporate governance report), directors’ remuneration report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Each of the directors, whose names and functions are disclosed on pages 40 and 41, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge: - the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Group; and - the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

The impact of this change is that all revaluation movements on investment property are recognised in the income statement, rather than impacting the revaluation reserve. Although the balance sheet amounts have been reclassified for the comparative period, a balance sheet for the year ended 30 September 2015 has not been presented as this has been assessed as not material. The impact on the income statement has also been assessed as not material and it has therefore not been restated. The new standard replaces IAS 39 and covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities and a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment to financial assets. The Group is in the process of reviewing the implications of the adoption of this standard. - IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers The new standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 which is the year ended 30 September 2019 for the Group, although earlier application is permitted. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue in line with the transfer of each element of promised goods or services in a contract to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those individual elements of goods or services. This core principle is delivered in a five-step model framework that involves allocating the transaction price to each performance condition within a contract. The Group is in the process of considering the terms of contracts it enters into with customers with regard to this framework in order to assess the effect of adopting this new standard. Based on the work carried out to date the Group currently does not expect any material changes to either revenue or profit as a result of adopting IFRS 15 however intends to conclude on this accounting within the forthcoming financial year. - IFRS 16: Leases The new standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 which is the year ended 30 September 2020 for the Group, although earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers is also applied. IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that appropriately represents those transactions. It requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less. On adoption the Group will recognise a right of use asset and a lease liability based on the net present value of the payments required under each of its leases. The operating lease charge, currently recognised in EBITDA will be replaced by the depreciation of the right of use asset and interest on the lease liability. As well as a change to the line items in the income statement it is also expected to change the profile of the net charge recognised in the income statement over the lease term. The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however, the impact will depend on the facts and circumstances at the point of adoption and upon transition choices adopted.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill has been allocated to individual properties based on a relative value and on disposal of a property, this attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are consistent with the Group’s operating segments.

The Group’s licensed land and buildings recognised in property, plant and equipment, are revalued each year by external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an expense in the income statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is recognised in the income statement as an expense. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Landlord’s fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings and short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions in the form of long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and additions to short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at five years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over the useful economic life. Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years. Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over three to 50 years on a straight line basis to residual value. Property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where any indicators are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Accounting policies (Continued),904.414.1,,"must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the property or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Licensed land and buildings held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised. Profits or losses on disposal of property are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal. b) Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised cost. This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument based on the estimated cash flows and the contractual terms of the agreement. When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing financial liability. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment and written off through non-underlying finance costs. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a modification, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining life of the modified loan. c) Convertible financial instruments The gross proceeds received from the issue of a convertible bond are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing any embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company, is included in equity and is not remeasured. The liability component is carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or the instrument’s maturity date. Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bond based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity. The difference between the interest expense calculated under the effective interest rate method and interest paid to bondholders is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bond. d) Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Parent Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium. When the Group returns surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks, consideration paid or payable for shares purchased for cancellation is deducted from equity. The Company uses contingent share purchase contracts and the obligation to purchase shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract. Any subsequent reduction in the obligation caused by the expiry or termination of a contract is credited back to equity at that time. e) Trade receivables and trade payables Trade receivables and trade payables are held at amortised cost. participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use provided that use was physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible to access. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. IFRS 13 requires that all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: - Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2—Other techniques whereby the inputs are either directly or indirectly derived from market data. - Level 3—Inputs used in the valuation are not based on observable market data. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and changes in the rate of UK tax, a debit or a credit is recognised in the income statement. This has been classified as a non-underlying tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the income statement in the same period. All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in the same performance statement as the gross item to which it relates. The effect of changes in the substantively enacted rate of tax used to calculate deferred tax is reflected in other comprehensive income to the extent it relates to revaluation surpluses therein and in non-underlying profit/loss for all other elements of deferred tax. The tax effect of all other non-underlying items is categorised as non-underlying in the income statement. described in note 23, the Group completed a partial refinancing of the 2018 corporate bond during the current year.

Furthermore, on 14 March 2017 the £120 million non-amortising RCF was increased in size to £140 million on the same terms. The facility is available through to August 2020 and attracts an interest rate of 3% above LIBOR applicable to any drawn portion of the facility. On 4 November 2016 the Group completed a partial refinancing of the 2018 corporate bond. The partial refinancing resulted in a lower interest coupon and an extended debt maturity. Prior to the refinancing £350.5 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The Group received and accepted tender instructions for £250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 111% of their principal amount.

As this segment expands the Group recognises that the value attributed to these assets is now a material balance and has consequently reclassified this balance from property, plant and equipment to investment property in the balance sheet. Although the balance sheet amounts have been reclassified for the comparative period, the impact on the income statement was not assessed as material and it has therefore not been restated.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

Investments (Continued),904.521.1,,"During the prior year the Company carried out a reorganisation of intercompany balances which included the capitalisation of a balance of £250 million due from a subsidiary undertaking. Following the reorganisation, which included the receipt from this subsidiary of a £271 million dividend, this subsidiary had no assets and therefore the Company recognised an impairment of the same value. At the year end, the Company has carried out an impairment review of its investment in the Unique sub-group which involved calculating a value in use using forecast cash flows discounted at 7.8% (2016: 8%) based on the Group’s pre-tax risk adjusted WACC and a long-term growth rate appropriate to the Unique sub-group of 2.3% (2016: 2.5%). The recoverable amount of the Unique sub-group has been assessed as £1,828 million (2016: £1,716 million), resulting in headroom of £112 million (2016: an impairment of £45 million). As an assessment of theoretical sensitivities to this impairment review calculation, an increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would result in an impairment of £15 million (2016: a further impairment of £121 million) or a decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate used would increase the headroom to £253 million (2016: remove the impairment and result in £89 million of total headroom). Similarly an increase of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result in headroom of £267 million (2016: remove the impairment and result in £104 million of total headroom) or a decrease of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result in an impairment of £28 million (2016: impairment of £136 million).

Trade and other receivables (Continued) Credit risk,904.527.1,,There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to minimise this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2017 the value of deposits held by the Group is £32 million (2016: £33 million) and by the Parent Company is £19 million (2016: £21 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables. An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.

Financial assets and liabilities (Continued),904.534.1,,"The nominal, book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below: guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations (including payments) in respect of the bond. The obligations of the Parent Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated, unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. Subject to the terms, the bond is convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Parent Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Parent Company. The bond converts at a premium of 35% to the share price on 10 September 2013 of 141.5p, which means that the bond is convertible based on an exchange share price of 191.0p into 50.8 million ordinary shares. The exchange share price is adjusted on the happening of certain events, including the payment of a dividend. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for convertible financial instruments, the proceeds received from the convertible bond issue were split, with an initial £75 million recorded as a liability and £22 million recorded within equity, stated net of costs of £2 million and £1 million respectively. The difference between the effective interest charged and the actual interest paid is added to the liability element over the life of the convertible bonds. On 4 November 2016 the Group completed a partial refinancing of the 2018 corporate bond. The partial refinancing resulted in a lower interest coupon and an extended debt maturity. Prior to the refinancing £350.5 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The Group received and accepted tender instructions for £250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 111% of their principal amount resulting in a £28 million repurchase premium. In connection with this partial refinancing the Group issued new £250 million secured corporate bonds, due in February 2022, at a coupon of 6.375%, resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds maturing in 2018 to £100.5 million. The new issue benefits from a security package on substantially the same terms as the 2018 bonds. - regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile; and - maintenance of undrawn bank facilities.

Financial assets and liabilities (Continued) Interest rate sensitivity,904.561.1,,"In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest rates. The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax. The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets. As such the below should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments. If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would increase by £nil (2016: £1 million) and the interest payable would increase by £1 million (2016: £1 million). If interest rates were to decrease by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would decrease by £nil (2016: £1 million) and the interest payable would decrease by £1 million (2016: £1 million). If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest payable in the Parent Company would increase by £nil (2016: £1 million). If interest rates were to decrease by 50 basis points the interest payable in the Parent Company would decrease by £nil (2016: £1 million). Following a group reorganisation during the prior year there are no floating rate receivables remaining in the Parent Company and therefore there is no exposure within interest receivable to movements in interest rates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

There are no covenants on the term loan facility until a loan is drawn. There are two covenants that relate to the corporate bonds (excluding the unsecured convertible bond); an asset value covenant and a net annual income covenant. At the year end there is an annual valuation of the estate and a review of the annual income for the properties secured under each of the corporate bonds. The valuation is undertaken by a firm of independent chartered surveyors. The directors certify the net annual income as part of an annual compliance exercise. In the event that property values or incomes have fallen, there may be a requirement to add more properties to the security of the corporate bonds and any addition of new properties must be completed within 90 days of the year end. There is sufficient headroom on both of these covenants. The covenants are unchanged in the new corporate bond. There are two covenants that relate to the securitised bonds which are tested at each quarter end.

Pension,904.581.1,,"The Group and the Parent Company make defined contribution payments to employees’ own pension plans and these payments are charged to the income statement as incurred. RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of a Group reorganisation) established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999. The plan has a defined contribution and defined benefit scheme. The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The plan is governed by the employment laws of the United Kingdom which require final salary payments to be adjusted for the consumer price index upon payment during retirement. The level of benefits provided depends on a member’s length of service and salary at retirement age. The fund has a legal form of foundation and is governed by the Board of Pension Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy. In April 2014, the Trustees of the RetailLink Management Limited pension plan (the Plan) and the Company committed to a bulk annuity buyout of the defined benefit section of the Plan, crystallising a liability of £10 million payable through a deferred payment schedule over a four year period. The initial stage of this process involved the Trustees using the Plan’s defined benefit section assets to purchase a bulk annuity policy from Legal & General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS). The policies commenced with effect from 30 April 2014 and will be held for the time being as investments of the Plan. Once the deferred premiums have been paid, the Trustees intend to ask LGAS to issue individual annuity policies to defined benefit section members and then wind-up the Plan, after which the Company will no longer retain any responsibilities or obligations to the members of the Plan. The deferred payment plan attracts interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%. In view of the relative insignificance of the pension scheme, both on a gross and net basis, the Group has elected to only present summarised disclosures to one decimal place in respect of the scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869

The maximum number of deferred share award shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2017. The 2016 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2017. ‡ The deferred share award for the executive directors vests in 4 years (2016: 4 years), the deferred share award for the executive management vests in two equal tranches after 2 and 3 years (2016: 2 and 3 years) and the deferred share award for the other members of the senior team vests after 4 years (2016: 4 years). - The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years. Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of the option. For the LTIP the expected life of an option is based on historical data. The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP. These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte-Carlo simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2020,869
