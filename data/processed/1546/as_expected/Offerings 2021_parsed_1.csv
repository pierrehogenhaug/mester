Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “propose,” “intend,” “continue,” “potential,” “possible,” “strive,” “seek,” “designed,” “goal,” “foreseeable,” “likely,” “unforeseen” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, time frames or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this offering memorandum in greater detail under the heading entitled “Risk Factors.” Given these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. In addition, our goals and objectives are aspirational and are not guarantees or promises that such goals and objectives will be met. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this offering memorandum. You should read this offering memorandum completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We hereby qualify our forward-looking statements by our cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. In addition to any such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to the following: - We may not realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from the Acquisition of GW. - The pending Acquisition of GW may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all; and regulatory bodies could impose certain requirements upon the combined company as a condition to approval that could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. - Failure to complete the Acquisition of GW could have a material and adverse effect on us. ----- - The indebtedness of the combined company following the consummation of the Acquisition will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of Jazz and GW prior to the announcement of the Acquisition. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company’s business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs. - Lawsuits have been filed against GW and us and other lawsuits may be filed against us and/or GW challenging the Acquisition. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed. - Our inability to maintain or increase sales from our neuroscience therapeutic area would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. - The introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products and product candidates would adversely affect sales of our oxybate products and product candidates. - The distribution and sale of our oxybate products are subject to significant regulatory restrictions, including the requirements of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or “REMS,” and these regulatory requirements subject us to risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem and Xywav. - While we expect our oxybate products, Xyrem and our newly approved Xywav, to remain the largest part of our business, our success also depends on our ability to effectively commercialize products in our oncology therapeutic area. - We face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios. - Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors may not be available for our products and we may be unable to successfully contract for coverage from pharmacy benefit managers and group purchasing organizations, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably; conversely, to secure coverage from these organizations, we may be required to pay rebates or other discounts or other restrictions to reimbursement that could diminish our sales. - The pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. - In addition to access, coverage and reimbursement, the commercial success of our products depends upon their market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community. - Delays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. - Our future success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our late-stage product candidates and, if approved, to successfully launch and commercialize those product candidates. - We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates to grow our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. ----- - Conducting clinical trials is costly and time-consuming, and the outcomes are uncertain. A failure to prove that our product candidates are safe and effective in clinical trials, or to generate data in clinical trials to support expansion of the therapeutic uses for our existing products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. - We have incurred and may in the future incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents, other intellectual property rights and related matters, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or commercialize, our products. - Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance, and such insurance coverage may have reduced policy limits and coverage, may not be sufficient to cover our potential liabilities and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain directors and officers. - Our business is currently adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic slowdown as a result of the current and potential future impacts on our commercialization efforts, clinical trial activity, research and development activities, supply chain and corporate development activities and other business operations, in addition to the impact of a global economic slowdown. - Significant disruptions of information technology systems or data security breaches could adversely affect our business. - We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products. - If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. - We have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position, and our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations. - To continue to grow our business, we will need to commit substantial resources, which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate and grow our business. - The market price of our ordinary shares has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future, and the value of your investment could decline significantly. - Risks related to GW’s dependence on the successful commercialization of Epidiolex/Epidyolex and the uncertain market potential of Epidiolex; pharmaceutical product development and the uncertainty of clinical success. - Risks related to the regulatory approval process, including the risks that GW may be unable to submit anticipated regulatory filings on the time frame anticipated, or at all, or that GW may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals of any of its product candidates, including nabiximols and Epidiolex for additional indications, in a timely manner or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

1546_1,Offerings 2021.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.10,Non-GAAP Financial Measures,1.10.1,,"SEC rules regulate the use in filings with the SEC of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA, that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Jazz believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors and potential investors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum may not comply with the SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. ----- We have included non-GAAP financial measures in this offering memorandum, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as Combined Adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations of non‐GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP metric follow the tables under “Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” In the case of Jazz, Adjusted EBITDA as included herein is calculated to determine covenant compliance under Jazz’s Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein). EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain other charges and adjustments as shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations under “Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The Combined Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by combining the Adjusted EBITDA of Jazz and GW and assuming certain expected cost synergies in connection with the anticipated Acquisition. Combined Adjusted EBITDA is not “pro forma” data prepared pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X and does not give effect, for example, to the financings to fund the Acquisition or the refinancing of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Combined Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in conjunction with the information contained in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and the related notes beginning on page 62 of this offering memorandum and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Jazz and GW incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with Jazz’s and GW’s respective consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz in this offering memorandum have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

1546_1,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"Jazz is an innovative global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing life-changing medicines that transform the lives of patients with serious diseases – often with limited or no options. We have a diverse portfolio of marketed medicines and novel product candidates, in early- to late-stage development, across key therapeutic areas. Our focus is in neuroscience, including sleep and movement disorders, and in oncology, including hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We actively explore new options for patients including novel compounds, small molecule advancements, biologics and innovative delivery technologies. Our lead marketed products are: _Neuroscience_ - **Xyrem[®] (sodium oxybate) oral solution, a product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, in narcolepsy patients seven years of age and older; - **Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution, a product that contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem, approved by FDA and launched in the U.S. in November 2020 for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in narcolepsy patients seven years of age and older; ----- - **Sunosi[®] (solriamfetol), a product approved by FDA and** the European Commission (the “EC”) and marketed in the U.S. and in Europe to improve wakefulness in adult patients with EDS associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA; _Oncology_ - **Zepzelca™ (lurbinectedin), a product approved by FDA and launched in July 2020 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy; - **Defitelio[®] (defibrotide sodium), a product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, or VOD, also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, or SOS, with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, and in Europe (where it is marketed as Defitelio[®] (defibrotide)) for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT therapy; - **Vyxeos[®] (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection, a product approved in the U.S. and in Europe (where it is marketed as Vyxeos[®] liposomal 44 mg/100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, or t-AML, or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, or AML-MRC; and - **Erwinaze[®] (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi), a product approved in the U.S. and in certain markets in Europe (where it is marketed as Erwinase[®]) for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Our strategy is focused on: - Strong commercial execution to drive diversified revenue growth and address unmet medical needs of our patients across our product portfolio including (1) with rapid adoption of Xywav in the U.S., (2) establishing Zepzelca as a treatment of choice for second line SCLC patients, and (3) Sunosi growth globally; - Expanding and advancing our pipeline with internal and external patient-centric innovation to achieve a valuable product portfolio of durable, highly differentiated programs, including the objective of launching (1) JZP-458 in the U.S. in mid-2021, if approved by FDA in a timely manner, and (2) JZP-258 for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in the fourth quarter of 2021, if approved by FDA in the third quarter; - Continuing to build a flexible, efficient, and productive development engine for targeted therapeutic conditions to identify and progress early-and mid-stage assets; and - Investing in an efficient, scalable operating model and differentiated capabilities to enable growth; and unlock further value through indication expansion and global markets. In 2020, consistent with our strategy, we continued to focus on research and development activities within our neuroscience and oncology therapeutic areas, such as our expansion into movement disorders and solid tumors, and exploring and investing in adjacent therapeutic areas that could further diversify our portfolio, such as post-traumatic stress disorders through our acquisition of SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc.’s, fatty acid amide hydrolase, or FAAH, inhibitor program. **GW** On February 3, 2021, Jazz entered into a Transaction Agreement with GW and Bidco. The Transaction Agreement provides, among other things, that subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Bidco (and/or, at Bidco’s election, Jazz and/or the DR Nominee (as defined in the Transaction Agreement)) will ----- acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of GW pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. GW is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. In over 20 years of operations, GW has established a world leading position in the science, development and commercialization of plant-derived cannabinoid therapeutics through its proven drug discovery and development processes, its intellectual property portfolio, and its regulatory, manufacturing and commercial expertise. GW’s lead cannabinoid product is Epidiolex, a pharmaceutical formulation comprising highly purified plant-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, for which it retains global commercial rights. GW initially launched Epidiolex in the U.S. in November 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome for patients two years of age and older. In July 2020, FDA expanded the approval of Epidiolex, adding a new indication of seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). FDA also approved the expansion of all existing indications, LGS, Dravet syndrome and TSC, to patients one year of age and older. LGS and Dravet syndrome are severe childhood-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes. TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes non-malignant tumors to form in many different organs and affects approximately 50,000 individuals in the United States and one million worldwide. GW has received Orphan Drug Designation from FDA and the Committee for Orphan Medical Products for TSC (it previously received the same designations for LGS and Dravet syndrome). Epidiolex is approved in Europe and launched in certain European countries (under the trade name Epidyolex) for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with LGS or Dravet syndrome, in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older. GW has a deep pipeline of additional cannabinoid product candidates that includes compounds in Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials exploring a range of therapeutic areas, with a particular focus on neurological conditions. Its most advanced pipeline asset in the U.S. is nabiximols, for which it has commenced two out of five clinical trials for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. The three other studies are expected to commence in the first half of 2021. GW believes that any one of these studies could enable a new drug application with FDA, potentially as early as the fourth quarter of 2021. GW anticipates commercializing nabiximols in the U.S. using its in-house commercial organization. Nabiximols is already approved in over 25 countries outside the U.S. for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis under the brand name Sativex. GW is advancing plans to commence an additional clinical program for nabiximols in spasticity due to spinal cord injury in 2021. It also plans on evaluating nabiximols for post-traumatic stress disorder, and the timing for a clinical trial in this condition will be assessed during 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202
1546_1,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strategic Rationale for the Acquisition,9.2.1,,"We believe that the Acquisition will create an innovative, high-growth, global biopharma leader with financial strength, including the following: - _Adding a Third High-Growth Commercial Franchise: The Acquisition enhances product diversification through the addition of a third high-growth commercial franchise for critical unmet patient needs within: (1) sleep disorders, (2) oncology, and (3) epilepsies. Specifically, the Acquisition will expand Jazz’s growing neuroscience business by adding Epidiolex, a global, high-growth childhood-onset epilepsy franchise. GW has rapidly scaled Epidiolex, achieving $510.5 million in annual sales within two years of launch and broad access to date, with more than 97% of U.S. lives covered. Epidiolex addresses significant unmet needs in the field of epilepsy and offers the potential for a substantial improvement in outcomes for patients who were previously drug resistant. The combined company will create a neuroscience leader with a global franchise and complementary therapeutic expertise, to maximize the value of Xywav[TM] (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution, Epidiolex, and other neuroscience products. - _Robust Combined Pipeline in Neuroscience and Oncology to Drive Sustainable Growth: GW’s novel cannabinoid platform will expand and diversify Jazz’s growing neuroscience pipeline. The collective ----- Jazz and GW teams will bring highly complementary expertise to a pro-forma pipeline of 18 clinical development programs across neuroscience and oncology, including in sleep, epilepsy, movement disorders, psychiatry, hematology and solid tumors. Following the close of the Acquisition, the combined portfolio will include highly differentiated assets addressing significant unmet patient needs, which, when combined with complementary commercial models, accelerates Jazz’s growth strategy. - _Shared Culture and Exceptional Talent Will Advance Mission to Transform the Lives of Patients: Jazz and GW are focused on developing life-changing medicines for people with serious diseases, often with limited or no treatment options. Jazz’s and GW’s global teams possess unique talents and expertise and have proven capability to develop and launch differentiated therapies to support often-overlooked patient populations. Both companies are guided by shared values that include integrity, collaboration, passion, innovation and pursuit of excellence, and have cultures where diversity, equity and inclusion are a priority.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202
1546_1,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Commercialized Products,9.3.1,Neuroscience Xyrem. Xyrem is a product approved by FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy,"and EDS in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Xyrem, is a formulation of the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous neurotransmitter and metabolite of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the U.S., with symptoms typically appearing in childhood. There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. While patients with narcolepsy may not experience all five symptoms, EDS, an essential symptom of narcolepsy, is present in all narcolepsy patients and is characterized by chronic, pervasive sleepiness as well as sudden irresistible and overwhelming urges to sleep (inadvertent naps and sleep attacks). Narcolepsy may affect many areas of life, including limiting a patient’s education and employment opportunities, and may lead to difficulties at work, school, or in daily life activities like driving, operating machinery or caring for children. Patients with narcolepsy may also suffer from significant medical comorbidities, including cardiac disorders, depression, suicide risk, anxiety, diseases of the digestive system and respiratory diseases. Cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness, can be one of the most debilitating symptoms of narcolepsy. Cataplexy is present in approximately 70% of patients with narcolepsy. Cataplexy can range from slight weakness or a drooping of facial muscles to the complete loss of muscle tone resulting in postural collapse. It may also impair a patient’s vision or speech. Cataplexy is often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger or surprise. Cataplexy can severely impair a patient’s quality of life and ability to function. Xyrem was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy in 2002 and was approved for EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy in 2005. In October 2018, Xyrem was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in pediatric narcolepsy patients ages seven and older. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends Xyrem as a standard of care for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS associated with narcolepsy. In an effort to reach more patients who might benefit from our oxybate products, we continue to implement initiatives such as outreach to prescribers who treat narcolepsy, physician/healthcare provider education, enhanced patient and physician support services and unbranded disease awareness programs for the public. Our marketing, sales and distribution of Xyrem in the U.S. are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which is required by FDA to mitigate the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, abuse, misuse and diversion of Xyrem. Under this REMS, all of the Xyrem sold in the U.S. must be dispensed and shipped directly to patients or caregivers through a central pharmacy. Xyrem may not be stocked in retail pharmacies. Physicians and patients must complete an enrollment process prior to fulfillment of ----- Xyrem prescriptions, and each physician and patient must receive materials concerning the serious risks associated with Xyrem before the physician can prescribe, or a patient can receive, the product. The central certified pharmacy must monitor and report instances of patient or prescriber behavior giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of abuse, misuse or diversion of Xyrem, and must maintain enrollment and prescription monitoring information in a central database. The central pharmacy ships the product directly to the patient (or caregiver) by a courier service. FDA has stated that the sodium oxybate ANDA applicants who received a waiver of the single, shared system REMS requirement will be required to communicate with our REMS. We have had exclusive agreements with Express Scripts Specialty Distribution Services, Inc., or ESSDS, the central pharmacy for Xyrem, to distribute Xyrem in the U.S. and provide patient support services related to Xyrem since 2002. In July 2020, upon expiration of the existing exclusive agreements with ESSDS, we entered into new agreements with ESSDS with a two-year term. Our current agreements with ESSDS, which expire on July 1, 2022, may be terminated by either party at any time without cause on 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party.

Xywav is a product approved by FDA for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in both adult and,"pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Xywav is an oxybate product that contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem. In January 2020, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, for Xywav for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy and in connection with this submission, redeemed the priority review voucher, or PRV, we acquired in May 2018. FDA approved Xywav for this indication in July 2020 and we commenced the U.S. launch of Xywav in November 2020. The 92% reduction of sodium translates into a reduction of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 milligrams per day for a patient prescribed an oxybate product, depending on the dose. When patients start Xywav after a sodium oxybate product, Xywav treatment is initiated at the same dose and regimen as the sodium oxybate product (gram for gram) and titrated as needed based on efficacy and tolerability. The label for Xywav, unlike Xyrem, does not include a warning to prescribers to monitor patients sensitive to sodium intake, including patients with heart failure, hypertension or renal impairment. We have U.S. patents and patent applications that relate to Xywav. Some of these patents expire in early 2033. In addition, we have patent applications that relate to Xywav for use in additional indications that would, if issued, expire between 2040 and 2041. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition where patients, by virtue of their diagnosis, are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and disease, and the impact of sodium on cardiovascular health is well established. There is also broad scientific consensus that reducing sodium consumption, which is a modifiable risk factor, is associated with clinically-meaningful reductions in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk. Given that narcolepsy is a life-long condition, we therefore believe that reducing sodium intake versus the standard of care by 92% each and every day is a significant advancement for these patients. Health care providers and patients who understand the increased risk of cardiovascular disease faced by narcolepsy patients and who have been educated on the meaningful reduction in sodium from Xyrem to Xywav cite that meaningful reduction as a key reason for prescribing or starting on Xywav. In approving Xywav, FDA approved a REMS to cover both Xywav and Xyrem. The Xywav and Xyrem REMS have the same requirements for both products and is also distributed by the central pharmacy through exclusive agreements with ESSDS. In 2020, net product sales of Xywav were $15.3 million, which represented 1% of our total net product sales. Following the U.S. launch of Xywav in November 2020, approximately 1,900 patients were taking Xywav by the end of 2020. With respect to Xyrem and Xywav in the aggregate, average active oxybate patients on therapy was approximately 15,300 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Total net product sales of Xywav were partially offset by the cost of launch related co-pay coupons and a free product program for certain qualified patients. We expect to have broad commercial payor coverage within the first six to nine months following launch. As of February 23, 2021, we have entered into agreements with various entities and have achieved coverage for Xywav for over 60% of commercial lives. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

We expect to continue the rolling launch in Europe as we secure pricing and reimbursement approvals in more European countries. OSA, commonly referred to as sleep apnea, is a highly prevalent disease, and EDS, a major symptom of OSA, is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day, resulting in unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness. Although positive airway pressure therapy, with its most common form being continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, has been shown to be an effective therapy for sleep apnea that frequently results in improvement in EDS in many patients, not all patients tolerate CPAP therapy and among those who tolerate CPAP, usage is highly variable. EDS may persist in people with OSA despite using CPAP. In 2020, net product sales of Sunosi were $28.3 million, which represented 1% of our total net product sales.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

In furtherance of our interest in and efforts to expand our oncology therapeutic area, in December","2019, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Pharma Mar, S.A., or PharmaMar, pursuant to which we obtained exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca. Zepzelca for injection (4 mg) is approved by FDA to treat adults with metastatic small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Zepzelca is approved based on response rate and how long the response lasted. Additional studies will further evaluate the benefit of Zepzelca for this use. Zepzelca was granted orphan drug designation for SCLC by FDA in August 2018. In December 2019, PharmaMar submitted an NDA to FDA for accelerated approval of Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC based on data from a Phase 2 trial, and in February 2020, FDA accepted the NDA for filing with priority review. In June 2020, FDA granted accelerated approval of Zepzelca for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. We are working closely with FDA and PharmaMar, to determine the appropriate trial design to confirm Zepzelca’s accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Jazz is committed to the further development of Zepzelca™ (lurbinectedin) to support conversion to full regulatory approval in the U.S. In October 2020, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with PharmaMar to expand our exclusive license to include rights to develop and commercialize Zepzelca in Canada. The term of the amended license agreement extends on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of: (i) expiration of the last PharmaMar patent covering Zepzelca in that country (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Zepzelca in that country and (iii) 12 years after the first commercial sale of Zepzelca in that country. We have the right to terminate the amended license agreement at will upon a specified notice period, and either party can terminate the amended license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. In December 2020, we, in conjunction with PharmaMar, announced results from the ATLANTIS Phase 3 study evaluating Zepzelca in combination with doxorubicin for adult patients with SCLC whose disease progressed following one prior platinum-containing line. The study did not meet the pre-specified criteria of significance for its primary endpoint. Key secondary and subgroup analyses favored the lurbinectedin combination arm. Patients received lurbinectedin at 2.0mg/m2 in the combination arm, which is lower than the FDA-approved dose of Zepzelca at 3.2mg/m2. Lurbinectedin monotherapy was not tested in ATLANTIS. We anticipate initiating the Phase 4 study for the Zepzelca program, with an objective to provide critical data to complement the findings from the Basket trial, which supported the accelerated approval of Zepzelca. In 2020, Zepzelca net product sales were $90.4 million, which represented 4% of our total net product sales, with Zepzelca net product sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $53.4 million. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Defibrotide, the API in Defitelio, is approved for the treatment of VOD, a potentially","life-threatening complication of HSCT, and is in development for other complications following anti-cancer treatment. Defibrotide is the sodium salt of a complex mixture of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine DNA. Defibrotide mediates its effects via interaction with endothelial cells. Non-clinical data suggest that defibrotide stabilizes endothelial cells by reducing endothelial cell activation and by protecting them from further damage. Stem cell transplantation is a frequently used treatment modality for hematologic cancers and other conditions in both adults and children. Certain conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT can damage the cells that line the hepatic vessels, which is thought to lead to the development of VOD, also referred to as SOS, a blockage of the small vessels in the liver, that can lead to liver failure and potentially result in significant dysfunction in other organs such as the kidneys and lungs. Severe VOD is the most extreme form of VOD and is associated with multi-organ failure and high rates of morbidity and mortality. An analysis of retrospective data, prospective cohort studies and clinical trials published between 1979 and 2007 found that the 100-day mortality rate in severe VOD cases is greater than 80%. The EC granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for Defitelio for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT in 2013. We commenced a rolling launch of Defitelio in European countries in 2014. In 2016, FDA approved our NDA for Defitelio for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT. We launched Defitelio in the U.S. shortly after FDA approval. We also launched defibrotide in Canada in 2017. In June 2019, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., the partner to whom we have granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize defibrotide in Japan, received marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and launched defibrotide in Japan in September 2019. Further geographic expansion occurred in July 2020 and September 2020, as Defitelio was approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Swissmedic in Switzerland, respectively, for the treatment of VOD.

Vyxeos is the first drug delivery combination product based on our CombiPlex technology platform to be approved by FDA and the EC. AML is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow, which produces most of the body’s new blood cells. AML cells crowd out healthy cells and move aggressively into the bloodstream to spread cancer to other parts of the body. AML is a relatively rare disease representing about 1% of all new cancer cases and has the lowest survival rate of any form of leukemia. Patients with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC may have a particularly poor prognosis. In 2017, we launched Vyxeos in the U.S. after FDA approved our NDA for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC.

Erwinaze (called Erwinase in markets outside the U.S.) is a biologic product used in conjunction,"with chemotherapy to treat patients with ALL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Originally developed by Public Health England, a national executive agency of the United Kingdom, or UK, Erwinaze is an asparaginase, a type of enzyme that can deprive leukemic cells of an amino acid essential for their growth. It is derived from a rare bacterium (Erwinia chrysanthemi) and is immunologically distinct from E. coli-derived asparaginase and suitable for patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived treatments. ----- For ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, Erwinaze can be a crucial component of their therapeutic regimen. Current treatment guidelines and protocols recommend switching a patient receiving _E. coli-derived asparaginase to treatment with Erwinaze if the patient’s hypersensitivity reaction to the E. coli-derived_ asparaginase is clinically meaningful, indicating that the hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in an intervention or interruption in infusion occurring in the patient’s treatment regimen. While treatment protocols for pediatric, adolescent and young adult (up to age 39) patients commonly include asparaginase, adult protocols do not. First approved by FDA under a biologics license application, or BLA, for administration via intramuscular injection in conjunction with chemotherapy, Erwinaze was launched in the U.S. in 2011. In 2014, FDA approved a supplemental BLA for administration of Erwinaze via intravenous infusion in conjunction with chemotherapy. Erwinaze was exclusively licensed to us for worldwide marketing, sales and distribution by Porton Biopharma Limited, or PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes our license to Erwinaze trademarks and manufacturing know-how, expired on December 31, 2020.

1546_1,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Our Recent Financial Performance,9.8.1,,"This preliminary unaudited estimated consolidated financial information was prepared by the Company’s management in connection with this offering of Notes, represents estimates based on information currently available ----- to the Company and is subject to change. The Company has provided estimates (and in certain cases, ranges of estimates) because the Company has yet to complete its normal review procedures for this period. The actual, reported financial information may not be within these ranges, and may differ materially from the estimates presented. In particular, the actual, reported financial information remains subject to the completion of the Company’s other quarterly closing procedures and the review of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements by Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG. As a result, investors should exercise caution in relying on this information and should not draw any inferences from this information regarding financial or operating data not provided. This preliminary unaudited estimated consolidated financial information should not be viewed as a substitute for full interim financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preliminary unaudited estimated information is not necessarily indicative of the results or financial position that may be achieved for the rest of the 2021 fiscal year or any future period. KPMG has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to any of the estimates contained herein. Accordingly, KPMG does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. As a result of the foregoing considerations and limitations, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this preliminary unaudited estimated consolidated financial information. Based on its preliminary analysis, the Company is providing the following preliminary unaudited estimated consolidated financial results and cash position as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021. _Revenues_ The Company estimates that, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, its revenues were between $605 million and $610 million representing an increase of approximately 13% to 14%, respectively, compared to $535 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in total revenues compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily related to inclusion of revenues from Xywav and Zepzelca following the launch of these products in 2020, partially offset by a reduction in Xyrem revenues as existing patients continued to transition from Xyrem to Xywav. _Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA_ For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company expects GAAP net income to be between $120 million and $124 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $158 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company estimates that, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, its Adjusted EBITDA was between $303 million and $307 million representing an increase of approximately 21% to 23%, respectively, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain other charges and adjustments as shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations table below. Adjusted EBITDA included herein is as calculated to determine covenant compliance under Jazz’s Existing Credit Agreement. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, when available; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. We believe, however, that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, potential investors. The following table reconciles estimated GAAP net income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and actual GAAP net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and actual Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2020, respectively: -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to mature five years after it is entered into and the New Term Loan Facility is expected to mature seven years after it is entered into. We expect that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, including after the consummation of the Acquisition, GW and certain of its subsidiaries. We expect the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by a first priority lien (subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions), equally and ratably with all existing and future first lien obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors, including the Notes and the related guarantees, on the collateral, as described under “Description of the Notes—Collateral and Security.” We expect that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate (in the case of the New USD Term Loan Facility) or EURIBOR (in the case of the New Euro Term Loan Facility), in each case plus a margin, and each such rate will be subject to a customary floor. We expect that the New USD Term Loan Facility will require quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof. The New Term Loan Facility will also require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. We expect to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the New Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for similar financings and which are expected to include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, under certain circumstances, we expect that financial covenants based on Jazz’s consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio will apply to the New Revolving Credit Facility.

Reconciliations of non‐GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP metric follow the tables immediately below. In the case of Jazz, Adjusted EBITDA included herein is as calculated to determine covenant compliance under Jazz’s Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein). EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain other charges and adjustments as shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations set forth below. The Combined Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by combining the Adjusted EBITDA of Jazz and GW and assuming certain expected cost synergies in connection with the Acquisition. Combined Adjusted EBITDA is not “pro forma” data prepared pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X and does not give effect, for example, to the financings to fund the Acquisition. The Combined Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in conjunction with the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and the related notes beginning on page 62 of this offering memorandum and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Jazz and GW incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with Jazz’s and GW’s respective consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz in this offering memorandum and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

While we and GW will continue to operate independently until the completion of the acquisition, the success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from successfully combining our and GW’s businesses and we plan on devoting substantial management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with GW’s so that we can fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Nonetheless, the products and technologies acquired may not be successful or continue to grow at the same rate as when operated independently or they may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. The transaction could also result in the assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities. In addition, difficulties may arise during the process of combining the operations of our companies that could result in the failure to achieve the synergies or free cash flow that we anticipate, the failure to integrate operations and internal systems, programs and controls, the loss of key employees that may be difficult to replace in the very competitive pharmaceutical field, the failure to harmonize both companies’ corporate cultures, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, collaboration partners, clinical trial investigators or managers of our clinical trials. As a result, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully within the expected timeframe or at all or may take longer to realize or cost more than expected, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The pending acquisition of GW may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all; and regulatory bodies could impose certain requirements upon the combined company as a condition to approval that could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Consummation of the acquisition is conditioned on, among other things, obtaining necessary shareholder approvals and the sanction of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could delay the receipt of the court sanction. If any condition to the acquisition is not satisfied, it could delay or prevent the acquisition from occurring, which could negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares and future business and financial results. Further, as a condition to their approval of the acquisition, regulatory bodies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined ----- business after the closing. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, changes in laws and regulations could adversely impact our post-acquisition profitability and financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

If the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement are not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: - the market price of our ordinary shares could decline; - we will be required to pay our costs relating to the transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the transactions are completed; - if the Transaction Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another acquisition, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction as attractive to us as the acquisition of GW; - we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to require us to perform our obligations under the Transaction Agreement; - we will not realize the benefit of the time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by our management to matters relating to the acquisition that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and - we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Similarly, delays in the completion of the acquisition could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the acquisition and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

Each of the complaints in the Federal Shareholder Litigation includes allegations that, among other things, the GW proxy statement omitted certain material information in connection with the Acquisition in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and one of those complaints also purports to allege claims that the members of the GW board of directors breached fiduciary duties in connection with the Acquisition, and that GW, Jazz and Bidco aided and abetted those alleged breaches. The plaintiffs seek various remedies, including injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the Acquisition unless certain allegedly material information is disclosed, rescission and/or other damages and an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Transaction Agreement, the GW proxy statement and/or the Acquisition may be filed in the future. One of the conditions to completion of the Acquisition is the absence of any applicable injunction or other order being in effect that prohibits completion of the Acquisition.

We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.” In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which may not be guarantors of the Notes or our other indebtedness.

Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes.

Under the Bankruptcy Code and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes, the guarantees or the liens securing the Notes and guarantees could be avoided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the Notes, incurred the guarantees or granted the associated liens with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following was also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent on the date of the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of the guarantees or the grant of security interests with respect to the Notes or guarantees or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of the guarantees or the grant of security interests with respect to the Notes or guarantees; - the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of the guarantees or the grant of security interests with respect to the Notes or guarantees left the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business; or - the Issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that the Issuer or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to pay such debts as they mature. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. The Issuer cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the Notes, the guarantee of such guarantor or the grant of security interests with respect to the Notes or guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s other debt. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; ----- - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of a guarantee thereof or the grant of security interests with respect to the Notes or the guarantees was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the Notes or such guarantee or subordinate the Notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the related guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes (or the guarantees) and/or you could be required to return amounts previously received. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt. Although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, this provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Furthermore, in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be commenced under the Bankruptcy Code, the Issuer could be subject to claims, with respect to any payments made within 90 days prior to the commencement of such a case or one year for any statutory “insider,” that the Issuer or any of the guarantors were insolvent at the time any such payments were made and that all or a portion of such payments, which could include repayments of amounts due under the Notes or the guarantees might be deemed to constitute a preference, under the Bankruptcy Code, and that such payments should be avoided by the bankruptcy court and recovered from the recipients for the benefit of the entire bankruptcy estate. Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holder of the Notes or the guarantees engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our or other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the Notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in a foreign jurisdiction. Your rights under the Notes and the guarantees (and, as applicable, the security documents) will thus be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. Also, the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar. In addition, while the Issuer and the guarantors will agree, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture or the Notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings, it may be difficult for holders of the Notes to effect service within the U.S. upon directors, officers and experts who are not residents of the U.S. in order to institute actions in U.S. courts predicated solely upon civil liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. There may be doubt as to the enforceability in non-U.S. jurisdictions in original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the U.S. federal or state ----- securities laws or other laws of the U.S. You should not assume that the non-U.S. jurisdictions: (a) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S.; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S. _Enforceability of U.S. judgments in Ireland_ We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. In order for a judgment of the U.S. courts to be enforced by the Irish courts, the following general requirements must be met: (i) the procedural rules of the U.S. court must have been observed and the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where, however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive. However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the U.S. courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons: (a) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money; (b) if the judgment was obtained by fraud; (c) if the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice; (d) if the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain U.S. laws which will not be enforced in Ireland; or (e) if jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Irish Superior Courts Rules.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral.,"The obligations under the Notes will be secured by a first-priority lien on certain tangible and intangible assets of the Issuer and guarantors, subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens. If we incur additional indebtedness, this may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to holders of the Notes in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our business. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any additional secured indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes offered hereby with respect to the Collateral, will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to the collateral or insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to holders of the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with this offering of Notes and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the Collateral will as of the Acquisition Date exceed the principal amount of the debt secured ----- thereby. In particular, the fair market value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the Notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Additionally, the value of the Collateral and the guarantees could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the Collateral and the guarantees and the obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations with respect to the Collateral, then interest, fees and expenses may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or initiated. Also, any use, sale, or lease or other disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding outside of the ordinary course of our business would require prior approval from the bankruptcy court and from creditors (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be materially delayed). Under the Bankruptcy Code, if a lien on the Collateral that is released or suspended under the Indenture’s terms is later reinstated, the reinstated lien would be at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer by the grantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by certain of its creditors) if the grantor were to file for bankruptcy within 90 days after the lien was granted (or, under certain circumstances, one year). See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Offering, the Notes and the Collateral—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties.” To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. In addition, the existence of certain permitted liens will cause the relevant assets to become Excluded Property (as defined under “Description of the Notes”), which will not secure the Notes or the guarantees related thereto. Additionally, the terms of the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes and additional debt that may rank equal in priority with the Notes and incur refinancing indebtedness in certain circumstances. Under the Indenture, any such additional Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture and refinancing indebtedness or other additional debt incurred in accordance with the terms of the Indenture will rank equal in right of payment with the Notes and be entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt and refinancing indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the Notes from the then existing pool of Collateral. Releases of Collateral from the liens securing the Notes will be permitted under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes.” The security interest of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Collateral Trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party or make filings. The Collateral Trustee may not be able to obtain any such consent or make such filing. Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on the Collateral. Accordingly, the Collateral Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral.

As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid. Further, certain assets that are excluded from the collateral that will secure the Notes and the guarantees may be pledged to secure other indebtedness. Consequently, our obligations under the Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to other indebtedness that is secured by assets not constituting collateral that will secure the Notes and the guarantees to the extent of the value of such assets.

For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the Issue Date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection or the issuance of a guarantee (or a year for insiders), a lien given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Issue Date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the Bankruptcy Code with respect to liens). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the Issue Date with respect to the Notes and the liens had been perfected or the guarantees issued less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding (or a year for insiders), such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after the Issue Date. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the guarantee or the security that the guarantee or the Collateral was intended to provide and could be required to return amounts previously paid to them. Equivalent or similar considerations in respect of avoidable or preferential transactions and otherwise may apply in the jurisdictions of incorporation of us or subsidiary guarantors or the locations of our or their assets. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Under the Bankruptcy Code, an automatic stay of actions, including enforcement upon collateral, is imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, and secured creditors, such as the Collateral Trustee, are prohibited from foreclosing upon or otherwise repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be materially delayed). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of such collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Trustee could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case, or whether or to what extent the holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and any additional obligations secured by liens on the Collateral, including interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured” or “deficiency” claims as to the difference. U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees for such undersecured or deficiency claims during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest or other adequate protection had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. Finally, as set forth above, the Collateral Trust Agreement will impose limitations on the ability of the holders of the Notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral and the related liens unless the controlling Collateral Trustee opposes or objects thereto or certain limited specified conditions are not satisfied. In connection with such debtor-in-possession financing, the court may authorize the debtor to grant new liens, including, under certain circumstances, new liens on the Collateral with senior priority to the liens thereon that secure the Notes, and the holders of the Notes would not be permitted to object to such relief. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

However, pursuant to Irish insolvency law, where an Irish company conducts business in another member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the Irish courts may be limited if the company’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is found to be in another Member State. There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the COMI. The COMI should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis, and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which the COMI of a particular company falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by an Irish Company and any security interests granted by an Irish Company. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Irish insolvency laws relating to certain limitations on the guarantee and security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are provided by the Irish Companies. The application of these laws could adversely affect the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the guarantees or security interests in respect of the Notes and limit any amounts that they may receive. The following also contains analysis of the typical forms of security interests in Ireland which are commonly created in Ireland over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges. Under Irish law, for a charge to be characterized as a fixed charge, the charge holder is required to exercise the requisite level of control over the assets purported to be charged and the proceeds of such assets, including any bank account into which such proceeds are paid. There is a risk, therefore, that even a charge which purports to be taken as a fixed charge may take effect as a floating charge if a court deems that the requisite level of control was not exercised. _Preferred creditors under Irish law._ Under Section 621 of the Irish Companies Act 2014 (as amended) (the “Companies Act”), in a winding-up of an Irish company, certain preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Under Section 440 of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), employee-related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation. In addition, there is a further limited category of super-preferential creditors which take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These super-preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the Irish courts (see “—Examinership” below), and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a liquidator, receiver or ----- mortgagee-in-possession, as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) and VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created. If an Irish Company becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and if that entity has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as creditors that are senior relative to the holders of the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceedings. _Limitation on enforcement._ A guarantee by an Irish Company for the obligations of another group company and any security interests granted by an Irish Company must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish Company. If the giving of a guarantee or granting of security is not for the Irish Company’s corporate benefit, the guarantee or security could be held null and void. The giving of a guarantee or security must comply with any applicable financial assistance rules, and, in particular, will not be given to the extent that it would result in such guarantees or security constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Section 82 of the Companies Act. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees. The question whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantee or security could be declared null and void. It is open to a court to find that assignments and charges described as fixed charges constitute floating charges rather than fixed charges, the description given to them as fixed charges not being determinative and no opinion is expressed on whether the security interests created by the relevant security documents are fixed charges or floating charges. One of the three characteristics of a floating charge is the ability of the chargor to carry on business in the ordinary way so far as it concerns the particular class of assets in question until some further step is taken by or on behalf of the chargee. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets, which form the subject matter of the charge, without the consent of the chargee, or the chargee does not exercise the requisite degree of control over the assets, or the proceeds of such assets, the court would be likely to hold that the charge in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. Irish case law has interpreted the requisite level of control to a high standard. To the extent that any of the secured assets are not specifically identified a court may hold that such assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge may in fact be subject to a floating charge. It should be noted that insofar as the relevant security documents purport to create fixed security over future assets the asset must either be identified as at the date of execution of the relevant security documents or identifiable as falling within the security purported to be created thereby. A floating charge is more vulnerable than a fixed charge both to being set aside in a winding-up and to losing its priority to other rights and interests. A fixed charge on book debts is subject to the provisions of Section 1001 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended) which provides inter alia that on receipt of a notice from the Revenue Commissioners that the chargor is in arrears on its PAYE, VAT, PRSI (pay-related social insurance) or LPT (local property tax) payments the holder of the fixed charge must thereafter pay all sums it receives from the chargor to the Revenue Commissioners until the arrears (and any further arrears which accrue) of PAYE, VAT, PRSI or LPT payments (as the case may be) have been discharged in full. Where the holder of the security has informed the Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the ----- security within 21 days of its creation, liability of the holder is limited to the amount of certain tax liabilities of the charger arising after the issue of such notice. Monies held in a bank account of an Irish Company could, notwithstanding any charge or right of set-off over such account being held by the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the notes, be subject to Section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended) which provides inter alia that on receipt of a notice from the Revenue Commissioners that a taxpayer is in arrears in the discharge of any tax, interest or penalty, a person owing money to the taxpayer (including, without limitation, a bank holding monies of the taxpayer) must pay such monies to the Revenue Commissioners. The effectiveness of a charge on a security account held with the chargee is not free from doubt. The exercise of enforcement powers by secured creditors is controlled by law; for example, a mortgagee owes certain duties to the debtor in relation to realizations. These laws may override provisions in the relevant security document to the contrary. On a disposal of the Collateral on an enforcement of the security created pursuant to the relevant security document, the Parent or Issuer, on behalf of the holders of the notes, may be required to pay any capital gains tax owed in respect of those assets in priority to the debts secured by such assets. A notification under the Competition Acts 2002 to 2017 (the “Competition Acts”) may need to be made when enforcing a share charge. Under the Competition Acts, the acquisition, whether directly or indirectly, of control of an undertaking must be notified to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (the “CCPC”) where in the most recent financial year: (a) the aggregate turnover in Ireland of the undertakings involved in the transaction is not less than €60 million; and (b) the turnover in Ireland of each of two or more of the undertakings involved is not less than €10 million. Where the person acquiring control of an undertaking is a receiver or liquidator acting as such, or is an underwriter or jobber acting as such, a notification to the CCPC is not required under the Competition Acts. Where the Competition Acts apply, a transfer that is put into effect without prior notification to and clearance from the CCPC shall be void. In addition, where the person(s) in control of an undertaking involved knowingly and willfully authorize(s) or permit(s) the undertaking involved to fail to notify the transaction within the period specified under the Competition Acts, such person(s) may be found guilty of an offense under the Competition Acts and subject to fines of up to €250,000. Particular provisions apply in relation to media mergers, which, inter alia, disapply the financial thresholds referred to above. Failure to register the particulars of registrable security with the Companies Registration Office within 21 days of the creation of the registrable security constituted by the relevant security document(s), in accordance with Section 409 of the Companies Act, will render the relevant charge void as against any liquidator or creditor of an Irish Company. To the extent that the legal title (as distinct from the beneficial title) to any of the Collateral is not held by an Irish Company, then the legal title will not be subject to the security created by the Irish Company under the relevant security documents. _Unfair preference._ Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish Company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to have certain transactions set aside if they are deemed to be an unfair preference. Section 604 of the Companies Act provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against an Irish company, which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of any creditor or ----- any person on trust for any creditor, with a view of giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor for the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the other creditors within six months (or in the case of a connected person, two years) of the commencement of a winding-up of the Irish company, shall be invalid. The company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due at the date of commencement of the winding-up. Case law relevant to Section 286 of the Irish Companies Act 1963 (as amended) (the substantially similar predecessor to Section 604 of the Companies Act) indicated that a dominant intent on the part of the entity concerned to prefer a creditor over its other creditors was necessary in order for Section 286 to apply. Section 604 is only applicable if, at the time of the conveyance, mortgage or other relevant act, the Irish company was unable to pay its debts as they became due. _Improperly transferred assets._ Under Section 608 of the Companies Act, if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the relevant Irish court that any property of such company was disposed of (which would include by way of transfer, mortgage or security) and the effect of such a disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the company, its creditors or members, the relevant Irish court may, if it deems it just and equitable, order any person who appears to have use, control or possession of such property or the proceeds of the sale or development thereof to deliver it or pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the relevant Irish court sees fit. Receivers and examiners may similarly challenge the transfer of assets pursuant to Sections 443 and 557, respectively, of the Companies Act. Sections 443, 557 and 608 do not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purpose of Section 604 of the Companies Act. _Disclaimer of onerous property._ Sections 615 and 616 of the Companies Act confer power on a liquidator, with leave of the court, at any time within 12 months after the commencement of the winding-up or such extended period as may be allowed by the court, to disclaim any property of the Irish company being wound up which consists of, among other things, (i) unprofitable contracts or (ii) any property which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of money. The liquidator’s hand may be forced, in that any person interested in the property may require him to decide whether or not he will disclaim and if the liquidator wishes to disclaim in such circumstances, he must give notice within 28 days or such further period as may be allowed by the courts that he intends to apply to court to disclaim. A liquidator must disclaim the whole of the property; he may not keep part and disclaim part. A disclaimer terminates as and from the date of the disclaimer the rights, interest and liabilities of the company in the contract or the property, but, the disclaimer does not affect the rights or liabilities of any other person, except so far as necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability. Any person damaged by the operation of a disclaimer shall be deemed a creditor of the company to the amount of the damages, and may prove that amount as a debt in the winding-up. The meaning given to an unprofitable contract is one that would involve the liquidator in some liability. There must be some “burden” associated with the contract; the mere fact that the insolvent company’s estate would be better off by disclaimer is not enough. _Floating charges._ Under Section 597 of the Companies Act, a floating charge is invalid if created in the period of 12 months (or two years if created in favor of a connected person) ending with the date of commencement of the winding-up of the company, and unless it can be proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate. ----- _Examinership._ Examinership is a court moratorium / protection procedure which is available under Irish company law to facilitate the survival of Irish companies in financial difficulties. Where a company which has its COMI in Ireland is, or is likely to be, unable to pay its debts, an examiner may be appointed on petition to the relevant Irish court under Section 509 of the Companies Act. For each Irish Company, their relevant directors, its shareholders holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of its voting share capital, or a contingent, prospective or actual creditor, is entitled to petition the relevant Irish court for the appointment of an examiner. While a company is in examinership, it may not be wound up, creditors may not enforce their claims or their security in respect of the company or its assets, and proceedings cannot be issued or potentially continued against it without the leave of the relevant Irish court. Further, a company in examinership cannot discharge any liability incurred by it before the presentation to the relevant Irish court of the petition for examinership except in strictly defined circumstances. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to halt, prevent or rectify acts or omissions, by or on behalf of the company after his or her appointment and, in certain circumstances, negative pledges given by the company prior to his or her appointment will not be binding on the company. Furthermore, where proposals for a scheme of arrangement are to be formulated, the company may, subject to the approval of the court, affirm or repudiate any contract under which some element of performance other than the payment remains to be rendered by the company and the other contracting party or parties. During the period of protection (normally up to a maximum of 100 days but temporarily extended to 150 days under the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020), where possible, an examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in respect of a company in examinership (the “Proposals”) which he/she believes will ensure the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. The Proposals will detail, among other things, how each class of creditor is to be treated in the context of the examinership and in particular the dividend, if any, they are to receive. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the relevant Irish court when at least one class of creditors, whose interests are impaired under the Proposals, has voted in favor of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such Proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the Proposals and whose interests would be impaired by the implementation of the scheme of arrangement and the Proposals are not unfairly prejudicial to any interested party. Once confirmed by the court, the Proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may be, affected by the Proposals and their rights are accordingly modified. If, for any reason, an examiner was appointed to an Irish Company while any amounts due under the Notes were unpaid, the primary risks to the holders of the notes are as follows: (i) the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the notes, would not be able to take proceedings to enforce rights (including under the guarantees or the security documents) against such entity during the period of examinership; (ii) a scheme of arrangement may be approved involving the writing down of the debt due by such entity to the holders of the notes, irrespective of their views; (iii) an examiner may seek to set aside any negative pledge given by such entity prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by such entity to enable the examiner to borrow to fund such entity during the protection period; and (iv) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and such entity subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of such entity and approved by the relevant Irish court) and the claims of certain other creditors referred to above (including the Irish Revenue Commissioners for certain unpaid taxes) will take priority over the amounts due by such entity to the holders of the notes. ----- Furthermore, the court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers that a liquidator appointed by the court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions set aside under Section 604 of the Companies Act or Section 608 of the Companies Act. _Schemes of arrangement._ A scheme of arrangement is a formal procedure under Part 9 of the Companies Act proposed by a company which enables the company to agree with its creditors or a class of its creditors a composition or arrangement in respect to its debts or obligations owed to those creditors. A scheme of arrangement requires the following to occur in order to become legally binding: (i) the approval of a majority in number representing at least 75% in value of the relevant class of creditors of the company present in person or by proxy and voting at the meeting convened by the permission of the court; (ii) the approval of the court by the making of an order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement; and (iii) the delivery of the order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies. If the scheme of arrangement is approved by the relevant creditors and sanctioned by the court and the order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement is delivered as above, the scheme will bind all the creditors subject to it, both those creditors who voted in favor of it and those creditors who voted against it or did not vote at all and their successors and assigns. A scheme of arrangement cannot be sanctioned by the court unless the court is satisfied, among other things, that the relevant provisions of Part 9 of the Companies Act have been complied with and an intelligent and honest person, a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his own interest, might reasonably approve the scheme of arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Under the Transaction Agreement, at the effective time of the Scheme of Arrangement (the “Effective Time”), all Scheme Shares (as defined in the Scheme of Arrangement) will be transferred to Bidco (and/or, at Bidco’s election, Jazz and/or the DR Nominee), and the Scheme Shareholders (as defined in the Scheme of Arrangement) will have the right to receive, for each such share, (a) $16.662⁄3 in cash and (b) an amount of Jazz ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (“Jazz Ordinary Shares”) equal to the “Exchange Ratio” (defined below).

The actual fair values will be determined following the closing of the Acquisition and will vary from these preliminary estimates.

Each Share Option granted to GW’s employees following the date of the Transaction Agreement (each, a “2021 Share Option”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will become vested as to one-third of the 2021 Share Option at the Effective Time and will be treated in accordance with the previous paragraph. The remaining two-thirds of such 2021 Share Option will cease to represent a right to acquire the GW ADSs and will be converted automatically into an option to acquire Jazz ordinary shares (a “Jazz Option”), half of which will vest on the first anniversary of the original grant date and half of which will vest on the second anniversary of the original grant date, subject to accelerated vesting in connection with qualifying terminations of employment. The number of Jazz ordinary shares subject to each such Jazz Option will be equal to the product of (x) the number of GW ADSs underlying such two-thirds of 2021 Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the GW option exchange ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price for each such Jazz Option will be determined by dividing: (A) the per share exercise price for the GW ADSs underlying such 2021 Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; by (B) the GW option exchange ratio (and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent). Any outstanding 2021 Share Option that is, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to performance-based vesting, will be deemed to have fully satisfied all applicable performance goals such that the corresponding Jazz Option will only continue to vest over the remaining service-vesting schedule. For the purposes of the foregoing, the “GW option exchange ratio” is equal to the sum of (A) the per ADS Share Deliverable plus (B) the per ADS cash consideration divided by the Jazz average share price. Together with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby, concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, it is expected that the Issuer, Jazz and certain other subsidiaries of Jazz will enter into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, consisting of the $500 million New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan Facility.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Jazz will be treated as the accounting acquirer, and accordingly, the GW assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based on preliminary estimates of fair value. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill. The detailed valuation analyses necessary to arrive at required estimates of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from GW in the transaction have not been completed. The actual fair values will be determined upon the completion of the Acquisition and may vary materially from these preliminary estimates. Jazz’s and GW’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The estimated income tax impacts of the pre-tax adjustments that are reflected in the Pro Forma Financial Information are calculated using an estimated blended statutory rate, which is based on preliminary assumptions related to the jurisdictions in which the income (expense) adjustments will be recorded.

Preliminary purchase deliverables and allocation,2941.6.1,,"The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, the GW assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on preliminary estimates of fair value. In accordance with GAAP, Jazz measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Since this unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared based on preliminary estimates of deliverables and fair values attributable to the Acquisition, the actual amounts eventually recorded for the purchase accounting, including the identifiable intangibles and goodwill, may differ materially from the information presented. The initial allocation of the preliminary estimated deliverables in this unaudited pro forma financial information is based upon the estimated value of the deliverables as of March 31, 2021. The estimated purchase deliverables is calculated as follows (all amounts in $ millions except ADS amounts)*: ----- GW ADSs outstanding as of March 31, 2021 (ADSs in millions) ....................................... 32 Cash consideration per GW ADS ......................................................................................... 200 Equity deliverables per GW ADS ........................................................................................ 20 Total cash consideration to GW ADS holders..................................................................... 6,308 (i) Cash consideration to GW share option holders .................................................................. 271 (i) Total cash consideration ....................................................................................................... 6,579 Equity deliverables 631 (ii) Consideration related to share options vesting before December 31, 2020 ......................... 3 (iii) Total equity deliverables ..................................................................................................... 634 Total purchase deliverables ................................................................................................. 7,214 - Totals do not foot due to rounding (i) The total cash consideration was estimated using the GW ADSs outstanding as of March 31, 2021, and the cash consideration due to holders of $200 per GW ADS plus the cash outflow to GW share option holders that will be paid via payroll. The actual cash consideration will be determined upon the completion of the Acquisition. Jazz intends to utilize proceeds from the maturity of short-term deposits, classified as investments on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, to partially fund the total cash consideration. (ii) The equity deliverables for each GW ADS was estimated using the GW ADSs outstanding as of March 31, 2021, and the estimated equity deliverables due to holders of $20 per GW ADS. Based on the 15 day volume-weighted average sales price of a Jazz Ordinary Share on The Nasdaq Global Select Market beginning on the 18[th] trading day prior to April 1, 2021 and the Exchange Ratio, 3.8 million Jazz Ordinary Shares would be issued to satisfy the ADS Share Deliverable. The actual equity deliverables will be determined upon the completion of the Acquisition. (iii) A portion of the fair value of the GW share options that will be converted to Jazz share options and vest over a period equal to two years from the original grant date was also included within the total equity deliverables. The portion of the fair value of GW’s equity awards attributable to pre-combination service that will be assumed by Jazz upon completion of the Acquisition amounts to $3.3 million (see note 6(iv)). The preliminary allocation of purchase deliverables to estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is as follows (all amounts in $ millions): Estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and cash equivalents ............................................................................................................ 487 Accounts receivable ...................................................................................................................... 71 Inventory ....................................................................................................................................... 1,005 (vi) Prepaid expenses ........................................................................................................................... 42 Property, plant and equipment ...................................................................................................... 144 Intangible assets ............................................................................................................................ 5,790 (v) Goodwill ....................................................................................................................................... 922 (iv) Deferred tax assets/liabilities ........................................................................................................

(165) Total allocation ............................................................................................................................. 7,214 Upon completion of the fair value assessment following the Acquisition, Jazz anticipates the finalized fair values of the net assets acquired will differ from the preliminary assessment outlined above. Generally, changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed within a one-year measurement period from the Acquisition Date will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill, which could be material. Except as discussed below, the carrying value of GW’s assets and liabilities are considered to approximate their fair values. (iv) The goodwill balance arising from the Acquisition is estimated to be $922.3 million, which represents a net adjustment of $915.3 million. The goodwill has been calculated as the excess of the purchase deliverable of $7.2 billion over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $6.3 billion. ----- (v) The fair value of GW’s intangible assets is estimated to be $5,790.0 million, or a net increase of $5,784.4 million compared to a carrying value of $5.6 million. The primary intangible assets include acquired developed technologies and IPR&D, for which the fair value estimates of identifiable intangible assets have been determined using the income approach. The assumptions used by Jazz to arrive at the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets have been derived primarily from public information and information provided by Jazz and GW. However, a detailed analysis has not been completed and actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The fair value and weighted average estimated useful life of identifiable intangible assets are estimated as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

(6) Adjustment to intangible assets, net ........................................ 5,784 Based on the estimated respective fair values of identified intangible assets and the weighted average estimated useful lives, an adjustment to amortization expense of $472.4 million has been included in the Pro Forma Statement of Operations, being the annual amortization charge above less $1.2 million amortization of intangible assets purchased by GW expensed in the year ended December 31, 2020. The related estimated net decrease to income tax expense for the Pro Forma Statement of Operations is $89.8 million. This adjustment will recur for the life of the underlying assets. (vi) The fair value of GW’s inventory, which includes raw materials, work in progress and finished goods, is estimated to be $1,004.5 million, which represents an uplift of $875.4 million on the book value of $129.1 million. The fair value adjustment relates only to work in progress and finished goods. The inventory was valued at estimated selling price less the estimated costs to be incurred to complete (in the case of work in progress) and sell the inventory, the associated margins on these activities and holding costs. However, the fair valuation was based on certain assumptions and limited information and therefore the final amounts may differ materially from these estimates. The step up in the fair value of inventory is expected to increase cost of goods sold in the twelve-month period post-close by $304.9 million as the inventory is sold. The related estimated net decrease to income tax expense for the Pro Forma Statement of Operations is $57.9 million. The remaining step up in the fair value of inventory is expected to increase cost of goods sold after the first twelve-month period post-close as the inventory is sold. (vii) The deferred and current income tax impact of acquisition accounting adjustments primarily relates to the estimated fair value of the net deferred tax liability of $1,081.8 million, which represents an adjustment of $1,102.6 million. This adjustment comprises $1,099.0 million in relation to the fair value uplift on intangible assets and $166.3 million in relation to the fair value uplift on inventory, offset by acquired net operating losses and temporary differences.

These costs include advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees, and a six year prepaid “tail policy” for directors’ and officers’ insurance, none of which were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs will not have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. (ii) Total estimated transaction and related costs in conjunction with the transaction of $194.9 million are attributable as follows: Jazz $101.3 million and GW $93.6 million, none of which were incurred as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, an adjustment of $97.9 million related to the Jazz costs (net of an estimated tax benefit of $3.4 million) has been presented in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents and income taxes payable with a corresponding reduction to retained earnings to represent the estimated future charge. An adjustment of $93.0 million related to the GW costs (net of an estimated tax benefit of $0.6 million) has been presented in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet as a reduction to cash and cash equivalents and income taxes payable with a corresponding increase to goodwill as these transaction costs will reduce GW’s retained earnings prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. (iii) In order to retain and incentivize certain of GW’s executives through the closing of the transaction and during an important integration period thereafter, GW agreed that the executive officers would be eligible to receive incentive bonuses totaling $17.9 million, inclusive of employer payroll taxes. The transition incentive bonuses will be payable in a lump sum within 30 days following the later of December 31, 2021 or six months following the effective time (in each case, subject to the executive’s continued employment with Jazz, GW or their respective subsidiaries as of such time) or, if earlier, within 30 days following the executive’s death, permanent disability or a qualifying termination under the applicable GW severance plan and the executive’s applicable participation agreement, subject to the execution of a release of claims against GW. The Acquisition will constitute a change of control of GW for purposes of the GW severance plans. The estimated aggregate value of the cash severance payments GW’s executive officers would receive in the event of a qualifying termination upon the completion of the Acquisition is $9.7 million, based on compensation and benefit levels in effect as of March 11, 2021. An adjustment of $23.8 million and $3.8 million is reflected in selling, general and administrative and research and development costs, respectively, in the Pro Forma Statement of Operations with a corresponding income tax impact of $0.3 million. These costs will not have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. (iv) Upon closing of the Acquisition, each outstanding Pre-2021 Share Option and each Share Option granted following the date of the Transaction Agreement to GW’s non-employee directors that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, to the extent unvested, will be deemed to be fully vested and each such Share Option will be exercised automatically at the effective time and the holder will be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of their rights in respect of such Share Option, an amount in cash, without interest, ----- equal to the product of (x) the number of GW ADSs underlying such Share Option (or if such Share Option is in respect of GW ordinary shares, the number of GW ordinary shares divided by 12 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)) and (y) the excess (if any) of the Value of the scheme deliverables over the per share exercise price of each Share Option (or, if the share exercise price is in respect of GW ordinary shares, the share exercise price multiplied by 12). Each 2021 Share Option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will become vested as to one-third of the 2021 Share Option at the effective time and will be treated in accordance with the previous paragraph. The remaining two-thirds of such 2021 Share Option will cease to represent a right to acquire the GW ADSs and will be converted automatically into an option to acquire Jazz ordinary shares (a “Jazz Option”), half of which will vest on the first anniversary of the original grant date and half of which will vest on the second anniversary of the original grant date, subject to accelerated vesting in connection with qualifying terminations of employment. The number of Jazz ordinary shares subject to each such Jazz Option will be equal to the product of (x) the number of GW ADSs underlying such two-thirds of 2021 Share Option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (y) the GW option exchange ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price for each such Jazz Option will be determined by dividing: (A) the per share exercise price for the GW ADSs underlying such 2021 Share Option immediately prior to the effective time; by (B) the GW option exchange ratio (and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent). Any outstanding 2021 Share Option that is, as of immediately prior to the effective time, subject to performance-based vesting, will be deemed to have fully satisfied all applicable performance goals such that the corresponding Jazz Option will only continue to vest over the remaining service-vesting schedule. As the share options that will be exercised automatically on close were subject to a preexisting change in control provision, the amount of the cash settlement totaling $254.6 million, which equals the fair value of the option, has been included as part of the deliverables transferred to GW. The deliverables transferred also includes the related payroll tax liability totaling $16.5 million that will become due and payable upon consummation of the Acquisition as a result of the preexisting change in control provision. The adjustment is reflected as a decrease to cash and cash equivalents and a corresponding increase to goodwill. For the GW share options converted to Jazz Options, which are equal in fair value to the original GW award as of the Acquisition Date, the portion of the awards that has been included as part of the deliverables transferred totaling $3.3 million has been determined by multiplying the fair value of the award by the requisite service period that elapsed prior to the Acquisition divided by the total service period. The adjustment is reflected as an increase in goodwill and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in-capital. The estimated portion of the Jazz Options attributable to post-combination services will result in additional compensation expense of $35.3 million. An adjustment of $1.5 million, $25.9 million and $7.9 million is reflected in cost of product sales, selling, general and administrative and research and development costs, respectively, for the portion of this additional compensation expense that will be recorded over the first 12 months subsequent to the Acquisition. The related estimated net decrease to income tax expense for the Pro Forma Statement of Operations is $5.8 million. This adjustment will not have a continuing impact on the combined company once the post-combination service period has elapsed. Additionally, due to the preexisting change in control provision discussed above, GW will record an additional $97.7 million of previously unrecognized compensation cost related to original awards outstanding prior to the consummation of the Acquisition due to the reduction in the requisite service period upon the change in control. An adjustment of $4.0 million, $71.6 million and $22.0 million is reflected in cost of product sales, selling, general and administrative and research and development, respectively, in the Pro Forma Statement of Operations with a corresponding income tax impact of $28.3 million. These costs will not have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The net cost has been shown as an increase to additional paid-in-capital and a corresponding decrease to retained earnings in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

As the final terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have not yet been agreed upon, the final terms may differ from those set forth herein and any such differences may be significant. This summary is not a complete description of all of the terms of the credit agreement governing the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities._ Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we expect that the Issuer, Jazz and certain other subsidiaries of Jazz will enter into New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, with Bank of America, N.A., as New Senior Secured Credit Facilities Administrative Agent, expected to consist of the $500 million New Revolving Credit Facility, and the New Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount that, when added to the principal amount of the Notes as of the Acquisition Date, equals approximately $5,350,000,000, and which may include the U.S. dollar-denominated New USD Term Loan Facility and the Euro-denominated New Euro Term Loan Facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to mature five years after it is entered into and the New Term Loan Facility is expected to mature seven years after it is entered into. We expect that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, including after the consummation of the Acquisition (and following re-registration of GW as a private limited company), GW and certain of its subsidiaries. We expect the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by a first-priority lien (subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions), equally and ratably with all existing and future first lien obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors, including the Notes and the related guarantees, on the collateral, as described under “Description of the Notes—Collateral and Security.” We expect that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate (in the case of the New USD Term Loan Facility) or EURIBOR (in the case of the New Euro Term Loan Facility), in each case plus a margin, and each such rate will be subject to a customary floor. We expect that the New USD Term Loan Facility will require quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof. The New Term Loan Facility will also require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. We expect to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the New Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for similar financings and which are expected to include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, under certain circumstances, we expect that financial covenants based on Jazz’s consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio will apply to the New Revolving Credit Facility. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, and conditioned upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 15 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, but not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraphs will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit rating. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default under the Credit Agreement. Future Bank Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Bank Indebtedness to be repaid upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event could cause a default under such Bank Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes and other indebtedness—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.” The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Approximately 97% of the Equity Interests of GW Pharmaceuticals are deposited with a Citibank custodian and represented by American Depositary Shares (the “ADSs”) issued by a Citibank depositary nominee and listed on NASDAQ. On or promptly following the Acquisition Date, the existing Citi arrangement will be replaced with an arrangement whereby such Equity Interests will be owned by GTU Ops Inc., a nominee of Computershare Trust Company NA. and represented by one or more new depositary receipts issued by Computershare Trust Company NA., as a depositary, to, and owned, by Bidco. On or promptly following the Acquisition Date, Bidco will pledge the depositary receipts, but not the underlying Equity Interests, to the Collateral Trustee. The Indenture and the Collateral Documents will exclude certain property from the Collateral (collectively, the “Excluded Property”): (1) (x) any leasehold interest in real property, (y) any interest in fee-owned real property owned by any U.S. Grantor and (z) any interest in fee-owned real property owned by any Foreign Grantor with a Fair Market Value less than $25.0 million (unless a security interest in such real property can be perfected without additional perfection steps); (2) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title (except to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing of financing statements or similar filing under applicable law, or automatically without any additional perfection steps); (3) letter of credit rights (except to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing of financing statements or similar filing under applicable law, or automatically without any additional perfection steps); (4) Commercial Tort Claims (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) with a value of less than $10 million (except to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing of financing statements or similar filing under applicable law, or automatically without any additional perfection steps); (5) any lease, license or other similar agreement or any property subject to a purchase money security interest, capital lease or similar arrangement, in each case, not prohibited by the Indenture, to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or other agreement or purchase money arrangement, capital lease, or similar arrangement or create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than a Grantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law and other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition; (6) any U.S. intent-to-use trademark application prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto; (7) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, licenses, permits, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests therein are prohibited or restricted thereby after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law; (8) any Equity Interests of (a) Unrestricted Subsidiaries, (b) any Immaterial Subsidiary, (c) any Insurance Subsidiary, (d) any not-for-profit subsidiaries, (e) any employee benefit trust company and (f) any person that is not a borrower under the Initial Credit Agreement or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary to the extent the granting of a security interest therein would violate the terms of such person’s organizational ----- documents or any shareholders’ agreement or joint venture agreement relating to such person (after giving effect to applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law); (9) receivables and related assets securing any Qualified Receivables Facility in compliance with clause (16) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”; (10) any assets to the extent a pledge thereof would be prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law, or by any applicable contractual requirement in existence on the Acquisition Date or otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture, that is binding on and related to such asset on the date of the acquisition of such subsidiary that owns such assets (not created in contemplation of the acquisition by Parent of such subsidiary) (and only for so long as such restriction or any replacement or renewal thereof is in effect) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law; (11) margin stock; and (12) any assets as to which the Administrative Representative reasonably determines in consultation with Parent that the costs or other consequences (including, without limitations, tax consequences) of obtaining a security interest are excessive in relation to the value of the security afforded thereby; provided that Excluded Property shall not include any proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any Excluded Property referred to in clause (1) through (12) (unless such proceeds, substitutions or replacements would constitute Excluded Property referred to in clauses (1) through (12). In addition, the Indenture will provide that in no event shall (1) deposit or securities account control agreements or control, lockbox or similar arrangements be required with respect to deposit accounts, securities accounts or commodities accounts, (2) landlord, mortgagee and bailee waivers or subordination agreements be required or (3) notices be required to be sent to account debtors or other contractual third parties unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (and, in connection with Collateral of a Grantor incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, unless instruction from the Trustee is received following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing) (other than, in each case, customary notices or acknowledgments to create or perfect security solely to the extent necessary under any relevant non-U.S. law in order to grant a security interest in the applicable Collateral and subject in each case to the Agreed Guarantee and Security Principles). In addition, the Indenture will contain “Agreed Guarantee and Security Principles” identical to those that are included in the Initial Credit Agreement that will impose limitations on the obligations of the Grantors to guarantee the Notes Obligations and take actions to create or perfect liens on assets that would otherwise constitute Collateral. Such limitations could significantly impact the amounts recoverable upon exercise of remedies with respect to the Collateral. _Perfection and non-perfection of security interests in the Collateral_ The security to be provided on or after the Acquisition Date will, subject to certain exceptions described in the Collateral Documents, consist of first priority liens granted by the Grantors on (i) substantially all of the assets of the Grantors organized or incorporated under the laws of Ireland, England and Wales and the United States or any state thereof, other than Excluded Property, (ii) the Equity Interests of Parent, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors that are acting as borrowers under the Initial Credit Agreement and (iii) certain other assets of various of the Grantors. The security that is not provided on the Acquisition Date will be required to be provided within 90 days of the Acquisition Date (as such date may be extended in accordance with the terms of the Initial Credit Agreement and the Collateral Documents), but only to the extent that such security is required by the Initial Credit Agreement. In addition, GW Pharmaceuticals and its Subsidiaries will not become Guarantors or Grantors until after the Acquisition Date (and following the re-registration of GW Pharmaceuticals as a private limited company), and none of their assets will be Collateral until such time as they become Guarantors. No assurances can be given that such security interests will be granted or perfected on a timely basis. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Indebtedness, the Notes and this Offering—Security interests in certain collateral will not be in place on the Acquisition Date or will not be perfected by the Acquisition Date. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the Acquisition Date increases the risk that such security interests could be avoided.” ----- _Corresponding Action_ The Indenture will provide that each Grantor agrees that if it shall be required to take any action following the Acquisition Date to grant, perfect or otherwise establish a Lien on and/or security interest in any of its assets or properties to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations, then, subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, such Grantor shall be required to take the corresponding actions in favor of the Collateral Trustee in order to provide a corresponding benefit to the Collateral Trustee for its benefit and the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties. _After Acquired Property_ From and after the Acquisition Date, if any asset (other than real property) is acquired by any Grantor or owned by an entity at the time it becomes a Guarantor (in each case other than (x) assets constituting Collateral under a Collateral Document that automatically become subject to the Lien of such Collateral Document upon acquisition thereof and (y) assets constituting Excluded Property), such Grantor, will, (i) notify the Trustee and the Collateral Trustee of such acquisition or ownership and (ii) cause such asset to be subjected to a Lien (subject to any Permitted Liens) securing the Notes Obligations, and take, and cause the Grantors to take, such actions as may be required to perfect such Liens subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Indenture and the Collateral Documents. _Information Regarding Collateral_ The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee and the Collateral Trustee prompt written notice of any change (A) in any Grantor’s corporate or organization name, (B) in any Grantor’s identity or organizational structure, (C) in any Grantor’s organizational identification number (to the extent relevant in the applicable jurisdiction of organization) and (D) in any Grantor’s jurisdiction of organization; provided, that within thirty (30) days following such change (as such date may be extended pursuant to the Initial Credit Agreement or any other Credit Agreement), Parent shall make all filings under the Uniform Commercial Code (or its equivalent in any applicable jurisdiction) that are required in order for the Collateral Trustee to continue to have a valid, legal and perfected security interest in all the Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by such filing, for the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties. It is understood that the Grantors and not the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee shall be obligated to make such filings or otherwise maintain perfection. _Further Assurances_ The Indenture will require the Grantors to execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements and other documents), that are required or that the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee may reasonably request (including, without limitation, those required by applicable law), as may be necessary or proper to evidence, create, perfect, maintain and enforce the security interests and the priority thereof in the Collateral in favor of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties, and to otherwise effectuate the provisions or purposes of the Indenture and the Collateral Documents.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202
1546_1,Offerings 2021.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.18,Collateral and Security,238.18.2,Certain Bankruptcy Limitations,"The right and ability of the Collateral Trustee to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired, or at a minimum delayed, by applicable Bankruptcy Law in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against a Grantor prior to the Collateral Trustee having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral and sometimes even after. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Collateral Trustee is prohibited from repossessing Collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of Collateral previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which potentially may not be given or could be materially delayed under the facts and circumstances of any particular case). In addition, because a portion of the Collateral may from time to time consist of pledges of the Capital Stock of certain foreign entities, the validity of those pledges under applicable foreign law, and the ability of the Collateral Trustee to realize upon such pledges under applicable foreign law, may be limited by such foreign laws, which limitations may or may not adversely affect such Liens. ----- Under the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor in certain circumstances may continue to retain and to use collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such Collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection,” the meaning of which could vary according to circumstances. In view of the broad equitable powers of a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of adequate protection, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes and the Guarantees could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Collateral Trustee could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or thereafter during a bankruptcy case, or whether or to what extent holders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral or would be entitled to and may receive adequate protection. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent (i) provided for in the operative agreement between the secured creditor and the debtor and (ii) the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Guarantees of the Guarantors and their guarantees of any other Obligations under First Lien Indebtedness, holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of their pro rata share of the value of the Collateral, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to any shortfall. Applicable Bankruptcy Laws permit the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the claims are oversecured or the debtor is solvent at the time of reorganization, and would not provide for adequate protection with respect to any undersecured portion of these claims. Any future guarantee or pledge of Collateral in favor of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Collateral Trustee, the Trustee and the holders of Notes, including pursuant to Collateral Documents delivered after the Issue Date, might be avoidable by the guarantor or pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by our other creditors) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the guarantor or pledgor is insolvent at the time of the guarantee or pledge, the guarantee or pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the guarantee or pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the guarantor or pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the guarantee or pledge, or, up to a year for recipients that are statutory “insiders”. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to the Notes —Any future pledge or perfection of collateral might be avoidable in bankruptcy.” _Release of Liens_ The Liens on the Collateral will be released: (1) in whole, upon satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture; (2) in whole, upon the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance” (3) in part, as to any property or asset constituting Collateral (A) that is sold or otherwise disposed of (other than to another Grantor) in a transaction not prohibited under “——Asset Sales,” or (B) that is owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent such Subsidiary Guarantor has been released from its guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; (4) as described below under the caption “—Amendments and Waivers”, including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes; (5) in part, to the extent constituting Excluded Property as a result of a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture; ----- (6) in the case of Permitted Receivables Facility Assets, upon the disposition thereof not prohibited by the Indenture by any Grantor to a Receivables Entity of such Permitted Receivables Facility Assets pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Facility; (7) to the extent required by the Collateral Trust Agreement; or (8) in part, as to any property or asset constituting Collateral which is released from all liens securing Indebtedness under (i) the Credit Agreement and (ii) all other Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority, in each case, other than a release by or as a result of (x) refinancing such Indebtedness to the extent such refinancing Indebtedness is secured by such property or assets or (y) payment of such Indebtedness. The Liens on the Collateral will also be automatically released upon payment in full of the principal of, together with any accrued and unpaid interest on and all other obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral Documents that are payable at or prior to the time such principal together with accrued and unpaid interest are paid. If the Collateral Trustee is requested to authorize or sign a release of Collateral, the Issuer will furnish to the Collateral Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel and such other documentation as is required by the Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the Collateral Trust Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

If any Junior Lien Secured Party receives Post-Petition Interest and/or adequate protection payments in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding (“Junior Lien Adequate Protection Payments”), and the Senior Lien Secured Parties do not receive payment in full in cash of all Senior Lien Obligations upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan for, or conclusion of, that insolvency or liquidation proceeding, then each Junior Lien Secured Party shall pay over to the Senior Lien Secured Party an amount (the “Pay-Over Amount”) equal to the lesser of (i) the Junior Lien Adequate Protection Payments received by such Junior Lien Secured Party and (ii) the amount of the short-fall (the “Shortfall”) in payment in full of the Senior Lien Obligations; provided that to the extent any portion of the Shortfall represents payments received by the Senior Lien Secured Parties in the form of promissory notes, equity or other property, equal in value to the cash paid in respect of the Pay-Over Amount, the Senior Lien Secured Parties shall, upon receipt of the Pay-Over Amount, transfer those promissory notes, equity or other property equal in value to the cash paid in respect of the Pay-Over Amount to the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties in exchange for the Pay-Over Amount. Notwithstanding anything in the Collateral Trust Agreement to the contrary, the Senior Lien Secured Parties shall not be deemed to have consented to, and expressly retain their rights to object to the grant of adequate protection in the form of cash payments to the Junior Lien Secured Parties made pursuant to this paragraph. Nothing contained in the Collateral Trust Agreement shall prohibit or in any way limit any Senior Lien Representative or any Senior Lien Secured Party from objecting in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to any action taken by the Collateral Trustee (on behalf of the Junior Lien Secured Parties), any Junior Lien Representative or any of the other Junior Lien Secured Parties, including the seeking by the Collateral Trustee (on behalf of the Junior Lien Secured Parties), any Junior Lien Representative or any of the other Junior Lien Secured Parties of adequate protection or the assertion by the Collateral Trustee (on behalf of the Junior Lien Secured Parties), any Junior Lien Representative or any of the other Junior Lien Secured Parties of any of its rights and remedies under the Junior Lien Documents or otherwise.

The Collateral Trust Agreement will provide that no Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Secured Party represented by it, shall vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with or that violates the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement. The Collateral Trust Agreement will be a “subordination agreement” under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and any similar Bankruptcy Law, which will be effective before, during and after the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

In the event that Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Issuer will provide the Trustee with written notice of each Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date within five Business Days of the occurrence thereof. Additionally, during a Suspension Period Parent will no longer be permitted to designate any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless Parent would have been permitted to designate such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if a Suspension Period had not been in effect for any period and, following the Reversion ----- Date, such designation shall be deemed to have created an Investment pursuant to the final paragraph of the covenant described under the heading “—Limitation on restricted payments” at the time of such designation.

Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on restricted payments” (except to the extent expressly set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph). As described above, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by Parent or the Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. Within 30 days of such Reversion Date, Parent must comply with the terms of the covenant described under “—Future guarantors.” For purposes of the “—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries” covenant, on the Reversion Date, any consensual encumbrances or consensual restrictions of the type specified in clause (a) or (b) of the first paragraph of that covenant entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect on the Issue Date or Acquisition Date, as applicable, so that they are permitted under clause (1)(i) of the first paragraph under “—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries.” For purposes of the “—Transactions with affiliates” covenant, any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to a contract, agreement, loan, advance or guaranty with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect as of the Issue Date or Acquisition Date, as applicable, for purposes of clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Transactions with affiliates.” For purposes of the “—Asset sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.

Where any Indebtedness of any Person other than Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is guaranteed by one or more of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries deemed to be Incurred or outstanding as a result of all such guarantees shall not exceed the amount of such guaranteed Indebtedness. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount (or, if applicable, the liquidation preference, face amount, or the like) of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of the refinancing, the U.S. dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or, if applicable, the liquidation preference, face amount, or the like) of the refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount (or, if applicable, the liquidation preference, face amount, or the like) of the Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any additional Indebtedness Incurred to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, underwriting discounts, commissions, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith. ----- Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount (or, if applicable, the liquidation preference, face amount, or the like) of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Parent occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged, (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, ----- (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy, (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense, (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity, and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must mail, or deliver electronically if the Notes are held by DTC, to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee.

If since the beginning of such period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro _forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a Eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of the Notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the Notes. ----- Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

Effect of Certain Contingencies",2942.1.1,,"The terms of the Notes provide for payments by us in excess of stated interest or principal, or prior to their scheduled payment dates, under certain circumstances. The possibility of such payments may implicate the provisions of the applicable Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” According to those Treasury regulations, the possibility that certain payments in excess of stated interest or principal, or prior to their scheduled payment dates, will be made will not affect the amount of income a U.S. Holder recognizes in advance of the payment of such excess or accelerated amounts, if there is only a remote chance as of the date the Notes are issued that any such payments will be made. We intend to take the position that the likelihood that any such payments will be made is remote within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations. Our position that these contingencies are remote is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder discloses its contrary position to the IRS in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge our position or that any such challenge would not be sustained by a court. If the IRS were to challenge this position successfully, a U.S. Holder might be required, among other things, to accrue interest income based on a projected payment schedule and comparable yield, which may be in excess of stated interest, and treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note. In the event a contingency described above occurs, it could affect the amount, timing and character of the income or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder. Prospective U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

This discussion applies only to Notes acquired in this offering at their original “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers)) and to U.S. Holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address tax considerations applicable to subsequent purchasers of Notes or Notes subsequently purchased by U.S. Holders. This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations, judicial decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. This discussion is for general information only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, such as Notes held by investors subject to special tax rules (e.g., banks or other financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment with respect to the Notes, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors therein, tax-exempt entities (including private foundations), real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, corporations treated as “personal holding companies,” “controlled foreign corporations,” or “passive foreign investment companies,” individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, persons that will hold the Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated security transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, taxpayers required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to a Note as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement or U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those discussed below. In addition, this discussion does not discuss any U.S. federal tax considerations other than income tax considerations (e.g., estate and gift tax considerations), tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax act or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and any intergovernmental agreements entered in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement), or any state, local, or non-U.S. tax considerations. Further, it does not address the tax consequences to holders who are not U.S. Holders. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source. If the interest on the Notes does have an Irish source then an exemption from withholding tax on interest payments exists under Section 64 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (the “1997 Act”) for certain securities (“quoted Eurobonds”) issued by a company (such as the Issuer), which are interest bearing and are quoted on a recognized stock exchange. Any interest paid on such quoted Eurobonds can be paid free of withholding tax provided: (i) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland; or (ii) the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and either: (a) the quoted Eurobond is held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, or (b) the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as an Irish paying agent) in the prescribed form. So long as, at the time interest is paid on the Notes, the Notes are quoted on a recognized stock exchange, such as the Bermuda Stock Exchange, and are held in a recognized clearing system, such as DTC, interest on the notes can be paid by us and any paying agent acting on our behalf without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax. If, for any reason, the quoted Eurobond exemption referred to above does not or ceases to apply, the issuer can still pay interest on the notes free of withholding tax provided that it is a “qualifying company” (within the meaning of section 110 of the 1997 Act), and provided the interest is paid to a person resident in a “Relevant Territory” (i.e. a member state of the European Union (other than Ireland) or in a country with which Ireland has in force or has signed a double tax agreement). For this purpose, residence is determined by reference to the law of the country in which the recipient claims to be resident. This exemption from withholding tax will not apply, however, if the interest is paid to a company in connection with a trade or business carried on by it through a branch or agency in Ireland. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source and therefore be within the charge to Irish income tax, PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (“USC”). Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of tax on income and any person, including a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, with Irish source income comes within its scope. However, interest on the Notes will be exempt from Irish income tax if the recipient of the interest is resident in a relevant territory provided either (i) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and are exempt from withholding tax as set out above and the recipient is not resident in Ireland; (ii) in the event of the Notes not being or ceasing to be quoted Eurobonds exempt from withholding tax, if the Issuer is a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110 of the 1997 Act, and the interest is paid out of the assets of the Issuer; (iii) if the Issuer has ceased to be a qualifying company, the recipient of the interest is a company resident in a Relevant Territory that generally taxes interest receivable by companies from foreign sources; or (iv) the interest is exempt from income tax under the provisions of a double taxation agreement that was then in force when the interest was paid or would have been exempt had a double taxation agreement that was signed at the date the interest was paid been in force at that date. In addition, provided that the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and are exempt from withholding tax as set out above, the interest on the Notes will be exempt from Irish income tax if the recipient of the interest is (i) a company under the control, directly or indirectly, of persons who by virtue of the law of a relevant territory are resident in that country and that person or persons are not themselves under the control whether directly or indirectly of a person who is not resident in such a country and the interest is paid out of the assets of the Issuer or (ii) a company, the principal class of shares of such company, or a company of which the recipient company is a 75% subsidiary or a company wholly owned by two or more such companies, is substantially or regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange in Ireland or a relevant territory or in a territory or on a stock exchange approved by the Irish Minister for Finance. For the purposes of the exemptions described above, the residence of the recipient in a relevant territory is determined by reference to: (i) the relevant treaty between Ireland and the relevant territory, where such treaty has been entered into and has the force of law; and (ii) under the laws of that territory, where there is no relevant treaty which has the force of law.

These obligations stem from U.S. legislation, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the U.S. Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010 (“FATCA”), which may impose a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain withholdable payments’ made on or after 1 July 2014 for non-compliance and requires Financial Institutions (as defined) to enter into and comply with an agreement with the IRS to collect and provide to the IRS substantial information regarding direct and indirect owners and account holders. On 21 December 2012 Ireland signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the United States to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA. Under this agreement Ireland agreed to implement legislation to collect certain information in connection with FATCA and the Irish and U.S. tax authorities have agreed to automatically exchange this information. The IGA provides for the annual automatic exchange of information in relation to accounts and investments held by certain U.S. persons in a broad category of Irish financial institutions and vice versa. Under the IGA and the Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 as amended by the Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 and the Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (the “Irish Regulations”) implementing the information disclosure obligations, Irish Financial Institutions such as ourselves are required to report certain information with respect to U.S. account holders and non-financial entities controlled by U.S. persons to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The Irish Revenue Commissioners will automatically provide that information annually to the IRS. We must obtain the necessary information from investors required to satisfy the reporting requirements whether under the IGA, the Irish Regulations or any other applicable legislation published in connection ----- with FATCA and such information may be sought from each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes. It should be noted that the Irish Regulations require the collection of information and filing of returns with the Irish Revenue Commissioners regardless as to whether we hold any U.S. assets or have any U.S. investors. However to the extent that the Notes are held in a recognized clearing system, such as DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking SA, we should have no reportable accounts in a tax year. In that event, we are required to make a nil return for that year to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. While the IGA and Irish Regulations should serve to reduce the burden of compliance with FATCA, and accordingly the risk of a FATCA withholding on payments to us in respect of our assets, no assurance can be given in this regard.

The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local Financial Institutions (“FIs”) relating to account holders resident in other participating countries to assist in the efficient collection of tax. The OECD, in developing the Standard, has used FATCA concepts and as such the CRS is broadly similar to the FATCA requirements, albeit with numerous alterations. Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of the CRS while sections 891F and 891G of the 1997 Act and regulations made thereunder contain the measures implementing the CRS in Ireland.

The Mandatory Automatic Exchange of Information in the Field of Taxation Regulations 2015 (and, together with the CRS Regulations, the “Regulations”), gave effect to DAC II from 1 January 2016.

The Irish Revenue Commissioners shall in turn exchange such information with their counterparts in participating jurisdictions. However, to the extent that the Notes are held within a recognized clearing system, we should have no reportable accounts in a tax year. In such event, we are required to make a nil return for that year to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202

This withholding tax also applies on accrued or capitalized interest received upon disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for withholding the 20% WHT will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of the 2005 Law. Further, a Luxembourg resident individual who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who is the beneficial owner of an interest payment or other similar income made by a paying agent established outside Luxembourg in a Member State of the European Union or of the European Economic Area may also, in accordance with the 2005 Law, opt to self declare and pay a final 20% levy (the “20% Levy”). In such case, the 20% Levy is calculated on the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agents. The option for the 20% Levy must cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during the entire civil year. _Non-resident Noteholders_ Under the Luxembourg tax law currently in effect, there is no withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a Luxembourg non-resident Noteholder, repayment of the principal, or redemption or exchange of the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,202
