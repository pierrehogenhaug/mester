As described in Note 2 to the December 31, 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2020 Annual Report, in August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), which requires entities to defer implementation costs incurred that are related to the application development stage in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 requires deferred implementation costs to be amortized over the term of the cloud computing arrangement and presented in the same expense line item as the cloud computing arrangement. All other implementation costs are generally expensed as incurred. We adopted ASU 2018-15 on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-15, (i) certain implementation costs that were previously expensed as incurred are now deferred as prepaid expenses and amortized over the term of the cloud computing arrangement and (ii) certain costs associated with developing interfaces between a cloud computing arrangement and internal use software that were previously capitalized as property and equipment are now deferred as prepaid expenses and amortized over the term of the cloud computing arrangement. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. As described in Note 2 to the December 31, 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2020 Annual Report, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements (“ASU 2016-13”), which changes the recognition model for credit losses related to assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the threshold that a loss must be considered probable to recognize a credit loss and instead requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. We adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis by recording a cumulative effect adjustment of €0.8 million to our owner’s equity related to the net increase to our allowances for certain trade receivables and contract assets. As described in Note 2 to the December 31, 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2020 Annual Report and the September 30, 2021 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2021 Quarterly Report, in December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2019-12, simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is intended to improve consistency and simplify several areas of existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. ASU 2019-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1, 2021 and such adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The historical consolidated results of VodafoneZiggo are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results that may be expected for any future period. VodafoneZiggo’s consolidated financial results are reported in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into euro have been calculated at the September 30, 2021 market rate.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627
519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,309,CURRENCY PRESENTATION AND DEFINITIONS,309.6,Other Financial Measures,309.6.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum and the information incorporated by reference herein, we present Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below, and previously referred to as “operating cash flow”), which is not required by, or presented with, U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is also a key factor that is used by our management and our supervisory board to evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other xvii ----- incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (a) readily view operating trends, (b) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between entities and (c) identify strategies to improve operating performance. We believe our Adjusted EBITDA measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss, cash flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is presented under “Summary Financial and Operating Data” in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

These include the Sustainability Performance Targets and certain sustainability-related metrics set forth in “Sustainability-Linked Finance Framework”. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures by other companies. Any or all of these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute measure of performance under U.S. GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles.,N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Thus, a subscriber who receives digital television, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services from us (regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as three RGUs. Mobile subscribers are counted based on the number of subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in service. The subscriber data included in this Offering Memorandum, including penetration RGU figures, rates and average monthly subscription revenue earned per Fixed-Line Customer or mobile subscriber, as applicable (“ARPU”), are determined by management, are not part of VodafoneZiggo’s financial statements and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by an outside independent auditor, consultant or expert or by any of the Initial Purchasers.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Adjusted EBITDA is also a key factor that is used by our management and our Supervisory Board to evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other 9 ----- incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (a) readily view operating trends, (b) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between entities and (c) identify strategies to improve operating performance. We believe our Adjusted EBITDA measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss, cash flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows.

As of September 30, 2021, the total principal amount of third-party borrowings of VodafoneZiggo was €10.9 billion (equivalent) (which includes finance lease obligations). We also had €800.0 million available to draw under the revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility (which represents the entire amount available thereunder). We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Existing Credit Facility, and the indentures governing the Notes and the Existing Notes will and/or do contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the aforementioned indentures and the Existing Credit Facility will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our indebtedness, as defined in the aforementioned arrangements, is not affected by the adoption of ASU 2016-02), as of January 1, 2019. Since the adoption of this ASU 2016-02, we recognize substantial lease liabilities and substantial right-of-use assets. Further, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the Existing Credit Facility each allows us or will allow us, in certain circumstances, to make dividend payments and to make other distributions under the applicable covenants thereunder limiting restricted payments or to make minority investments or investments in joint ventures. See the discussions under the heading “Description of Other Indebtedness of VodafoneZiggo” for further information about our substantial debt. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, and in turn, the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. In addition, the Existing Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests, including, among other things, borrowing additional funds. These restrictions are subject to significant 39 ----- exceptions. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the Existing Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Notes and/or the Existing Notes, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debts or have a similar material adverse effect on us. We may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection with any future acquisition. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new credit facilities, or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including during the period following the consummation of this Offering. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, or the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt in addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk _Factors”, could intensify._",N/A,as_expected,2022,627
519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.2,Our substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects.,"We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek to maintain our debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that is less than 5.0 times our Covenant EBITDA (as defined herein and Note 11 of the 2020 Annual Report). At September 30, 2021, the principal amount of our total third-party outstanding debt and finance lease obligations was €10.9 billion (equivalent). We believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our debt maturities grow in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities in light of the current market conditions. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with our leverage covenants is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase our Covenant EBITDA and to achieve adequate returns on our capital expenditures and acquisitions. Accordingly, if our Covenant EBITDA declines or we encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional debt financing in order to meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund capital expenditures, working capital needs, acquisitions, or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any additional debt financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Such additional indebtedness may include the incurrence of additional notes issued under the indentures governing the Existing Notes and/or the upsizing of VodafoneZiggo’s existing indebtedness. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets (including through an additional term loan facility or the entry into additional financing arrangements, funded with the proceeds of notes issued by the Issuer or another financing company) or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of this Offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election, and if such debt is in the form of securities (including additional notes under the relevant indentures governing the Notes and/or the Existing Notes ), would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such additional indebtedness will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such indebtedness and, to the extent the interest rate is greater than the interest rate applicable to any indebtedness that is refinanced, or to the extent of any incremental indebtedness, such offering or incurrence would be expected to increase our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional indebtedness will be set at the time of pricing of such incurrence or offering and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will elect to raise any such additional 40 ----- debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt in addition to its current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors”, could intensify.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

The cash proceeds, if any, of any Potential Financing Transactions may be used for the redemption, refinancing, repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness of any member of the Group, the payment of any fees and expenses in connection therewith or the other transactions related thereto, and/or distributions or other payments to direct or indirect parent companies, and for general corporate purposes or, in the case of payables financing transactions, to purchase and extend payment claims attached to our trade payables. The incurrence of indebtedness under any such Potential Financing Transactions would be incurred in compliance with the applicable covenants under the Existing Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Existing Notes. After giving effect to any such incurrence in compliance with the applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to annualized EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA could increase above the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to annualized EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA, respectively, as of September 30, 2021 (each as shown under the heading “Summary Financial and Operating Data—Certain As _Adjusted Covenant Information”), and such increase could be material. Any Potential Financing Transaction will_ be made at our sole election or the election of our relevant subsidiaries, and, if any indebtedness incurred thereunder is in the form of securities, such securities would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate Offering Memorandum or liability management documentation.

519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.5,We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations.,"Our ability to make interest payments on the Notes and the Existing Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations, including under the Existing Credit Facility and the New Finco Facilities or to refinance our debt, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material assets. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations under the Notes and the Existing Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of our debts. See “Description of Other Indebtedness of VodafoneZiggo”. Our ability to implement such a refinancing successfully would be significantly dependent on stable debt capital markets. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain sufficient cash flow in the future for the payment of principal or interest on our indebtedness when due. Consequently, we may be forced to raise cash or reduce expenses by doing one or more of the following: - raising additional debt; - restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness prior to maturity and/or on unfavorable terms; 41 ----- - selling or disposing of some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms; - issuing equity or equity-related instruments that will dilute the equity ownership interest of existing stockholders; or - foregoing business opportunities, including the introduction of new products and services, acquisitions and joint ventures. We cannot be sure that any of, or a combination of, the above actions would be sufficient to fund our debt service obligations, particularly in times of turbulent capital markets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627
519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.6,We are subject to debt covenants that could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.,"The indentures governing the Existing Notes, and other agreements governing our indebtedness (including the Existing Credit Facility) contain covenants that significantly restrict our ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; - pay, make equity distributions to shareholders, redeem capital stock and make certain investments; - make certain other restricted payments; - create or permit to exist certain liens; - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay, make equity distributions to shareholders or make other payments to us; - transfer, lease or sell certain assets including subsidiary stock; - merge or consolidate with other entities; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into unrelated businesses; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Existing Notes and the lenders under the Existing Credit Facility. All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay, make equity distributions to shareholders, make investments or to make significant prepayments of related-party debt. However, these covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under the agreements governing our debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement and could trigger acceleration of the related debt. Such a default or acceleration could in turn trigger defaults under other agreements governing our debt. A default under the agreements governing our other debt could materially adversely affect our growth, our financial condition and results of operations and result in us not having sufficient assets to fulfil the obligations under the New Finco Facilities (an in turn under the Notes) or the relevant series of Existing Notes.

519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.7,We are exposed to interest rate risks and other adverse changes in the credit market. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations.,"We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates (e.g. as a consequence of inflation and central banks raising interest rates), could increase our cost of borrowing and capital (which will in turn increase the likelihood of an impairment) and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. In particular, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Existing Credit Facility and through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries, which are indexed to the Euro Interbank 42 ----- Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or other base rates (including the euro short-term rate). Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627
519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile,13.1.8,"The phasing out of LIBOR and EURIBOR will result in a new reference rate being applied to our LIBOR indexed and EURIBOR-indexed debt which may not be the same as the new reference rate applied to our LIBOR-indexed and EURIBOR-indexed derivative instruments, and will have to be adjusted for.","In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Additionally, the European Money Markets Institute (the authority that administers EURIBOR) has announced that measures will need to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform EURIBOR to ensure compliance with the European Union’s Benchmarks Regulation. In November 2020, ICE Benchmark administration (the entity that administers LIBOR) announced its intention to continue publishing USD LIBOR rates until June 30, 2023, with the exception of the one-week and two-month rates which, along with all GBP LIBOR rates, it intends to cease publishing after December 31, 2021. While this extension allows additional flexibility on existing contracts using USD LIBOR rates, companies are still encouraged to transition from using USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and should not enter into new contracts that use USD LIBOR after 2021. The methodology for EURIBOR has been reformed and EURIBOR has been granted regulatory approval to continue to be used. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact transitional arrangements for calculating applicable reference rates that may be made in the U.K., the U.S., Latin America, the Eurozone or elsewhere given that a number of outcomes are possible, including the cessation of the publication of one or more reference rates. In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (the ISDA) launched a new supplement (the Fallback Supplement), which from January 25, 2021, amended the standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain key interbank offered rates (IBORs). The ISDA also launched a new protocol (the Fallback Protocol), also effective January 25, 2021, that enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol. The fallbacks for a particular currency will apply following a permanent cessation of the IBOR in that currency and will be adjusted versions of the risk-free rates identified in each currency. Our credit agreements contain provisions that contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate applicable to our LIBOR-indexed and EURIBOR-indexed debt to the extent LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable) are not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what would have been calculated under LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable). Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that either the LIBOR rate or the EURIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed debt could be different than any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. We anticipate managing this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments. However, future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and/or the company may incur significant associated costs.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Although we generally seek to match the denomination of our borrowings, and the borrowings of our subsidiaries, with the euro, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the euro.

While we regularly review our credit exposures and currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance of default or failure could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (1) we may incur losses to the extent that we are unable to recover debts owed to us, including cash deposited and the value of financial losses, (2) we may incur significant costs to recover amounts owed to us, and such recovery may take a long period of time or may not be possible at all, (3) our derivative liabilities may be accelerated by the default of our counterparty, (4) we may be exposed to financial risks as a result of the termination of affected derivative contracts, and it may be costly or impossible to replace such contracts or otherwise mitigate such risks, (5) amounts available under committed credit facilities may be reduced and (6) disruption to the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all. At September 30, 2021, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (i) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of €11.9 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of €176.9 million and (iii) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of €800.0 million. Furthermore, under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination. However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty. Furthermore, the underlying risks that are the subject of the relevant derivative contracts would no longer be effectively hedged due to the insolvency of our counterparty, unless and until we novate or replace the derivative contract. In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty. However, no assurance can be given that the relevant regulators would in fact do so or that such actions would not result in substantial costs to us.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephone and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. We compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our business faces significant competition. 44 ----- For all our services, we compete with the provision of similar services from other operators such as Koninklijke KPN N.V. (“KPN”), T-Mobile Netherlands B.V. (“T-Mobile” as of January 2019 merged with Tele2 Netherlands Holding B.V.) and smaller parties. KPN and other competitors use KPN’s fixed network and offer (i) internet protocol television over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as “FTTx”) networks and through broadband internet connections using DSL or very high-speed DSL technology (“VDSL”), KPN’s network also offers several enhancements to VDSL, such as “vectoring” and “pair bonding”, and (ii) digital terrestrial television . Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it allows for offers of broadband internet with download speeds of 200 Mbps and on its FTTx networks, it allows for download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. The ability of competitors to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services, creates significant competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. The video services of competitors include many of the interactive features we offer our subscribers. Portions of our network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue as our competitors accelerate their FTTx network roll-out and expect to overbuild our footprint in the next five years. We believe the total FTTH coverage in the Netherlands had reached approximately 50% as of September 30, 2021. We also experience competition from (i) direct-to-home satellite service providers, such as Canal Digital, a subsidiary of M7 Group S.A., (ii) over the top (“OTT”) video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections, and (iii) movie theaters, video stores, video websites and home video products. In addition, we compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/ concerts and sporting events. We compete with mobile operators KPN and T-Mobile in the mobile market, offering 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G services, where pressure on market price continues, characterized by aggressive promotional campaigns, heavy marketing spend, and increasing (data) bundles. Furthermore, there is increasing competition from mobile virtual network operators, some of which focus on niche segments, such as no frills, youth or ethnic markets. While in the business market, we see growing customer demand to provide added value services on top of our connectivity services. These include unified communication solutions with a focus on employee mobility, seamless fixed and mobile transition and digital workspace. Other areas of interest for business-to-business (“B2B”) customers when making the digital transition in their business include domains such as security and Internet of Things solutions. Fixed connectivity services in the high-end business market are also offered by competitors like Eurofiber (nationwide fiber access services) and international service providers such as British Telecom and Colt. In the business segment we also compete with specialist service providers offering “value added services”, mostly in OTT as-a-service models based on hosted cloud technologies. These can be local originated providers such as Voiceworks (hosted voice solutions—part of Enreach group), or international providers with a local presence such as Dean One (hosted voice solutions—part of Gamma Communications U.K.). Large OTT providers such as Microsoft also compete in this domain and are important B2B partners for us in the B2B added-services domain. Changes in market share are driven primarily by the combination of price and quality of services provided. To improve our competitive position, we continuously monitor and update our portfolios. We offer attractive bundle options, plus fixed-mobile convergence options, allowing our subscribers the ability to select various combinations of services to meet their needs. Our competitive strategy with respect to our services includes: - Video services: We include MediaBox XL, MediaBox Next, Replay TV and Movies & Series in our extended digital video tier offers. Ziggo GO is also available, providing subscribers the ability to watch linear and VoD programming through a second or third screen application on smart phones, tablets and laptops and to record programs remotely. In addition, we continue to improve the quality of our programming and modify our video options by offering attractive content packages, such as Ziggo Sport channels. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 1.7 million Mediabox Next customers. - Mobile services: We offer a wide range of 2G, 4G and 5G mobile services and our Community WiFi network. We also continue to invest in our mobile network to improve the availability and quality of our services. 45 ----- - Broadband internet services: The speed of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. In addition, by leveraging our existing fiber rich broadband networks and our network extensions, we are in a position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology. As of September 30, 2021, over 60% of our connected households are now upgraded to 1 Gbps internet speeds using the DOCSIS 3.1 technology. By using DOCSIS 3.1, we can extend our download speeds to at least 1 Gbps where deployed. DOCSIS 3.1 technology improves not only our internet speed offers but also allows for network growth. DOCSIS technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. We also offer the SmartWifi package to enhance our customers’ in-home broadband connection. By end of 2021, we estimate 1 million high-end SmartWiFi pods had been installed at our customers; and - Fixed-line telephony services: We position our services as “anytime”, “anywhere” and “any destination” and offer a variety of calling plans to meet the needs of our customers, such as our unlimited national calling packages, including unlimited calls to fixed and mobile phones. We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants as a result of changes in the Dutch and European regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, advances in technology, the influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and significant price competition.

Significant additions to our property, plant and equipment are or in the future may be, required to add customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and customer-premises equipment (“CPE”) to enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience. Such expansion and improvements require significant capital expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs to build out and/or upgrade our networks as well as for related CPE. New technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase their infrastructure capacity. Additionally, significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and CPE. In addition, no assurance can be given that any rebuilds, upgrades or extensions of our network will increase penetration rates, increase cable or mobile revenues, or otherwise future upgrades will generate positive returns or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades. If our costs are greater than originally anticipated, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our deployment, development and expansion plans or otherwise forgo market opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our debt agreements.

Churn arises mainly as a result of competitive influences, relocation of subscribers, deterioration of personal financial circumstances and price increases. In addition, our customer churn rate may also increase if we are unable to deliver satisfactory services. For example, any interruption or unavailability of our services, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Increased customer churn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Most of our revenue is derived from customers who could be impacted by adverse economic developments globally, in Europe and in the Netherlands. Ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues, among other things, has contributed to a challenging economic environment. The economic environment has been further challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19. Accordingly, unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our customers and, as a result, it may be (i) more difficult for us to attract new customers, (ii) more likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their handsets, tariffs and/or services, (iii) less likely that customers will upgrade their handsets, tariffs and/or services and (iv) more difficult for us to maintain ARPU at existing levels.

We generally do not produce our own content and we depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If we fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay television services, including a sufficient selection of high-definition channels, out-of-home rights and non-linear content (such as video-on-demand, Replay TV and digital video recorder capability), on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling video product to our customers at a price they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and our annual costs for programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming and copyright costs will continue to rise in future periods as a result of, among other factors, higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, and retransmission or copyright fees payable to public broadcasters. If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and future television services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans.

Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, interruptions in production and supply chain systems such as chip shortage, terrorism, labor issues and pandemics (including COVID-19). While it is not currently possible to estimate the duration and severity of COVID-19 or the adverse economic impact resulting from the preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its outbreak, an extended period of global economic disruption could have a material adverse impact on the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in CPE could lead to delays in connecting customers to our services, and accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. Additionally, we rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services.

Some of these are managed, hosted, provided or used by third-party service providers or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. In addition, the hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively small number of locations. Our and our third-party service providers’ systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable to damage or security breach from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts, security flaws, and natural disasters. Moreover, despite security measures, our and our third-party service providers’ servers, systems and equipment are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. We and our third party service providers may not be able to anticipate or respond in an adequate and timely manner to attempts to obtain authorized access to, disable or degrade our or our third party service providers’ systems because the techniques for doing so change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated and are difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, the security measures and procedures we and our third-party service providers have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. In some cases, mitigation efforts may depend on third parties who may not deliver products or services that meet the required contractual standards or whose hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, or outage. Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines, litigation or regulatory actions. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause business disruptions such as failures in our information technology systems, disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks or similar problems. Further, although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.

Further, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to our customers or otherwise meet our business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and an adverse impact on revenue.

With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone countries. Further, the U.K. left the E.U. on February 1, 2020 (“Brexit”). It is possible that members of the European monetary union could hold a similar referendum regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion, or in the extreme case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency measures have been imposed by governments worldwide, including travel restrictions, restrictions on social activity and the shutdown of non-essential businesses. These measures have adversely impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While it is not currently possible to estimate full extent of the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, its duration and severity or resulting from the preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its outbreak, an extended period of global economic disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods, including with respect to, among other items, (i) our ability to access capital necessary to fund property and equipment additions, debt service requirements, acquisitions and other investment opportunities, the repurchase of equity securities or other liquidity needs, (ii) the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services, (iii) our ability to maintain or increase our residential and business subscriber levels, (iv) our ability to offer attractive programming, particularly in consideration of the continuous threat of cancellation of numerous worldwide sporting events, and (v) the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us and (vi) the ability to translate a significant increase of our total cost base (as a result of higher than average supplier prices and employee salary inflation) into higher subscription prices to our customers.

Investments required to implement new guidance and/or restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic may reduce the amount of resources available to us to fund other investments. In addition, countries may seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits that result from measures taken to mitigate the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, such as by imposing new taxes on the products and services we provide. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects on our operational and financial performance, the extent of which will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the impact on the general economy, the impact on our customers and our sales cycles, the impact on the credit risk profiles of our partners, the impact on our employees and the effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. If, among other factors, the adverse impacts stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak, competition, economic, regulatory or other factors, including macro-economic and demographic trends, were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of goodwill or other long-lived assets.

Additionally, our ability to execute on cost-cutting measures and organizational change initiatives may impact our financial performance and results of operations, including lower than anticipated cost savings. For instance, in the event demand for our products or services is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts, we may need to assess different corporate actions, organizational change initiatives and cost-cutting measures, including reducing our workforce, reducing our operating and capital costs or closing one or more of our retail stores, offices or facilities, and these actions could cause us to incur costs and expose us to other risks and inefficiencies.

For example, high levels of sovereign debt, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business. 52 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Investments envisaged by us in companies that are active in telecommunications are increasingly subject to investment screening procedures, which may affect our ability to acquire other undertakings, especially outside the Netherlands. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties. The video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated at the E.U. level. In the Netherlands, these regulations are implemented through the Telecommunicatiewet (the Dutch Telecommunications Act, “DTA”), the Mediawet (the Dutch Media Act, “DMA”) and related legislation and regulations. The ACM, and the Dutch Radiocommunications Agency (“AT”, Agentschap Telecom) supervise and enforce compliance with certain parts of the DTA. Pursuant to the DTA, the ACM is designated as a National Regulatory Authority. The Dutch Media Authority (Commissariaat voor de Media) is authorized to enforce compliance with the DMA. Complying with existing regulations is burdensome, and future changes may increase our operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, the implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (“EECC”) into the DTA will further amend the DTA and will further update and introduce regulation that will impact various aspects of our business, for instance spectrum regulation, symmetrical access and end-users rights. The EECC was partially implemented into the DTA on December 21, 2020. An additional Dutch implementation act of the EECC was approved by the Dutch parliament in October 2021 and is expected to enter into force in the near future. The Dutch Government is in the process of auctioning mobile spectrum licenses in the so-called 3,5 GHz bands, which is currently scheduled to be completed before the end of 2022, which is relevant for our ability to secure sufficient and required spectrum for our mobile service offerings. The Dutch Government has furthermore recently adopted additional requirements relating to the configuration of technical equipment and network, security of technical infrastructure, software and maintenance and human resource security. These measures are set out in the Measure on Security and Integrity Telecommunication (Regeling veiligheid en integriteit telecommunicatie) and must be complied with by October 1, 2022. Macroeconomic events, such as political unrest in international markets, terrorist attacks, malicious human acts, natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics and other similar events may have an adverse effect on our business, and the ability to repay the Notes. In addition to the above, on February 27, 2018, the ACM published a draft decision in its Local Loop Unbundling market analysis, now referred to as Wholesale Fixed Access (“WFA”) in which it aims to regulate VodafoneZiggo by imposing an obligation to offer wholesale broadband access on the cable network on national level in addition to continuing existing regulation on KPN, as well as a prohibition on KPN and VodafoneZiggo to request regulated access to each other’s networks, unless such access does not have the object or effect of restricting competition, as well as related obligations on non-discrimination, transparency and price regulation. Following a market consultation, the ACM notified the draft decision to the European Commission. On August 31, 2018, the European Commission responded, providing comments on three elements (market definition, proportionality and suitable price regulation mechanisms). The ACM then published a final decision on September 27, 2018, which entered into force October 1, 2018. VodafoneZiggo, KPN, T-Mobile and Tele2 appealed ACM’s decision. The appeal of ACM’s decision was successful. On March 17, 2020, the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal (“CBb”) upheld the appeal by KPN and VodafoneZiggo and annulled ACM’s decision. The Court’s verdict is final. As a result, VodafoneZiggo is not obligated to offer wholesale broadband access on the cable network. Also, KPN is no longer obligated to offer regulated access. KPN has announced it will continue offering access under commercial conditions. On July 9, 2021, ACM announced that it had investigated, over the course of the preceding months, the fixed consumer and business markets. According to the 53 ----- press release, the ACM considers that there is a risk that access conditions by KPN for consumers may impede competition. The ACM therefore intends to prepare a market analysis decision to determine whether access to fixed telecom networks must be regulated and if so, how. The ACM intends to publish a draft decision by the end of the first quarter of 2022. Before a final decision is published, there will be a market consultation and notification to the European Commission. The ACM may also review whether symmetric access regulation is required. The ACM has received a request for symmetric access on our fixed network and is currently assessing this request. The ACM may impose additional access obligations on the basis of the EECC as to be implemented in the DTA. Our operations, and therefore the ability of the Existing Credit Facility Obligors to repay the New Finco Loans and, in turn, the Issuer’s ability to repay the Notes, are subject to macroeconomic risks, including but not limited to political unrest, instability in international markets, terrorist attacks, malicious human acts, natural disasters, pandemics and epidemics, that are outside of our control.

In addition, the Existing Credit Facility will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, which may also be secured, and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Consequently, creditors of such additional indebtedness are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Existing Credit Facility Guarantor.

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, Dutch insolvency law. Dutch insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, applicable insolvency laws in such jurisdictions and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts would limit the enforceability of judgments against such Existing Credit Facility Obligors. The following discussion of insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdictions’ insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Existing Credit Facility Guarantors or an appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Existing Credit Facility Guarantees, and intercompany 61 ----- obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of an Existing Credit Facility Guarantor’s obligations under its Existing Credit Facility Guarantee; - direct that the Ziggo Lenders (including the Issuer) return any amounts paid under an Existing Credit Facility Guarantee to the relevant Existing Credit Facility Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the relevant Existing Credit Facility Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to the Ziggo Lenders (including the Issuer) and, indirectly, holders of the Notes. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether an Existing Credit Facility Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Existing Credit Facility Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that an Existing Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not an Existing Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Existing Credit Facility Guarantee was issued, that payments to the Issuer under the New Finco Loans to, in turn, make payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Insolvency Regulation”), a company’s location of its centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the company did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings. The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and the Existing Credit Facility Obligors (other than Ziggo Financing Partnership) are incorporated in the Netherlands and have their statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands. Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to the Issuer and such Existing Credit Facility Obligors, primary proceedings would likely be initiated in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws may make it difficult or impossible to effect a restructuring. If the Issuer’s or such Existing Credit Facility Obligors’ COMI was found to be in another E.U. jurisdiction and not in the Netherlands, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, suspension of payments (surseance _van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable a company to continue as_ a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Upon commencement of suspension of payments proceedings, the court will grant a provisional suspension. A definitive suspension will generally be granted in a creditors’ meeting called for that purpose, unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent or if there is no prospect that the company will in the future be able to pay its debts as they fall due (in which case the company will generally be declared bankrupt). During a suspension of payments, unsecured and non-preferential creditors will be precluded from attempting to recover their claims from the assets of the company. A suspension of payments is subject to exceptions, the most important of which excludes secured creditors and preferential creditors (such as tax and social security authorities and employees) from the application of the suspension. This implies that during suspension of payments proceedings secured creditors may proceed against the assets that secure their claims to satisfy their claims, and preferential creditors are also not barred from seeking to recover their claims. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. In a suspension of payments, a composition 62 ----- (akkoord) may be offered by the company to its creditors. Such a composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, irrespective whether they voted in favor or against it or whether they were represented at the creditor’s meeting called for the purpose of voting on the composition plan, if (i) it is approved by more than 50% in number of the general unsecured and non-preferential creditors present or represented at the creditor’s meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the general unsecured and non-preferential claims admitted for voting purposes and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to a company’s creditors on a pari passu basis. Certain creditors (such as secured creditors and preferential creditors) have special rights that may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the respective New Finco Loans. For example, a Dutch bankruptcy does not prohibit secured creditors from taking recourse against the encumbered assets of the bankrupt debtor to satisfy their claims. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the potential recovery of a holder of the Notes or the Issuer, as lender under the respective New Finco Loans in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. To obtain payment on unsecured non-preferential claims, such claims need to be submitted to the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) for verification. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the trustee verifies the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it may be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of holders of the Notes which were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or, in the case of the New Finco Loans, the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Existing Credit Facility Obligor, are only admissible for verification for their net present value if they mature more than one year after opening of the bankruptcy. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the trustee of the Issuer for verification. Creditors that wish to dispute the valuation of their claims by the trustee will need to commence a court proceeding. These verification procedures could result in holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the relevant New Finco Loans, receiving a right to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or amounts owed under such New Finco Loans, as the case may be. In addition, in a Dutch bankruptcy in practice usually no or little funds remain available for the payment of unsecured and non-preferential creditors. In a bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to the unsecured and non-preferential creditors. Such a composition will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of a meeting of the recognized and admitted creditors representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the admitted claims and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. On October 6, 2020 the Dutch legislator has adopted a bill for the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord), with the aim to implement a restructuring instrument enabling companies in financial distress to restructure their debts without the need to initiate formal insolvency procedures (such as bankruptcy or moratorium of payments). The bill has entered into force on January 1, 2021. The goal of the new legislation is to introduce a preventive restructuring procedure enabling debtors in financial difficulties to restructure at an early stage and avoid insolvency. A restructuring plan under the new legislation can be proposed by a debtor who foresees that it will not be able to continue paying its due and payable debts (the debts as they fall due). Under such circumstances, the debtor or a court appointed restructuring specialist may offer a restructuring plan to the debtor’s creditors and shareholders. A restructuring plan could propose an amendment or (partial) discharge of the rights and claims of all creditors and shareholders involved. Once approved and confirmed by the relevant percentage of creditors and the court, such restructuring plan is binding on all creditors and shareholders involved. Subject to certain safeguards, creditors and shareholders who have voted against the restructuring plan could be (cross-) crammed down and thus be bound by the restructuring plan. Taking into account the provisions in the act, claims against a debtor can, inter alia, be (partially) discharged or extended as a result of a restructuring plan if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a plan and the court subsequently approves the plan. As a consequence of the foregoing, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the recovery of holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the New Finco Loans, in a Dutch insolvency proceeding. 63 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of bankruptcy, the so-called actio pauliana provisions. The actio pauliana offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

A Change of Control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of the Notes, the Existing Notes and other indebtedness.

For purposes of the Volcker Rule, a “banking entity” is defined to include: (i) any U.S. insured depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1813)), subject to certain exclusions; (ii) any company that controls a 68 ----- U.S. insured depository institution; (iii) any non-U.S. company that is treated as a bank holding company for purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (i.e., a foreign bank that maintains a branch, agency or commercial lending office in the U.S.); and (iv) any affiliate or subsidiary of any entity described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (and the rules, regulations and published guidance thereunder), other than a “covered fund” that is not itself a banking entity under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). The definition of “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule includes, in part, any issuer that would be an investment company under the 1940 Act but for the exclusions provided under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on the exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it will be considered a covered fund for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. In the event the Issuer is considered a “covered fund”, “banking entities” that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer, unless such banking entity is able to rely on an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. “Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule as “any equity, partnership, or other similar interest”. The Notes are not equity or partnership interests. The phrase “other similar interest” is further defined under the Volcker Rule as an interest that: (A) has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event and the right to participate in the removal of an investment manager for “cause” or participate in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal, with “cause” having the meaning set forth in 12 CFR §248.10(d)(6)(i)(A)(2)); (B) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the covered fund; (C) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (D) has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests); (E) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; (F) receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or (G) any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above.

The Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors that may affect the value of the Notes. The Second Party Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is only current as of the date it is released.

We do not assume any obligation or responsibility to release any update or revision to the Sustainability-Linked Finance Framework and/or information to reflect events or circumstances after the date of publication of such Sustainability-Linked Finance Framework and, therefore, an update or a revision of the Second Party Opinion may or may not be requested from Sustainalytics or other providers of second party opinions. Moreover, Sustainalytics and providers of similar opinions and certifications are not currently subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight. Any such opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer, or any member of the Group, the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion providers or any other person to buy, sell or hold the Notes. Holders of the Notes have no recourse against the Issuer, any of the Initial Purchasers or the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such opinion or certification, which is only current as at the date it was initially issued.

The Notes are not being marketed as green bonds since we expect to use the relevant net proceeds to redeem the 2027 Senior Secured Notes and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. Therefore, we do not intend to allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities meeting environmental or sustainability criteria, or be subject to any other limitations associated with green bonds. In addition, the interest rate adjustment in respect of the Notes depends on GHG Emissions (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”) that may be inconsistent with investor requirements or expectations or other definitions relevant to GHG Emissions. If no Second Party Opinion is obtained, there might be no third-party analysis of GHG Emissions. Even though we have obtained the Second Party Opinion, there currently are no clearly-defined definitions (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to, what constitutes a “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” or equivalently-labelled project or as to what precise attributes are required for a particular project to be defined as “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time). As a result, no assurance is or can be given to investors by the Issuer, any other member of the Group, the Initial Purchasers, external reviewer or any second party opinion providers that the Notes will meet any or all investor expectations or our targets qualifying as “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” or that any other adverse impacts will not occur in connection with our striving to achieve such targets.

The standards and guidelines continue to be reviewed by expert groups and include contributions from industry bodies, which may change going forward. In such case, we will recalculate, in good faith, the levels of the relevant baseline, Sustainability Performance Target and/or key performance indicators to reflect such changes. Any such change(s) may be made without the prior consultation of the holders of the Notes, to the extent it does not have a material adverse effect on the interest of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Sustainability _Adjustments.” We expect to report on an annual basis on progress on our key performance indicators, but a_ failure to do so will not constitute a default or event of default under the Notes or any other agreement. The Group will have the right to make amendments to the Baseline GHG Emissions (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”) in case of any merger and acquisition activities or changes to the calculation methodology for the KPIs, which are appropriate in light of such activity or change and the nature of such KPI. The adjustment mechanism allows for a revision of the Baseline GHG Emissions. As discussed, any such changes will be made without the prior consultation of the holders of the Notes to the extent such changes do not have a material adverse effect on the interests of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes— _Principal, Maturity and Interest—Sustainability Performance Targets Step-up Interest.” Moreover, the Issuer has_ no obligation to modify or otherwise change the Baseline GHG Emissions in the future.

The Issuer will not be entitled to make any modifications to the terms of the Notes which would have the effect of reducing the principal amount of the Notes or reducing the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on the Notes, without the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. See “Description of the _Notes”._ The Indenture, the Transaction Documents and the Notes Security Document Documents do not confer upon the holders of the Notes any synthetic rights to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above. Effective as of October 1, 2020, the Volcker Rule was amended to exclude from the definition of “ownership interest” any “senior loan or senior debt interest” that has the following characteristics: (1) Under the terms of the interest the holders of such interest do not have the right to receive a share of the income, gains, or profits of the covered fund, but are entitled to receive only: (i) Interest at a stated interest rate, as well as commitment fees or other fees, which are not determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; and (ii) Repayment of a fixed principal amount, on or before a maturity date, in a contractually determined manner (which may include prepayment premiums intended solely to reflect, and compensate holders of the interest for, forgone income resulting from an early prepayment); 70 ----- (2) The entitlement to payments under the terms of the interest are absolute and could not be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, writedowns or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; and (3) The holders of the interest are not entitled to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event). For the reasons discussed above, while it is possible that the Notes could be characterized as senior debt interests having the characteristics described in clauses (1) through (3) above, there can be no assurances given as to whether the Notes will be excluded from the scope of the definition of “ownership interest”. Before making an investment in the Notes, each potential investor in the Notes should consult with its own counsel and make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, whether the Notes constitute “ownership interests”, whether any exclusion or exemption under the Volcker Rule might be applicable to an investment in the Notes by such investor, whether its investment in the Notes would be restricted or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its investment, any liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally. See “Transfer Restrictions”. None of VodafoneZiggo, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Trustee, nor any of their respective affiliates, makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the treatment of the Issuer or the Notes under the Volcker Rule or to the impact of the Volcker Rule on such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future. The Volcker Rule and any similar measures introduced in another relevant jurisdiction may impact the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market or restrict prospective investors’ ability to hold the Notes. Each purchaser is responsible for analyzing its own regulatory position under the Volcker Rule and any similar measures.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully the specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum, as well as the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Offering Memorandum. If any of the risks described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Notes, the Existing Credit Facility Obligors’ ability to pay all or part of the interest, principal or other amounts on the New Finco Loans and, in turn, the Issuer’s ability to pay all or part of the interest, principal or other amounts on the Notes. Although the risk factors described below and elsewhere in this document are the risks considered to be the most material, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

We use our strong position within the market to exert a positive influence on all of the links within that chain, from suppliers right through to consumers. The route that our products and services need to take before reaching customers must be both responsible and sustainable. This means, among other things, that everyone must be able to work safely and receive a fair wage and that we must safeguard the environment as much as possible, but also that we handle the privacy, security and health of our customers carefully. We realise that due to the size of our organisation, we can have a significant positive impact by means of our purchasing power. That is why we make sure that an everincreasing number of the products we buy are sustainable and why we work hard to make our procurement process more sustainable. Everything we purchase must fulfil our sustainable and ethical standards, as detailed in our Code of Sustainable and Ethical Purchasing, and we make agreements about the compliance of the code with our suppliers. Those agreements are not only about environmental impact, but also relate to working conditions, fair 142 ----- wages and safety. For example, we only purchase certified energy generated by European wind turbines. Whenever we collaborate with subcontractors to further expand our GigaNet, we make agreements about worker safety. In 2020, our suppliers carried out more than 250 workplace inspections during activities with a high-risk profile. These activities include working at heights, working in confined spaces and working with electricity. Furthermore, we collaborate closely with EcoVadis to ensure that we have greater transparency and reliable CSR insights into our supply chain. Subsequently, we can focus on improving the CSR performance of our supply chain by challenging our suppliers and creating an increasing awareness among them. This enables us to increase our indirect impact on the chain and to accelerate the shift towards a sustainable future. All EcoVadis scores will be considered when making purchase decisions. Our CSR insights and the CSR performance of our suppliers will thus play a big role in how and with whom we do business. In short, VodafoneZiggo is committed to its Corporate Sustainability, focusing on the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies to ensure a more sustainable business performance. We believe that ESG driven decision making drives a more sustainable business performance. Within our Energy Management Program we maximize energy efficiency, savings and innovations by effectively managing all energy related topics, including: processes, projects, tools and contracts: - We are committed to achieve a 2% energy efficiency improvement every year and to deliver more than 280 terajoule of energy savings by 2025; - We are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and we use 100% wind energy; - We offer an unlimited Dutch public transport card for all employees to encourage and promote the use of public transport. Around 80% of our employees actively make use of this facility; and - E-waste management is seen as a shared responsibility and as a result we refurbish set-up boxes and modems and use eco-friendly packaging. We also offer a financial incentive to customers for selling their old smart phones back to us. Data security is an important social topic and we have policies and procedures in place to comply with the applicable regulations related to processing personal data of our customers and employee. Furthermore, as part of CSR governance, we have established a CSR committee overseeing the delivery of the “People, Planet, Progress” program throughout VodafoneZiggo. 143 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

To this end, we launched our new CSR strategy in 2020, under the title “People, Planet, Progress”. We have set two goals for 2025: to halve our impact on the environment and to help two million people move forward in society. The strategy is characterised by an integrated approach in which the entire organisation will contribute to achieving the goals, under the governance and oversight of our CSR committee. Building on these two goals for 2025 and our commitment to the SBTi, we plan to further eliminate our own carbon emissions and set a net zero commitment across our entire value chain. We expect to announce this ambition in mid-2022. We view CSR as an integral part of our entire strategy and business operations, as something that is high on the agenda with all our people. As CSR is integral to our business operations, our departments will contribute to the realisation of the goals on a day-to-day basis.

In addition, each New Finco Facilities Accession Agreement will provide for the payment of certain premiums in connection with certain voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the applicable New Finco Loan that will enable the Issuer to pay the premiums applicable to corresponding redemptions of the applicable Notes, as described below under “—Redemption and Repurchase”. Each Finco Facilities Accession Agreement will also include the consent of the Issuer to certain amendments under the Existing Credit Facility if the borrowers seek a consent to those amendments from the Credit Facility Lenders, as described below under “—New Finco Facilities Accession Agreements and the Existing Credit Facility”. Each New Finco Facilities Accession Agreement will constitute a “Finance Document” for purposes of the Existing Credit Facility. Each New Finco Facilities Accession Agreement will further provide that the Issuer will accede to the Priority Agreement as a Credit Facility Lender and will be bound by the terms and provisions of the Priority Agreement in its capacity as a lender. See “Description of Other Indebtedness of VodafoneZiggo—Intercreditor _Agreements—Group Priority Agreement”._ Under the Existing Credit Facility, Credit Facility Lenders are not allowed to split or divide their votes with respect to matters arising thereunder requiring the vote (or other consent) of Credit Facility Lenders. For a description of procedures under the Indenture regarding voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to decisions under the Existing Credit Facility, see below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Existing Credit Facility or the New Finco Facilities Accession Agreements”. The Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other Credit Facility Lenders under the Existing Credit Facility. In the event that the Issuer, as a Credit Facility Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent) (including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter arising from time to time under the Existing Credit Facility or under the New Finco Facilities Accession Agreements, as applicable, in which all Credit Facility Lenders or the Issuer are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of the Notes and any other applicable series of Additional Debt with respect to such Existing Credit Facility Decision (as defined below) in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the Existing Credit Facility or the New Finco _Facilities Accession Agreements” and “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under Existing Credit Facility Loan Documents”.

The Issuer will therefore apply Noteholder Consent (as defined below) equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding in respect of any of the Existing Credit Facility Amendments for the purposes of the provisions of the Indenture described below under “—Amendment, Supplement _and Waiver—To the Existing Credit Facility or the New Finco Facilities Accession Agreements” and “—Certain Covenants—Minimum Period for Consents under Existing Credit Facility Loan Documents”.

Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes. Any notice of Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default or notice of acceleration, or to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default, may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may waive all past defaults (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences if (a) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, (b) all existing Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived and (c) the Issuer has paid the Trustee its compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for its properly incurred expenses, disbursements and advances. Following acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, the Lien over the Issuer Collateral will become enforceable, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement (a “CSA Enforcement Event”). Following a CSA Enforcement Event under the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement, pursuant to each New Finco Facilities Accession Agreement, the VodafoneZiggo Borrower will consent to any assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or obligations (in whole or in part) of each New Finco Loan, including any subsequent assignment, transfer or novation of each New Finco Loan, subject to minimum transfer amount of $200,000 principal amount (in the case of Finco Dollar Loan) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of Finco Euro Loan), as applicable, and other requirements of a Credit Facility Lender under the Existing Credit Facility. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of the Notes, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee indemnity or security or prefunding satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts (if any) when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 50% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holder has offered the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee reasonable security or indemnity or prefunding satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and 184 ----- (5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as applicable, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use under the circumstances in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with Law, the Indenture, the Collateral Sharing Agreement or any Additional Collateral Sharing Agreement or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of Notes or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security or indemnification or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must give notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes. With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists”, “is continuing” or similar expressions with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the applicable person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the terms of the Indenture or any Transaction Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under the Indenture and the Transaction Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture and the Transaction Documents.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Information”, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available). Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, book-entry interests may be transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a book-entry interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a book-entry interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a book-entry interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for book-entry interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Definitive Registered Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”. This paragraph refers to transfers and exchanges with respect to Dollar Global Notes only. Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S book-entry interest for Rule 144A book-entry interest in a Dollar Global Note will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the registrar through the DTC Deposit/ Withdrawal at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding Rule 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of unrestricted book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period. Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a book-entry interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a book-entry interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a book-entry interest.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each Clearing System are controlled by that Clearing System and may be changed at any time. Neither we, nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law, - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law, - a member of the Federal Reserve System, - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. 207 ----- Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

Book-entry interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Dollar Global Notes and the Euro Global Notes, cross market transfers of interests in the Dollar Global Notes and the Euro Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers with respect to interests in Dollar Global Notes between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by the common depositary, however, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes from DTC, and making and receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depositary. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC, will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC, but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may 208 ----- be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. The book-entry interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date. 209 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

See “—Principal, Maturity and Interest”. Except as otherwise stated herein, the Notes will be treated as a single class of Notes under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers and amendments. As a result, among other things, holders of the Notes will not have separate and independent rights to give notice of a Default or to direct the Trustee to exercise remedies in the event of a Default with respect to the Notes or otherwise. The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, and refers to the Existing Credit Facility, the New Finco Facilities Accession Agreements, the New Finco Facilities Deed of Covenant, the New Finco Facility Fee Letters, the Expenses Agreement, the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Issuer Capitalization Proceeds Loan and the Notes Security Documents (each as defined below).

In such case, U.S. Holders would be treated as holding equity in the Issuer. If the Notes are treated as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders would likely be subject to adverse tax consequences, including those under the passive foreign investment company rules pursuant to which (i) all or a portion of any gain on disposition of the Notes would be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain, (ii) a deferred interest charge would apply to such gain and on certain distributions on the Notes and (iii) a U.S. Holder would be required to comply with certain reporting requirements.

The Issuer believes, and_ intends to take the position if required, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments in light of, among other things, the possibility of such payments or redemptions. This position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance of the Notes, of such payments or redemptions. Assuming such position is respected, any payments of Additional Amounts should be taxable as additional ordinary income when received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S federal income tax purposes, and any premium paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to any repurchase or redemption would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition _by a U.S. Holder”. The IRS may, however, take a position contrary to the position described above, which could_ affect the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Notes. A U.S. Holder that desires to take the position that the Notes are subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules should consult with its tax advisor, including regarding the manner in which to disclose such position as required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations; the IRS may disagree with such holder’s contrary position.

Payments of qualified stated interest on the Notes (including any Additional Amounts and without reduction for any taxes withheld) generally will be includable in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or other property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate. 211 ----- In the case of the Euro Notes, stated interest paid in euros (including the amount of any withholding tax thereon) will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euros regardless of whether the euros are converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder generally will not realize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros received. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will determine the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest income using the average rate of exchange for the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate used in translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S. Holder will be an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above) regardless of whether the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source provided that the residence of a taxpayer is considered to be the United States for purposes of the rules regarding foreign currency gain or loss. Interest including original issue discount (“OID”), if any, included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific “baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The amount of OID a U.S. Holder should include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the Note is held by such U.S. Holder. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period) and (2) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments received on the Note that were not qualified stated interest. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the final accrual period. Under the Treasury Regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to 212 ----- include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor. U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and yield to maturity by contacting the Managing Director, Boven Vredenburgpassage 128, 3511WR Utrecht, The Netherlands. Any OID on a Euro Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such a Note or otherwise), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner as stated interest received by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules.

Depending on the circumstances surrounding such alterations or transactions, a change in the obligor of the Notes as a result of any such alteration or transaction could result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes to a U.S. Holder, potentially resulting in the recognition of taxable gain or loss, with the modified note being treated as newly issued at such time, potentially with OID.

If a U.S. Holder purchases a Euro Note with euros, the U.S. dollar cost of the Euro Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. The amount realized upon the disposition of a Euro Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount received on the date of the disposition calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the Euro Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) should determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on the Euro Note by translating the amount paid or received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as applicable. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the purchase and disposition of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is 213 ----- attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Euro Note. Such foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Euro Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Euro Note.

519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.1,,107.1.1,,"The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, including, without limitation, entities such as collective investment funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general accounts, and entities whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan under ERISA. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws (as defined below). Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under Section 3(14) of ERISA or “disqualified persons” under Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may have to be rescinded. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Even if none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee is a party in interest or a disqualified person, a prohibited transaction may arise if the fiduciary authorizing the investment has an interest in or affiliation with any of the foregoing parties that may affect his, her or its judgment as a fiduciary. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14, as amended (relating to transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset managers), (collectively, the “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a person that is a party in interest solely by reason of being a service provider to a Plan investing in the Notes for adequate consideration or an affiliate of such service provider, provided such service provider or affiliate is not a fiduciary with respect to the Plan’s assets used to acquire the Notes or an affiliate of such fiduciary (the “Service Provider Exemption”). “Adequate consideration” means fair market as determined in good faith by the Plan fiduciary pursuant to regulations to be promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions, the Service Provider Exemption or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. “Governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”). The purchase of the Notes using the assets of a Plan might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or their respective affiliates is the sponsor of, or Fiduciary to, such Plan in the absence of an applicable exemption. 218 ----- EACH ACQUIRER AND EACH TRANSFEREE OF A NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE THAT AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN THAT (1) EITHER (A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS THIS NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF OF) (I) AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF PART 4 OF SUBTITLE B OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR OTHER PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE APPLIES, OR (III) AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE “PLAN ASSETS” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF 29 C.F.R.

Because of the restrictions contained in the front of this Offering Memorandum, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes. The Notes are offered when, as and if issued, subject to prior sale or withdrawal, cancellation or modification of the offer without notice and subject to approval of certain legal matters by counsel and certain other conditions. 221 ----- Persons into whose hands this Offering Memorandum comes are required by the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver Notes or have in their possession, distribute or publish this Offering Memorandum or any other offering material relating to the Notes, in all cases at their own expense. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of the subsidiaries of VodafoneZiggo, and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering in connection with the 2027 Senior Secured Notes Redemption. In addition, VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates have hedged, and are likely to hedge in the future, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending, cash management and capital markets services for VodafoneZiggo, and Liberty Global and Vodafone, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates provide VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and may act as counterparties to certain hedging agreements entered into by VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates and such parties will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/ or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the drawings made pursuant to the Existing Credit Facility and are parties to certain hedging arrangements with VodafoneZiggo and/ or its respective subsidiaries. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are party to certain hedging arrangements and may be counterparties to certain cross-currency/interest rate swap contracts that we may enter into with respect to the Notes.

519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.2,,25.2.1,,"The Issuer has agreed to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions in the purchase agreement relating to the Notes between, inter alios, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has agreed to sell to each of the Initial Purchasers, and each of the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the relevant Notes if any of them are purchased. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Initial Purchasers, the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €2,100 million (equivalent). The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer each of the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed that: (1) subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Securities Exchange Commission a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Notes offered hereby, issued by the Issuer, having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue of the Notes, without the prior written consent of BofA Securities Europe SA with respect to the Euro Notes and BofA Securities, Inc. with respect to the Dollar Notes, for a period of 30 days after the Time of Sale (as defined in the Purchase Agreement); and (2) the Issuer will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchase of securities. Each purchaser of Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions”. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that that it will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers in reliance on Rule 144A and (B) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions”. Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC, and therefore may not make sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that any such Initial Purchaser intends to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so only through one or more affiliated U.S. registered broker dealers, or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law. The Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Note to the public. In connection with sales outside the United States (other than sales pursuant to Rule 144A), the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the Notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such Notes during such Distribution Compliance Period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. 220 ----- In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and applicable rules of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (and implementing and delegated regulations thereunder). Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Managers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of the pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

The purchaser has had access to such financial and other information as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information from the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, and it has received and reviewed all information that it requested.

Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation and the U.K. PRIIPS Regulation for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the U.K. may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation or the U.K. PRIIPS Regulation. 224 ----- Each purchaser acknowledges that each certificate representing a note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect: THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), AND HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION AND THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account. (10) The purchaser represents that (i) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any employee benefits plan or similar arrangement or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes by it will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or a violation under any applicable similar laws. (11) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth hereunder. (12) The purchaser understands that the Issuer will likely be a “covered fund” as defined in the Volcker Rule. The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an “investment company” under the 1940 Act, but for the exclusions provided under 226 ----- Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it will be considered a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. Accordingly, in the event the Issuer is considered a “covered fund”, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer as a “covered fund”, unless such “banking entity” is able to rely on an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, “ownership interest” is broadly defined to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest. The phrase “other similar interest” is further defined under the Volcker Rule to include any interest that: (a) has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event and the right to participate in the removal of an investment manager for “cause” or participate in the selection of a replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal, with “cause” having the meaning set forth in 12 CFR §248.10(d)(6)(i)(A)(2)); (b) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the covered fund; (c) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (d) has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests); (e) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; (f) receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in (a) through (f) above. The Volcker Rule excludes from the definition of “ownership interest” any “senior loan or senior debt interest” that has the following characteristics: (1) under the terms of the interest the holders of such interest do not have the right to receive a share of the income, gains, or profits of the covered fund, but are entitled to receive only: (i) interest at a stated interest rate, as well as commitment fees or other fees, which are not determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; and (ii) repayment of a fixed principal amount, on or before a maturity date, in a contractually determined manner (which may include prepayment premiums intended solely to reflect, and compensate holders of the interest for, forgone income resulting from an early prepayment); (2) the entitlement to payments under the terms of the interest are absolute and could not be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; and (3) the holders of the interest are not entitled to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event).",N/A,as_expected,2022,627
519_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.1,ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS The Netherlands,27.1.1,,"The Issuer as well as certain Existing Credit Facility Guarantors are a Dutch company. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Issuer or the relevant Existing Credit Facility Guarantors. The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court. A final judgment by a U.S. court, however, may under current practice be given binding effect, if and to the extent that the Dutch court finds that (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based on grounds that are internationally acceptable, (ii) the judgment by the U.S. court was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) the judgment by the U.S. court is not incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in the Netherlands and (iv) the final judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Dutch law. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). 230 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,627

This Schedule addresses the manner in which the Security Principles will impact on the guarantees and security proposed to be taken in relation to this transaction. (b) The Security Principles embody recognition by all Parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security from all Obligors and third party security providers (together the “Security Providers”) in every jurisdiction in which the Security Providers are incorporated. In particular: (i) general statutory limitations (including, but not limited to, with respect to the relevant jurisdictions for which guarantee limitation language is set out in Clauses 31.9 (Guarantee _Limitations—Dutch) and 31.10 (Limitation of Liabilities of United States Guarantors) of_ this Agreement, such limitations as set out therein), regulatory requirements or restrictions, tax restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and “capital maintenance” rules, retention of title claims, employee or works council consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a Security Provider to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the enforcement of the guarantee or security be limited by or to an amount or otherwise; if any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant Security Provider may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence); additional guarantee limitations may be included in any Accession Notice where required in connection with the accession of a new Obligor; (ii) guarantees and security will not be required from or over the shares in, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement or any person which is neither an Obligor nor a Holding Company of an Obligor; (iii) third party security providers will not be required to provide any guarantees; (iv) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the cost to the Bank Group of providing such security (including any increase to the tax and/or regulatory costs of the Bank Group) so as to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, those costs are proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Finance Parties; (v) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by this Agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security document; (vi) if there are third party arrangements in place in respect of any asset, business or person acquired by the Bank Group (where those third party arrangements were not entered into in contemplation of that acquisition) as a result of which the consent of a third party is required for that acquired person to provide a guarantee or to secure any acquired asset, such guarantee and/or security will not be required to be granted; (vii) Security Providers will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant Security Provider shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle; (viii) the granting of guarantees, perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Finance Documents thereof or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection or as otherwise set out in this Schedule; (ix) the granting of guarantees, security or perfection of security will not be required if (1) it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Security Provider to A-159 ----- conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted or not prohibited by the Finance Documents or (2) it would be either impossible or impractical or would unduly disrupt the business of the relevant Security Provider and, in each such event, a guarantee will not be granted and/or security will not be taken over such assets, as applicable (including, without limitation, notification of such security to any third party); (x) the Security Agent on behalf of each of the Lenders shall be able, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enforce the security constituted by the security documents without any restriction from either (i) the constitutional documents of the relevant Security Provider or (ii) any Security Provider which is or whose assets are the subject of such security document (but subject to any inalienable statutory rights which the Security Provider may have to challenge such enforcement) or (iii) any shareholders of the foregoing not party to the relevant security document; (xi) the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties, provided that no maximum secured amount may be limited to minimise any taxes imposed pursuant to section 956 of the Code; (xii) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will, subject to this sub-paragraph (b), be granted over the material assets only; (xiii) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of a Security Provider or under English law all security (other than share security over its subsidiaries) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Security Provider; (xiv) guarantee limitations may mean that access to the assets of a Security Provider for its guarantee is limited, in which case, any asset security granted by that Security Provider shall be proportionate (in terms of liability) to the value of its guarantee; (xv) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Security Providers or material assets are not located; (xvi) local law restrictions may mean that the Lenders may not be able to benefit from the same security; (xvii) the Security Agent will hold one set of security for the Lenders; (xviii) under the Dutch Works Council Act certain Dutch members of the Bank Group may not, without the advice of their works council, inter alia resolve to enter into any transaction effectuating: (A) the attraction of an important credit on behalf of the relevant Dutch members of the Bank Group; (B) the provision of an important credit by such Dutch members of the Bank Group; (C) the granting of guarantees and security by the relevant Dutch members of the Bank Group for important debts of another entrepreneur; and (D) the establishment of a right of pledge over the shares of the relevant Dutch members of the Bank Group and the conditional transfer of the voting rights to the pledgee; and (xix) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any Excluded Swap Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

A-160 ----- 2. **Guarantors and Security (a) Each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and each guarantee will be for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of Clause 31 (Guarantee and Indemnity) of this Agreement and the Security Principles set out in paragraph 1 above in each relevant jurisdiction and the requirements of local law in each relevant jurisdiction. (b) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 31 (Guarantee and Indemnity) of this Agreement and this Schedule, all security shall be given in favour of the Security Agent and not the Finance Parties individually. “Parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents unless required under local laws. To the extent possible, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any Lender transfers any of its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender. (c) Security Documents will, to the extent legally possible and subject to this Schedule, incorporate the defined terms used in the Intercreditor Agreement and secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of the relevant Obligor to the secured parties, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, local law requirements and the requirements of this Schedule in each relevant jurisdiction and, in no circumstances, shall impose any obligation more onerous than those contained in this Agreement other than to the extent required by local law in order to create, enforce or perfect the security interest expressed to be created thereby. (d) Where a Security Provider secures shares, the relevant security document will be governed by the laws of the company whose shares are being charged or pledged and not by the law of the country of the Security Provider. (e) No action will be required to be taken in relation to any guarantee or security where any Lender transfers or assigns any of its participation in the Facilities.

Security over banks accounts shall require the relevant Security Provider to use reasonable endeavours to procure that the account bank waives any right of set-off or other interest arising by law or under its general business conditions; (g) no security shall be taken over moveable plant or equipment if it would require any labelling or segregation of that plant or equipment; (h) no security shall be taken over any stock in trade if it would require any item-specific or periodic listing of stock in trade or any segregation thereof; (i) subject to paragraph (j) below, representations and undertakings shall only be included in each security document to the extent they relate to the security interest or secured assets or any registration or perfection of the security unless otherwise required by local law; (j) the provisions of each security document will not be unduly burdensome on the Security Provider (in relation to the benefit conferred) or interfere materially with the operation of its business and will be limited to those required to create effective security and will not impose commercial obligations and shall not contain additional representations and undertakings (such as in respect of insurance, maintenance of assets, information or the payment of costs) or otherwise repeat any such representations or undertakings given in this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, other than those which are strictly required as a matter of law for the creation and perfection of the security; (k) in the security documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in this Agreement (or the Intercreditor Agreement) including, without limitation, those relating to notices, costs and expenses, default or penalty interest, indemnities, tax gross up or indemnity, distribution of proceeds and release of security; representations and undertakings shall be included in the security documents only to the extent that they are strictly required by local law for the creation and perfection of the security interest expressed to be created thereby; the security documents will not contain repeating representations; (l) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent, that they are strictly required by local law to be provided to perfect, enforce or register the security and, when required, shall be provided no more frequently than annually or, following a Declared Default on the Security Agent’s written request; (m) the security documents should not and will not operate so as to prevent transactions which are not prohibited under the other Finance Documents; (n) the secured parties shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of a Declared Default or if the relevant Security Provider has failed to comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation within ten Business Days of being notified of that failure and being requested to comply (provided that in such case, the power of attorney shall be limited to remedying such failure); (o) the Security Agent shall (and is irrevocably authorised and instructed to) promptly enter into and deliver any documentation and/or take such other action as may be required by the Company to give effect to the Security Principles; A-162 ----- (p) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental charges to be delivered in respect of future assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental charges shall be provided at intervals no more frequently than annually, in each case on the Security Agent’s reasonable written request; (q) the terms of any security over intellectual property (including domain names) will not require any registration, protection or perfection of intellectual property or the security granted over it in any jurisdiction other than, in respect of material intellectual property (including domain names), The Netherlands or any other jurisdiction in which the relevant Security Provider is incorporated or carries on business; (r) the pledges over bank accounts and insurances will be subject to a disclosed pledge; and (s) each security document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the security document and this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of this Agreement or (as applicable) the Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the relevant security document. 4. **Share Security (a) Subject to these Security Principles the shares in each Obligor (other than the Company) shall be secured. (b) The security document will be governed by the laws of the Obligor whose shares are being secured and not by the law of the country of the Security Provider granting the security. (c) Until a Declared Default, the Security Providers will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the security or cause an event of default to occur and the person whose shares have been pledged shall be permitted to pay dividends to the relevant Security Provider and the relevant Security Provider shall be entitled to receive dividends from such person. (d) Where customary the share certificate and a stock transfer form executed in blank will be provided to the Security Agent, and where required by law the share certificate or shareholders register will be endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy of the written up register provided to the Security Agent, in each case, within 20 Business Days following execution of any security over those shares or the registration of the acquisition of those shares that are subject to such security. (e) Unless the restriction is required by law (or as expressly contemplated in any security document), the constitutional documents of any company the shares in which are subject to security will be amended to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement of the security granted over them. (f) The enforcement of security over shares and the acquisition or exercise by the Security Agent of voting rights in respect of shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, enforcement of any security over shares and the exercise by the Security Agent of the voting rights in respect of such shares will be expressed to be conditional upon obtaining any consents required by law or regulation and no such consents shall be required to be sought or requested prior to a Declared Default and written request having been made by the Security Agent to the Company. 5. **Receivables (a) If a Security Provider grants security over its intercompany receivables or rights in respect of Subordinated Shareholder Loans it shall be free to deal with same in the course of its business (provided permitted or not prohibited by this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement) until notified by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default. (b) The perfection of receivables security granted by notification will not be required until the occurrence of a Declared Default other than where such notification is required by applicable law to create security. If such notification is required by applicable law to perfect, notice of the security will be served on the relevant counterparties in respect of material intercompany receivables and Subordinated Shareholder Loans within 20 Business Days of the security being granted and the Security Provider shall use its commercially reasonable endeavours (not involving A-163 ----- the payment of money or incurrence of external expenses) to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the Security Provider has used its commercially reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance its obligation to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance shall cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period. (c) Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent the Security Provider from dealing with a receivable in the course of its business (provided permitted or not prohibited by this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement) no notice of security shall be served until required by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default. 6. **Release of Security Unless required by local law, the circumstances in which the security shall be released should not be dealt with in individual security documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
