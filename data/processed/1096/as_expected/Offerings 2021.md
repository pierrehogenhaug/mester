**The Company**

We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing properties,

retail and online sports betting operations, and video gaming terminal (“VGT”) operations. Our wholly-owned
interactive division, Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC (“Penn Interactive”), operates retail sports betting across the
our portfolio, as well as online sports betting, online social casino, bingo and online casinos (“iGaming”). In
February 2020, we acquired 36% (inclusive of 1% on a delayed basis) equity interest in Barstool Sports, Inc.
(“Barstool Sports”), a leading digital sports, entertainment, lifestyle and media company, and entered into a strategic
relationship with Barstool Sports, whereby Barstool Sports will exclusively promote the our land-based retail
sportsbooks, iGaming products and online sports betting products, including the Barstool Sportsbook mobile app, to
its national audience. We launched an online sports betting app called Barstool Sports in Pennsylvania in September
2020, in Michigan in January 2021, in Illinois in March 2021 and in Indiana in May 2021. We also operate iGaming
in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Our MYCHOICE® customer loyalty program currently has over 24 million
members and provides such members with various benefits, including complimentary goods and/or services. Our
strategy has continued to evolve from an owner and manager of gaming and racing properties into an omni-channel
provider of retail and online gaming, live racing and sports betting entertainment. We believe our continued
evolution into a best-in-class omni-channel provider of retail and online gaming and sports betting entertainment
will be a catalyst for our core land-based business, while also providing a platform for significant long-term
shareholder value.

As of March 31, 2021, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in 41 properties in 19 states. The

majority of the real estate assets (i.e., land and buildings) used in our operations are subject to triple net master
leases; the most significant of which are the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease (as such terms are
defined in the section entitled “Offering Memorandum Summary—The Company—Triple Net Leases” and
collectively referred to as the “Master Leases”), with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ: GLPI)
(“GLPI”), a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). In addition, we are currently developing two Category 4 satellite
gaming casinos in Pennsylvania: Hollywood Casino York and Hollywood Casino Morgantown, both of which are
expected to commence operations by the end of 2021.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (known as “COVID
19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic. To help combat the spread of COVID-19 and pursuant to various orders
from state gaming regulatory bodies or governmental authorities, operations at all of our properties were temporarily
suspended for single or multiple time periods during the year. Once re-opened, properties operated with reduced
gaming and hotel capacity and limited food and beverage offerings in order to accommodate social distancing and
health and safety protocols.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, our properties temporarily suspended operations in Pennsylvania,

Michigan and Illinois and were subject to increased operational restrictions in Ohio and Massachusetts (among other
states). Our Michigan property temporarily closed on November 17, 2020 and reopened on December 23, 2020.
Our Pennsylvania properties temporarily closed on December 12, 2020 and reopened on January 4, 2021. Our
Illinois properties temporarily closed on November 20, 2020 and began reopening with limited hours of operations
beginning January 16, 2021 and throughout the week. The property closures were pursuant to the various orders


-----

from state gaming regulatory bodies or governmental authorities to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19. As of
the date of this offering memorandum, with the exception of Valley Race Park, all of our properties have reopened.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to our business and had a material adverse impact

on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During the year, substantial measures were taken to
improve our financial position and liquidity as discussed in our Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1,
“Organization and Basis of Presentation” in the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum.

In February 2020, we closed on our investment in Barstool Sports pursuant to a stock purchase agreement
with Barstool Sports and stockholders of Barstool Sports, in which we purchased approximately 36% of the
common stock of Barstool Sports for a purchase price of $161.2 million. Within three years after the closing or
earlier at our election, we will increase our ownership in Barstool Sports to approximately 50% with an incremental
investment of approximately $62 million, consistent with the implied valuation at the time of the initial investment.
With respect to the remaining Barstool Sports shares, we have immediately exercisable call rights, and the existing
Barstool Sports stockholders have put rights exercisable beginning three years after closing, all based on a fair
market value calculation at the time of exercise (subject to a cap of $650.0 million and a floor of 2.25 times the
annualized revenue of Barstool Sports, all subject to various adjustments). Upon closing, we became Barstool
Sports’ exclusive gaming partner for up to 40 years and have the sole right to utilize the Barstool Sports brand for all
of our online and retail sports betting and iGaming products. For additional information, see Note 7, “Investments
in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates” in the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum.

On December 15, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with GLPI to purchase the operations of
Hollywood Casino Perryville for $31.1 million. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of
2021, however there is no guarantee that this transaction will close within this time frame, or at all. Simultaneous
with the closing of the transaction, we would lease the real estate assets associated with Hollywood Casino
Perryville from GLPI with initial annual rent of $7.8 million per year subject to escalation. For additional
information on our acquisitions, see Note 6, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in the 2020 10-K, which is
incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

In May 2019, we acquired Greektown Casino-Hotel (“Greektown”) in Detroit, Michigan, subject to a triple
net lease with VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE: VICI) (“VICI”, a REIT and collectively with GLPI, our “REIT
Landlords”) (the “Greektown Lease”) and, in January 2019, we acquired Margaritaville Casino Resort
(“Margaritaville”) in Bossier City, Louisiana, subject to a triple net lease with VICI (the “Margaritaville Lease” and
collectively with the Master Leases, the Greektown Lease, the Meadows Lease, the Tropicana Lease and the
Morgantown Lease, of which the Meadows Lease, the Tropicana Lease and Morgantown Lease are defined in the
section entitled “Offering Memorandum Summary—The Company—Triple Net Leases,” the “Triple Net Leases”).

In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (“Pinnacle”), a leading
regional gaming operator (the “Pinnacle Acquisition”). In connection with the Pinnacle Acquisition, we added 12
gaming properties to our portfolio, providing us with greater operational scale and geographic diversity. We
assumed the Pinnacle Master Lease concurrently with the closing of the Pinnacle Acquisition.

We believe that our portfolio of assets provides us the benefit of geographically-diversified cash flow from
operations. We expect to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a
disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and
investments, and the development of new gaming properties. In addition, the partnership with Barstool Sports
reflects our strategy to continue evolving from the nation’s largest regional gaming operator to a best-in-class omnichannel provider of retail and online gaming and sports betting entertainment.

**Triple Net Leases**

As noted above, the majority of the real estate assets used in our operations are subject to either the Penn

Master Lease or the Pinnacle Master Lease. In addition to the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease,
five individual gaming facilities used in our operations are subject to individual triple net leases. Under triple net


-----

leases, in addition to lease payments for the real estate assets, the Company is required to pay the following, among
other things: (1) all facility maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the
business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than
taxes on the income of the lessor); (4) all tenant capital improvements; and (5) all utilities and other services
necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.

The following summaries of the Master Leases are qualified in their entirety by reference to either the Penn

Master Lease or the Pinnacle Master Lease, as applicable, all of which are incorporated by reference in the exhibits
to the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

_Penn Master Lease and Pinnacle Master Lease_

Pursuant to a triple net master lease with GLPI (the “Penn Master Lease”), which became effective

November 1, 2013, we lease real estate assets associated with 19 of the gaming facilities used in our operations. The
Penn Master Lease has an initial term of 15 years with four subsequent, five-year renewal periods on the same terms
and conditions, exercisable at our option. If we elect to renew the term of the Penn Master Lease, the renewal will
be effective as to all of the leased real estate assets then subject to the Penn Master Lease, subject to limitations on
the final renewal term with respect to certain of the barge-based facilities.

In connection with the Pinnacle Acquisition, we assumed a triple net master lease with GLPI (the “Pinnacle

Master Lease”), originally effective April 28, 2016. Pursuant to the Pinnacle Master Lease, we lease real estate
assets associated with 12 of the gaming facilities used in our operations from GLPI. Upon assumption of the
Pinnacle Master Lease, as amended, there were 7.5 years remaining of the initial ten-year term, with five
subsequent, five-year renewal periods exercisable at our option. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Pinnacle
Acquisition, GLPI acquired the real estate assets associated with Plainridge Park Casino and leased back such assets
to us pursuant to an amendment to the Pinnacle Master Lease.

Pursuant to a binding term sheet between the Company and GLPI entered into on March 27, 2020, we

agreed that, in the future, we would exercise the next scheduled five-year renewal under the Penn Master Lease and
the Pinnacle Master Lease. GLPI agreed they would grant us the option to exercise an additional five-year renewal
term at the end of the lease term on the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease, subject to certain

On October 1, 2020, we sold the land underlying our Morgantown development project to GLPI in

exchange for rent credits of $30.0 million. Contemporaneous with the sale, we entered into a triple net lease with a
subsidiary of GLPI for the land underlying Morgantown (the “Morgantown Lease”). The initial term of the
Morgantown Lease is twenty years with six subsequent, five-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option.

_Meadows Lease, Margaritaville Lease, Greektown Lease and Tropicana Lease_

In connection with the Pinnacle Acquisition, we assumed a triple net lease of the real estate assets used in

the operations of Meadows Racetrack and Casino (the “Meadows Lease”), originally effective September 9, 2016,
with GLPI as the landlord. Upon assumption of the Meadows Lease, there were eight years remaining of the initial
ten-year term, with three subsequent, five-year renewal options followed by one four-year renewal option on the
same terms and conditions, exercisable at our option.

As discussed above, in separate acquisitions, we entered into the Margaritaville Lease with VICI for the

real estate assets used in the operations of Margaritaville and the Greektown Lease with VICI for the real estate
assets used in the operations of Greektown. Both the Margaritaville Lease and the Greektown Lease have initial


-----

terms of 15 years, with four subsequent five-year renewal options on the same terms and conditions, exercisable at
our option.

On April 16, 2020, we sold the real estate assets associated with our Tropicana Las Vegas (“Tropicana”)

property to a subsidiary of GLPI in exchange for rent credits of $307.5 million. Contemporaneous with the sale, we
entered into a leaseback of the real estate assets for nominal cash rent. We are required to continue to operate the
Tropicana for two years (subject to three one-year extensions at GLPI’s option) or until the real estate assets and the
operations of the Tropicana are earlier sold by GLPI.

On April 13, 2021, GLPI announced that it entered into a binding term sheet with Bally’s Corporation
(“Bally’s”) whereby Bally’s plans to acquire both GLPI’s non-land real estate assets and our outstanding equity
interests in Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Inc., which has the gaming license and operates the Tropicana,
for an aggregate cash acquisition price of $150.0 million. GLPI will retain ownership of the land and will
concurrently enter into a 50-year ground lease with initial annual rent of $10.5 million. This transaction is expected
to close in early 2022, subject to the Company, GLPI and Bally’s entering into definitive agreements and regulatory
approval. There is no guarantee that this transaction will close within this time frame, or at all

**Recent Developments**

We currently expect that our consolidated revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2021 will range
from $1,450 million to $1,555 million and our consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR for the three months ended June
30, 2021 will range from $540 million to $580 million. We expect Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended
June 30, 2021 to range from $420 million to $460 million. The midpoint of our expected revenue and Adjusted
EBITDAR ranges reflect a quarterly sequential improvement of 18% and 25%, respectively, and Adjusted
EBITDAR margin improvement of 220 basis points. When compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019, we
expect revenue, Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR margin to increase by 10%, 32%, and 625 basis
points, respectively. We believe this year-over-year and sequential improvement not only highlights continued
strong demand trends, but also underscores our ability to drive sustainable margin improvement.

These expected results are preliminary, are subject to results through the end of the quarter and quarter-end
financial adjustments. We are not able to reconcile expected Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR to net
income (loss) due to such adjustments and calculations relating to taxes, stock compensation and other matters that
are not available at this time. These expected results should not be viewed as a substitute for our financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these


-----

projections. For important information regarding the foregoing preliminary expectations set forth above, See “NonGAAP Financial Measures,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

(1) For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment losses primarily related to impairments taken on our goodwill and other
intangible assets of $113.0 million and $498.5 million, respectively, as a result of an interim impairment assessment during the first quarter
of 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, we identified an indicator of impairment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused all
of our gaming properties to temporarily close. At the time of the interim impairment assessment, we revised our cash flow projections to
reflect the current economic environment, including the uncertainty of the nature, timing and extent of reopening our gaming properties.
Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million resulting from an impairment analysis of the long-lived assets at the
Tropicana Las Vegas and an impairment charge of $4.6 million on our investment in the Texas joint ventures with MAXXAM.

(2) Includes the full year impact of the Pinnacle Acquisition and the acquisitions of Margaritaville in January 2019 and Greektown in May
2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment losses on our goodwill and other intangible assets of $170.6
million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense associated with the Penn Master Lease decreased by $181.2 million as
a result of the adoption of ASC 842 (as defined in footnote (5) below), interest expense associated with the Pinnacle Master Lease increased
by $126.0 million, and interest expense incurred on long-term debt increased by $50.8 million.

(3) Includes the impact of the acquisition of Pinnacle in October 2018. In addition, we incurred $95.0 million in costs, primarily associated with
the Pinnacle Acquisition, a $21.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, and a $34.3 million long-lived asset impairment charge.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $63.0 million of interest expense associated with the Pinnacle Master Lease.

(4) In addition to GAAP financial measures, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR margin as
non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial
results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is not calculated in


-----

the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure of comparing performance among different
companies.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based
compensation; debt extinguishment and financing charges; impairment losses; insurance recoveries, net of deductible charges; changes in
the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations; gain or loss on disposal of assets; the difference between budget and
actual expense for cash-settled stock-based awards; pre-opening and acquisition costs; and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is
inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with our share of non-operating items (such as interest expense, net; income
taxes; depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation expense) added back for Barstool Sports and our Kansas Entertainment
joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA is inclusive of rent expense associated with our triple net operating leases (the operating lease components
contained within the Penn Master Lease and Pinnacle Master Lease (primarily land), the Meadows Lease, the Margaritaville Lease, the
Greektown Lease and the Tropicana Lease). Although Adjusted EBITDA includes rent expense associated with our triple net operating
leases, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our consolidated results of
operations.

Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our
business, and is especially relevant in evaluating large, long-lived casino-hotel projects because it provides a perspective on the current
effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. We
present Adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors and creditors as an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing
business operations, including our ability to service debt, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and operations. These calculations
are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value
companies within our industry. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including
us, have historically excluded from their Adjusted EBITDA calculations of certain corporate expenses that do not relate to the management
of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with
GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented as a supplemental disclosure, as management believes that it is a commonly used
measure of performance in the gaming industry and that it is considered by many to be a key indicator of the Company’s operating results.

We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) plus rent expense associated with triple net operating leases (which
is a normal, recurring cash operating expense necessary to operate our business). Adjusted EBITDAR is presented on a consolidated basis
outside the financial statements solely as a valuation metric. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR is an additional metric
traditionally used by analysts in valuing gaming companies subject to triple net leases since it eliminates the effects of variability in leasing
methods and capital structures. This metric is included as supplemental disclosure because (i) we believe Adjusted EBITDAR is
traditionally used by gaming operator analysts and investors to determine the equity value of gaming operators and (ii) Adjusted EBITDAR
is one of the metrics used by other financial analysts in valuing our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDAR is useful for equity valuation
purposes because (i) its calculation isolates the effects of financing real estate; and (ii) using a multiple of Adjusted EBITDAR to calculate
enterprise value allows for an adjustment to the balance sheet to recognize estimated liabilities arising from operating leases related to real
estate. However, Adjusted EBITDAR when presented on a consolidated basis, is not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP and
should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance or considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because it
excludes the rent expense associated with our triple net operating leases and is provided for the limited purposes referenced herein.
Adjusted EBITDAR margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDAR on a consolidated basis (as defined above) divided by revenues on a
consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDAR margin is presented on a consolidated basis outside the financial statements solely as a valuation
metric.

(5) On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”), using a modified retrospective approach, which did not
require that prior years presented be restated. Upon adoption of ASC 842, among other items, we reduced property and equipment, net, by
$1,571.7 million, recorded right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $4,030.8 million, reduced the financing obligations by
$2,954.1 million, and a recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of $1,085.7 million.

(6) Total debt represents the sum of total long-term debt (net of current maturities and debt issuance costs) plus current maturities of long-term
debt.

GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

variances to budget on cash-settled stock-based awards. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the price of the Company’s common
stock increased significantly, which resulted in unfavorable variances to budget.

**RISK FACTORS**

You should carefully consider the following risks and all the other information contained in, and
incorporated by reference in, this offering memorandum, including the additional risk factors set forth beginning on
page 10 of the 2020 10-K, before investing in the notes. The risks described below and in the 2020 10-K are not the
only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be
immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any
of the following risks and the risks described in the 2020 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or a part of your original investment.

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our_**
**_obligations under our outstanding indebtedness._**

As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to the issuance of the notes, PNG and its
subsidiaries would have had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $2,768.6 million, including $400.0
million representing the notes offered hereby and approximately $1,612.0 million of secured indebtedness
outstanding under the Credit Agreement (excluding amounts under outstanding letters of credit) and an additional
$672.0 million of borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. In addition, we are required to make significant
annual lease payments to our REIT Landlords pursuant to the Triple Net Leases, which we currently expect will be
approximately $839.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2021.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and significant fixed annual lease payments under the Triple
Net Leases. Our substantial indebtedness and additional fixed costs under our Lease obligations could have
important consequences to our financial health.

As noted above, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our gaming properties had been temporarily closed. The
closure of our gaming properties had significantly disrupted our ability to generate revenues. In order to remain in
compliance with PNG’s debt covenants and meet PNG’s payment obligations, on April 14, 2020, PNG and certain
of its subsidiaries entered into an agreement to amend PNG’s existing credit agreement to provide temporary relief
from PNG’s financial covenants. In addition, our substantial indebtedness could result in an event of default if we
fail to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive
covenants contained in our debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming
immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such
debt.

**_The availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on business._**

We intend to finance some of our current and future expansion, development and renovation projects and
acquisitions with cash flow from operations, borrowings under the Secured Credit Facilities and equity or debt
financings. If we are unable to finance our current or future projects, we could have to seek alternative financing.
Depending on credit market conditions, alternative sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion,
development and/or renovation, or such other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely
manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion,
development and renovation projects and acquisitions, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows.

The borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement is $672.0 million. There is no certainty that our
lenders will continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under the Secured Credit Facilities.

-21

-----

**_The alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs._**

The interest rates of PNG’s senior secured credit facilities under the Credit Agreement (the “Secured Credit
Facilities”) are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, which may be subject to regulatory guidance
and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than
in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority (the ‘‘FCA’’), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or
compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). In March 2021,
the FCA announced that the majority of LIBOR settings would cease after December 31, 2021, and the remaining
LIBOR settings would cease after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened
by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed, has identified the Secured Oversight Financing Rate (SOFR)
as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for USD LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect
any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such
as SOFR, or any other reference rate, will have on us or PNG’s revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement
(the “Revolving Credit Facility”). However, if LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR
change from their current form, our borrowing costs may be adversely affected.

**_To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond_**
**_our control._**

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us under the Secured Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our
liquidity needs, including with respect to our indebtedness. We also may incur indebtedness related to properties we
develop or acquire in the future prior to generating cash flow from those properties. If those properties do not
provide us with cash flow to service that indebtedness (including as a result of COVID-19), we will need to rely on
cash flow from our other properties, which would increase our leverage. In addition, if we consummate significant
acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly.

**Risks Related to this Offering and the Notes**

**_The notes are unsecured. Therefore, PNG’s secured creditors (including the lenders under the Secured Credit_**
**_Facilities) would have a prior claim, ahead of the notes, on PNG’s assets._**

The notes are unsecured. As a result, upon any distribution to PNG’s creditors in a bankruptcy, liquidation
or reorganization or similar proceeding relating to PNG or its property, the holders of PNG’s secured debt, including
the lenders under the Secured Credit Facilities, will be entitled to be paid in full from our assets securing that
secured debt before any payment may be made with respect to the notes. As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted
basis, after giving effect to the issuance of the notes, PNG would have had approximately $1,612.0 million of
secured Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement (excluding amounts under undrawn outstanding
letters of credit) and an additional $672.0 million of borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. In addition, if
PNG fails to meet its payment or other obligations under PNG’s secured debt, the holders of that secured debt would
be entitled to foreclose on PNG’s assets securing that secured debt and liquidate those assets. Accordingly, PNG
may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result you may lose a portion of or the entire
value of your investment in the notes.

**_PNG is a holding company and the notes are not guaranteed by any of PNG’s subsidiaries. As a result, the_**
**_creditors of PNG’s subsidiaries have a prior claim, ahead of the notes, on all of PNG’s subsidiaries’ assets._**

PNG has no direct operations and no significant assets other than ownership of the stock of PNG’s
subsidiaries. Because PNG conducts its operations through PNG’s subsidiaries, PNG depends on those entities for
dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet PNG’s financial obligations, including
payments of principal and interest on the notes.

Since none of PNG’s subsidiaries will guarantee the notes offered hereby, creditors of PNG’s subsidiaries
(including lenders under our the Secured Credit Facilities in the case of subsidiaries that are guarantors of the

-22

-----

Secured Credit Facilities) have a prior claim, ahead of the holders of the notes, on the assets of those subsidiaries.
As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, PNG’s subsidiaries would have had total indebtedness (including
guarantees under the Credit Agreement) of approximately $1,612.0 million. The liabilities of PNG’s subsidiaries
also include payables, deferred taxes, intercompany debt and other ordinary course liabilities. In addition, PNG’s
subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make any funds
available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up of any of PNG’s subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness
and trade creditors of PNG’s subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of
PNG’s subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to PNG. Accordingly, there may be
insufficient funds to satisfy claims of noteholders.

Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing current and future indebtedness of PNG’s
subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may further limit our
ability to obtain cash from PNG’s subsidiaries. In addition, the earnings of PNG’s subsidiaries, covenants contained
in PNG’s and PNG’s subsidiaries’ debt agreements (including the Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes Indenture
(as defined in the Description of Notes) and the indenture), covenants contained in other agreements to which PNG
or PNG’s subsidiaries are or may become subject, business and tax considerations, and applicable law, including
laws regarding the payment of dividends and distributions, may further restrict the ability of PNG’s subsidiaries to
make distributions to PNG. PNG cannot assure you that PNG’s subsidiaries will be able to provide PNG with
sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund the interest and principal payments on the notes when due.

**_PNG’s debt agreements give us flexibility to undertake certain transactions which could be adverse to the_**
**_interests of holders of the notes, including making restricted payments and incurring additional indebtedness_**
**_ranking pari passu with the notes, including secured indebtedness._**

Notwithstanding the restrictive covenants described above in PNG’s debt agreements, the terms of the
indenture will give PNG flexibility to undertake certain transactions which could be adverse to the interests of
holders of the notes.

For example, the provisions contained or to be contained in the agreements relating to PNG’s indebtedness,
including the notes offered hereby, limit but do not prohibit PNG’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional
indebtedness senior to or pari passu with the notes, and the amount of indebtedness that PNG and its subsidiaries
could incur could be substantial and could be used to finance acquisitions or to assume debt in connection with an
acquisition. Accordingly, PNG or its subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future,
including additional indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and additional senior notes. Much of this
additional indebtedness could constitute secured or senior indebtedness. In addition, any of PNG’s or its
subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness could be guaranteed in the future by PNG’s subsidiaries or could be further
secured. If PNG incurs any secured indebtedness, the holders of that secured indebtedness will be entitled to be paid
in full from the assets securing that indebtedness before any payment may be made with respect to the notes. If
PNG incurs any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes offered hereby, the holders of that
indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of these notes in any proceeds distributed in
connection with any bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceedings. This may have the effect of
reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If new indebtedness is added to PNG’s current debt levels, the related
risks that PNG now faces, including those described above, could intensify. See “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.”

**_PNG may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer required by the_**
**_indenture or the terms of PNG’s other indebtedness. In addition, under certain circumstances, PNG may be_**
**_permitted to use the proceeds from debt to effect merger payments in compliance with the indenture._**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each Holder of notes will have the right to require PNG to
repurchase all or any part of that Holder’s notes pursuant to an offer by PNG on the terms set forth in the indenture
at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the notes repurchased, to, but not including, the date of purchase. If a Change of Control
Triggering Event were to occur, PNG cannot assure you that it would have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price
for all the notes tendered by the holders or such other indebtedness. In addition, under the indenture, if PNG

-23

-----

satisfies certain leverage and/or ratings criteria, PNG is permitted to engage in a merger constituting or resulting in a
Change of Control (as defined in the Description of Notes) and to use the proceeds of indebtedness that we may
incur under the indenture to make payments that would otherwise constitute a restricted payment. Such events will
permit PNG to increase its leverage for purposes of paying or guaranteeing indebtedness used to finance merger
consideration for our equity holders, which might not otherwise be permitted under the indenture. See “Description
of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Restricted
Payments.”

The Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes Indenture contain, and the indenture will contain and
any future agreements relating to indebtedness to which PNG becomes a party may contain, provisions restricting
PNG’s ability to purchase notes or providing that an occurrence of a change of control constitutes an event of
default, or otherwise requiring payment of amounts borrowed under those agreements. If a Change of Control
Triggering Event occurs at a time when PNG is prohibited from purchasing the notes, PNG could seek the consent
of PNG’s then existing lenders and other creditors to the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the
indebtedness that contains the prohibition. If PNG does not obtain such a consent or repay such indebtedness, PNG
would remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In that case, PNG’s failure to purchase tendered notes would
constitute a default under the terms of the indenture governing the notes and any other indebtedness that we may
enter into from time to time with similar provisions.

**_You may be required to sell your notes if any gaming authority finds you unsuitable to hold them or otherwise_**
**_requires PNG to redeem or repurchase the notes from you._**

In the event that any of the applicable regulatory agencies or authorities require you, as a holder of the
notes, to be licensed, qualified or found suitable under applicable gaming or racing laws, and you fail to do so, if
required, PNG will have the right, at PNG’s option, to redeem or repurchase your notes. There can be no assurance
that PNG will have sufficient funds or otherwise will be able to repurchase any or all of your notes. See
“Description of Notes—Redemption—Gaming Redemption.”

**_Purchasers of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_notes under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer_**
**_or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from, or in transactions not subject to,
registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and PNG does not currently intend to
register the notes under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. Purchasers of the notes will not be
entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in
the United States only in a transaction registered under, exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_Illiquidity and an absence of a public market for the notes could cause purchasers of the notes to be unable to_**
**_resell the notes._**

The notes constitute a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. PNG does
not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the notes on any automated
dealer quotation system. An active trading market for the notes may not develop or, if such market develops, it
could be very illiquid. PNG has been informed by certain of the initial purchasers that they intend to make a market
in the notes after the offering is completed. The initial purchasers may cease their market-making at any time
without notice.

Holders of the notes may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, the notes. If no active
trading market develops, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected, and you may not be
able to resell your notes at their fair market value, at the initial offering price or at all. If a market for the notes
develops, any such market may be discontinued at any time. If a trading market develops for the notes, future
trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our

-24

-----

operating results, liquidity of the issue, the market for similar securities and other factors, including our financial
condition and prospects and the financial condition and prospects for companies in our industry.

**_Changes in PNG’s credit rating could adversely affect the market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including PNG.
The credit rating agencies also evaluate PNG’s industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for PNG
based on their overall view of PNG’s industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their
ratings on the notes. A negative change in our ratings could have an adverse effect on the price of the notes.

**_If on any future date the notes are rated investment grade by certain rating agencies, certain of the restrictive_**
**_covenants contained in the indenture will be terminated._**

If the notes are rated investment grade by certain rating agencies and at such time no event of default under
the indenture has occurred and is continuing, certain of the covenants in the indenture will terminate and will not go
back into effect at any time. These covenants restrict, among other things, PNG’s ability to make restricted
payments, incur indebtedness, pay dividends and to enter into certain other transaction as well as obligate us to offer
to repurchase the notes following certain asset sales. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated
investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain such ratings. However,
termination of these covenants would allow PNG to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while
these covenants were in force. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds of the sale of the notes are estimated to be approximately $393.3 million. We intend to
use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this section under the subheading “—Certain
Definitions.” In this description, “Penn National,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers only to Penn National Gaming, Inc.
and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

Penn National will issue the % senior notes due 2029 under an indenture (the “indenture”) between
itself and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors” elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
We will not be required to, nor do we currently intend to, register the notes for resale under the Securities Act or
offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the indenture is not, and will
not be, qualified under, subject to, or incorporate, restate or make reference to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as may be amended (the “TIA”) other than expressly as set forth therein, and the provisions of the TIA
that would otherwise be made part of the indenture are not, and will not be, included in the indenture.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the
indenture in its entirety. We urge you to read the indenture because the indenture, and not this description, defines
your rights as Holders of the notes. Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under the
caption “—Certain Definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the indenture.

The registered Holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The notes:

    - will be unsubordinated, unsecured obligations of Penn National;

    - will rank equally in right of payment with all unsubordinated Indebtedness of Penn National, without
giving effect to collateral arrangements;

    - will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all secured Indebtedness of Penn National,
including Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such Indebtedness;

    - will be senior in right of payment to all subordinated Indebtedness of Penn National; and

    - will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any Subsidiary of Penn National.

As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to the issuance of the notes, Penn
National and its Subsidiaries would have had total consolidated Indebtedness of approximately $2,768.6 million,
including $400.0 million representing the notes offered hereunder and approximately $1,612.0 million of secured
Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement (excluding amounts under outstanding letters of credit) and an
additional $672.0 million of borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. In addition, as of March 31, 2021, on
an as adjusted basis, Penn National’s Subsidiaries would have had total Indebtedness (including guarantees under
the Credit Agreement) of approximately $1,612.0 million. The indenture will permit Penn National and its
Subsidiaries to incur substantial additional Indebtedness, including secured Indebtedness.

As of the date of the indenture, all of Penn National’s Subsidiaries other than the Existing Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under the circumstances described below under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” we will be permitted to designate
certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Penn National’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture.

-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

Subject to Penn National’s compliance with the covenant described below under the caption “Certain
Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” Penn National may issue notes under the
indenture in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, of which $400.0 million principal amount is being issued in
this offering. Penn National will issue notes minimum in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof. The notes will mature on, 2029. The notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes
will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the indenture. Any Additional Notes will be substantially
identical in all respects to the notes offered in this offering, except that Additional Notes may have different issuance
prices, will have different issuance dates, may have different first interest payment dates, may have different CUSIP
numbers and may have transaction specific redemption or repurchase provisions. If the Additional Notes are not
fungible with or treated as the same issue as the notes offered in this offering for United States federal income tax
purposes, they will have a separate CUSIP number, if applicable. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all
purposes of the indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to the notes include any Additional Notes
actually issued.

Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on and         , commencing on, 20 . Penn National will make each interest
payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding and . If any interest
payment date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment will be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue in respect of the delay.

Interest on the notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it
was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Payments on notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent and registrar within continental
United States unless Penn National elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the Holders at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar. Penn National may change the paying agent or
registrar without prior notice to the Holders of the notes, and Penn National or any of its Subsidiaries may act as
paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. The registrar and the trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of
notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. Penn National is not required to transfer or
exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, Penn National is not required to transfer or exchange any note for
a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption.

**Redemption**

_Optional Redemption_

_Optional Redemption Prior To_ _, 2024_

At any time prior to      , 2024, Penn National may redeem the notes for cash at its option, in whole or
in part, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal
amount of the notes being redeemed and (2) the present value at such redemption date of (x) the redemption price of

-29

-----

the note at, 2024 (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing below under the caption “—
Optional Redemption On and After, 2024”) plus (y) all required interest payments due on the note through
, 2024 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date), computed using a
discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points, plus in either case accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record of
notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

“Treasury Rate” means, as of the date of any redemption notice, the weekly average rounded to the nearest
1/100th of a percentage point (for the most recently completed week for which such information is available as of
the date that is two Business Days prior to the date of such redemption notice) of the yield to maturity of United
States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in Federal Reserve Statistical Release
H.15 with respect to each applicable day during such week or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published or
the relevant information does not appear thereon, any publicly available source of similar market data) most nearly
equal to the period from the date of such redemption notice to, 2024; provided, however, that if the period
from the date of such redemption notice to, 2024 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States
Treasury security for which such a yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation
(calculated to the nearest one twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities
for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the Redemption Date to, 2024 is less than
one year, the weekly average yield on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant
maturity of one year shall be used. Any such Treasury Rate shall be determined, and the information required to be
obtained for its calculation shall be obtained, by Penn National.

_Optional Redemption with Proceeds of Equity Offerings_

At any time prior to, 2024, Penn National may redeem the notes for cash at its option, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price of % of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the notes redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date),
with an amount of cash equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued under the indenture remains
outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding notes held by Penn
National and its Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

_Optional Redemption On and After_ _, 2024_

Except as described above, the notes will not be redeemable at Penn National’s option prior to, 2024.
On and after, 2024, Penn National may redeem the notes for cash at its option, in whole or in part, at any time
or from time to time, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes redeemed, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of holders of record of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of the years indicated
below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2024 ................................................................................ %

_Gaming Redemption_

In addition to the foregoing, if any Gaming Authority requires that a Holder or Beneficial Owner of notes
must be licensed, qualified or found suitable under any applicable Gaming Laws and such Holder or Beneficial
Owner:

(1) fails to apply for a license, qualification or a finding of suitability within 30 days (or such shorter
period as may be required by the applicable Gaming Authority) after being requested to do so by the
Gaming Authority, or

(2) is denied such license or qualification or not found suitable, or if any Gaming Authority otherwise
requires that notes from any Holder or Beneficial Owner be redeemed, subject to applicable Gaming
Laws,

in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), Penn National shall have the right, at its option:

(i) to require any such Holder or Beneficial Owner to dispose of its notes within 30 days (or such
earlier date as may be required by the applicable Gaming Authority) of receipt of such notice or
finding by such Gaming Authority (in which event Penn National’s obligation to pay any
interest after the receipt of such notice shall be limited as provided in such Gaming Laws), or

(ii) to call for the redemption of the notes of such Holder or Beneficial Owner at a redemption price
equal to the least of:

(A) the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
earlier of the date of redemption or the date of the denial of license or qualification or of
the finding of unsuitability by such Gaming Authority,

(B) the price at which such Holder or Beneficial Owner acquired the notes, together with
accrued interest to the earlier of the date of redemption or the date of the denial of license
or qualification or of the finding of unsuitability by such Gaming Authority,

(C) such other lesser amount as may be required by any Gaming Authority, or

(D) the lowest closing sale price of the notes on any trading day during the 120-day period
ending on the date upon which Penn National shall have received notice from a Gaming
Authority of such Holder’s disqualification.

Penn National shall notify the trustee in writing of any such redemption as soon as practicable. The Holder
or Beneficial Owner applying for license, qualification or a finding of suitability must pay all costs of the licensure
or investigation for such qualification or finding of suitability and Penn National is not required to pay or reimburse
any Holder or Beneficial Owner of a note for the cost of licensure, qualification or finding of suitability or
investigation for such licensure, qualification or finding of suitability.

_No Mandatory Redemption_

Penn National is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
notes.

_Selection and Notice_

If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee will select notes for redemption as
follows:

-31

-----

(1) if the notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the
principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed; or

(2) if the notes are not listed on any national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such
method as the trustee deems fair and appropriate and in accordance with DTC procedures; provided
that any redemption pursuant to “Optional Redemption with Proceeds of Equity Offerings” shall be
effected on a pro rata basis or on as nearly a pro rata basis as is practicable (subject to DTC
procedures) unless such method is otherwise prohibited or is not practicable.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class
mail (or in the case of global notes, given pursuant to applicable DTC procedures) at least 10 but not more than 60
days before the redemption date to each Holder of notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that (a)
redemption notices may be mailed or given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the notes (whether by covenant or legal defeasance) or a satisfaction and discharge
of the indenture, (b) redemption notices may be mailed or given less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if so required by any applicable Gaming Authority in connection with a redemption described
above under the caption “—Gaming Redemption.” In connection with any redemption of notes (including with the
net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering), any such redemption may, at Penn National’s discretion, be subject to one
or more conditions precedent, including any related Equity Offering or any other transactions. In addition, if such
redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in
Penn National’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied (or waived by Penn National in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Penn National in
its sole discretion) by the redemption date (whether the original redemption date or the redemption date so delayed).
In addition, Penn National may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of
Penn National’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that note that is to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued (or, in the case of global notes, a book-entry position made)
in the name of the Holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note. Notes called for redemption become due
on the date fixed for redemption (subject to satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent). Unless we default
in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

Subject to applicable securities laws, Penn National or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time
acquire notes or other Indebtedness. Any such acquisition may be made through open market or privately
negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon
such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as Penn National or any such affiliates may
determine.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

_Change of Control and Rating Decline_

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each Holder of notes will have the right to require Penn
National to repurchase all or any part (equal to a minimum denomination of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof) of that Holder’s notes pursuant to an offer by Penn National (a “Change of Control Offer”) on the
terms set forth in the indenture, except to the extent Penn National has previously elected to redeem notes as
described under “—Redemption—Optional Redemption” and except as set forth in the fourth succeeding paragraph
below. In the Change of Control Offer, Penn National will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record of notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days
following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, Penn National will mail (or in the case of global
notes, give pursuant to applicable DTC procedures) a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions

-32

-----

that constitute, or are expected to constitute, the Change of Control Triggering Event, and offering to repurchase
notes on the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than
15 days and no later than 60 days after the date such notice is mailed (or in the case of global notes, given pursuant
to applicable DTC procedures), pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice.
Except with respect to the last sentence of the fourth succeeding paragraph, Penn National will comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a
Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, Penn National will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, Penn National will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent no later than 11:00 a.m. New York City time an amount equal to the
Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes accepted for payment; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee (if not previously delivered by the holders of the notes
or otherwise) the notes accepted for payment together with an officer’s certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by Penn National.

The paying agent will promptly pay to each Holder of notes accepted for payment the Change of Control
Payment for such notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book
entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if
any; provided that each new note will be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof.

Penn National will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by Penn National and purchases all notes properly tendered and not validly withdrawn under the Change of
Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of an anticipated Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event.
If such a conditional Change of Control Offer is made, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in
Penn National’s sole discretion, until such time as such Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, or
if such Change of Control Triggering Event shall not have occurred by the applicable Change of Control Payment
Date (whether the original Change of Control Payment Date or the Change of Control Payment Date so delayed) or
if in Penn National’s discretion if in its good faith judgement any or all of the conditions will not be satisfied, then
such Change of Control Offer may be rescinded by Penn National.

Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in any tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or
Change of Control Offer and Penn National, or any third party making such tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or Change
of Control Offer in lieu of Penn National, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders, Penn National or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or
Change of Control Offer, to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash
equal to the price offered to Holders in such tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Penn National and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially
all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a

-33

-----

Holder of notes to require Penn National to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of less than all of the assets of Penn National and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole may be uncertain.

The Credit Agreement and the Master Lease each provide, that certain change of control events with
respect to Penn National would constitute a default under the Credit Agreement or the Master Lease, respectively.
Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which Penn National becomes a party may contain similar
provisions.

In the event a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs at a time when Penn National is prohibited from
purchasing notes by the terms of existing agreements, including Indebtedness, Penn National could seek the consent
of its lenders or other counterparties to the purchase of notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings, as
applicable, that contain such prohibition. If Penn National does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings,
as applicable, Penn National will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In such case, Penn National’s failure to
purchase tendered notes would constitute a default under the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default
under such other Indebtedness.

_Asset Sales_

Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
unless:

(1) Penn National (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity
Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received in the Asset Sale by Penn National
or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of (x) cash or Cash Equivalents or (y) Permitted Business
Assets; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (2), each of the following will be deemed
to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on Penn National’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet (or in the notes thereto), of Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than
liabilities of Penn National that are by their terms subordinated to the notes) that are assumed by
the transferee of any such assets (including in the case of a sale of a Subsidiary, Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary so long as Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not guarantors of or
co-obligors on such Indebtedness following such Asset Sale);

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by Penn National or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that within 270 days after the consummation of such Asset Sale,
subject to ordinary settlement periods, are converted by Penn National or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received
in that conversion; and

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Penn National or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at the time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $250.0 million and 25% of Consolidated Cash Flow for
the Applicable Measurement Period at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash
Consideration, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Penn National or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries may apply an amount equal to those Net Proceeds at its option:

-34

-----

(1) to repay Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (or other Indebtedness of Penn National secured by
a Lien) or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) (x) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase notes, including (I) as provided under “—Optional
Redemption,” (II) by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Note
Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of such purchase or
(III) through open market purchases; or (y) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Indebtedness that
ranks equally in right of payment with the notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”) at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to but not including the date of such prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase;
_provided further that, to the extent Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary redeems, repays or_
repurchases Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (y), Penn National shall equally and
ratably reduce (or offer to reduce) obligations under the notes as provided in the immediately
preceding clause (x);

(3) to improve real property or make capital expenditures;

(4) to invest in or acquire Permitted Business Assets;

(5) to enter into binding commitment to take any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses
(1) through (4), and take such action within 12 months after the end of such 450 day period; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (5).

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, Penn National may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest or utilize the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph
will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds in any fiscal year exceeds $150
million, Penn National will make either the offers set forth in clause (a) or the offer set forth in clause (b), the choice
of offer to be determined by Penn National in its sole discretion:

(a) Penn National will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of notes (the “Note Asset
_Sale Offer”), and an offer to all holders of any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (the “Pari Passu_
_Asset Sale Offer”) containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect_
to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets (to the extent required
pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), to purchase, on a pro rata basis (with
Excess Proceeds prorated between the Holders of notes and such holders of Pari Passu
Indebtedness based upon the respective outstanding aggregate principal amounts (or accreted
value, as applicable) on the date the Note Asset Sale Offer and the Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer,
respectively, are made), the maximum principal amount of the notes and the maximum principal
amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be
purchased out of the respective pro rata amounts of Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the
aggregate principal amount of notes or the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if
applicable) of such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into the Note Asset Sale Offer and the
Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, is less than the principal amount of notes or the
principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Pari Passu Indebtedness offered to be
purchased in the Note Asset Sale Offer or the Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, Penn
National and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use those remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture.

(b) Penn National will make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders of notes and all holders of other Pari
_Passu Indebtedness containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect_
to offers to purchase or redeem or repay with the proceeds of sales of assets (to the extent

-35

-----

required pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to purchase the maximum
principal amount of notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of such Asset Sale
Offer, Penn National may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited
by the indenture.

If, in the case of clause (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of notes or the aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Note Asset Sale Offer
or Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, exceeds the respective pro rata amounts of Excess Proceeds, or, in the
case of clause (b), the aggregate principal amount of notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such
Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes to be repurchased shall be selected in compliance
with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed or, if the
notes are not listed but are in global form, then by lot or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or, if
the notes are not listed and not in global form on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the trustee will
deem to be fair and appropriate, and Penn National shall select Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro
_rata basis on the basis of the aggregate accreted value or principal amount of tendered notes and Pari Passu_
Indebtedness.

The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the “Asset Sale Payment Date”), and will be payable in cash. After the
completion of any Asset Sale, Penn National may make an Asset Sale Offer prior to the time it is required to do so
hereunder. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds in any fiscal year will be
reset at zero.

If any non-cash consideration received by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, in connection with any Asset Sale is converted into or sold or otherwise disposed of for cash (other than
interest received with respect to any such non-cash consideration), then such conversion or disposition, at the time of
such conversion or disposition, shall be subject to the provisions of this covenant (subject to the proviso of the
definition of “Asset Sale”).

Penn National will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, Penn National will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict.

The Credit Agreement contains restrictions on Penn National’s ability to purchase notes with Asset Sale
proceeds. Any future credit agreements or other agreements may contain similar restrictions. In the event an Asset
Sale occurs at a time when Penn National is prohibited from purchasing notes, Penn National could seek the consent
of its lenders to the purchase of notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
Penn National does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, Penn National will remain prohibited from
purchasing notes. In such case, Penn National’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute a default under
the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the indenture.

If on any date following the Issue Date: (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both of the
Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture, then
beginning on that date and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent changes in the ratings of
the notes or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, Penn National and its Subsidiaries will not be subject
to the following provisions of the indenture (collectively, the “Terminated Covenants” and, such event, the
“Covenant Termination Event”):

-36

-----

(a) “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments”;

(b) “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(c) “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(d) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
Assets”;

(e) “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(f) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Upon and following a Covenant Termination Event, no Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind
will be deemed to have occurred or exist under the indenture or the notes with respect to the Terminated Covenants
based on, and none of Penn National or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or failed
to be taken, or any events occurring, upon and following a Covenant Termination Event, regardless of whether such
actions, failure to act or event would have been permitted if the applicable Terminated Covenants remained in effect.

There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain any Investment Grade Rating.

_Certain Determinations_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions
entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of any covenant that does not require compliance with a
financial ratio or test (including the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the “Fixed Amounts”) substantially concurrently or in a
series of related transactions with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on
a provision in such covenant that requires compliance with any such financial ratio or test (any such amounts, the
“Incurrence Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts (and any cash proceeds thereof)
in such covenant shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence
Based Amounts in such covenant in connection with such incurrence, but full pro forma effect shall be given to all
applicable and related transactions (including the use of proceeds of all Indebtedness to be incurred and any
repayments, repurchases and redemptions of Indebtedness) and all other permitted pro forma adjustments.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time any applicable ratio or financial test for any
category based on an Incurrence Based Amount permits Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments, Asset Sales, sale
and leaseback transactions and Investments, as applicable, previously incurred under a category based on a Fixed
Amount, such Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments, Asset Sales, sale and leaseback transactions and
Investments, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been automatically reclassified as incurred under such category
based on an Incurrence Based Amount.

Penn National may elect, pursuant to an officer’s certificate delivered to the Trustee to treat all or any
portion of any revolving commitment or undrawn commitment under any Indebtedness as being incurred and
outstanding at such time and for so long as such commitments remain outstanding (regardless of whether then
drawn), in which case any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment shall not be deemed, for
purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence at such subsequent time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for all purposes hereof, (a) the Master Leases and any
Gaming Lease (and any Guarantee of the foregoing) shall not constitute Indebtedness, Liens or a Capital Lease
Obligation regardless of how such Master Lease or Gaming Lease may be treated under GAAP, (b) any interest
portion of payments in connection with such Master Lease or Gaming Lease shall not constitute consolidated
interest expense (or terms of similar effect) and (c) Consolidated Cash Flow and Consolidated Net Income (and
terms of similar effect) shall be calculated by deducting, without duplication of amounts otherwise deducted, rent,
insurance, property taxes and other amounts and expenses actually paid in cash under the Master Leases or any

-37

-----

Gaming Lease in the applicable period and no deductions in calculating Consolidated Cash Flow or Consolidated
Net Income (and terms of similar effect) shall occur as a result of imputed interest, amounts under the Master Leases
or any Gaming Lease not paid in cash during the relevant period or other non-cash amounts incurred in respect of
the Master Leases or any Gaming Lease; provided that any “true-up” of rent paid in cash pursuant to the Master
Leases or any Gaming Lease shall be accounted for in the fiscal quarter to which such payment relates as if such
payment were originally made in such fiscal quarter.

_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions_

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the indenture or compliance with any
provision of the indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or preferred stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, dividends and dispositions
or distributions), in each case, at the option of Penn National (Penn National’s election to exercise such option, an
“LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such
action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including
as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the indenture shall be deemed to be the date
(the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) that the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered
into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable notice, declaration of a dividend or distribution or
similar event), (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers
and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer is published
on a regulatory information service in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction is made (or that
equivalent notice under equivalent laws, rules or regulations in such other applicable jurisdiction is made), (c) that
notice is given with respect to any redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock requiring irrevocable notice in advance of such redemption,
repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment or (d) that notice is given with respect to any
dividend or other distribution requiring irrevocable notice in advance thereof and, in each case, if, after giving pro
forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including
acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the
use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, dividends or other distributions and dispositions) and
any related pro forma adjustments, Penn National or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to
take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test
or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and
conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Liens, for
example, whether such Liens are to secure Indebtedness that is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date
or at any time thereafter); provided that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall
have become available, Penn National may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets
on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to
be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets and (b) except as contemplated in the
foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions)
shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or
issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of
Liens, repayments, dividends or distributions and dispositions).

For the avoidance of doubt, if Penn National has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or
baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT
Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such
ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated Cash Flow of Penn National or the Person subject
to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or
failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was
determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied
with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such
requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such
Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the

-38

-----

availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited
Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such
Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption,
purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated,
expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test
or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction.

_Restricted Payments_

Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(A) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on account of Penn National’s or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (other than (x) dividends or distributions payable in Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Penn National or (y) to Penn National or a Restricted
Subsidiary of Penn National);

(B) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (x) any Equity Interests of Penn National
(other than Disqualified Stock within 365 days of the Stated Maturity of such Disqualified Stock) or
(y) any preferred stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National (other than within 365 days of the
Stated Maturity thereof), in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), other than any such Equity
Interests or preferred stock held by Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National;

(C) make any payment of principal on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value, any Indebtedness of Penn National that is subordinated in right of payment
to the notes (except a payment within 365 days of the Stated Maturity thereof and other than
Indebtedness permitted under clause (6) of the covenant described below under the caption
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”); or

(D) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (A) through (D) being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”),

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of
such Restricted Payment;

(2) Penn National would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto
and to any related transactions as if such Restricted Payment and related transactions had been made
at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first
paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock”; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made
by Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the 5.875% Issue Date (excluding Restricted
Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph (other than clause (1) thereof)), is less than the
sum, without duplication, of:

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of Penn National for the period (taken as one accounting
period) from January 1, 2014 to the end of Penn National’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for
which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if
such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus

-39

-----

(b) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and Cash Equivalents and the Fair Market
Value of assets or consideration other than cash or Cash Equivalents, received by Penn National
since the 5.875% Issue Date (i) as a contribution to its common equity capital, or (ii) from or in
exchange for the issue or sale of Equity Interests of Penn National (other than Disqualified
Stock), or (iii) from or in exchange for the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable
Disqualified Stock or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of Penn National, in each case
in this clause (iii), that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other
than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of Penn
National), plus

(c) to the extent that any Restricted Investment (including to designate a Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary) that was made after the 5.875% Issue Date and was included in the
calculation of Restricted Payments made under the indenture:

(x) is sold for cash or Cash Equivalents or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash or Cash
Equivalents, in whole or in part (including through the sale of capital stock or other
securities of an Unrestricted Subsidiary other than to Penn National or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries), or

(y) is repurchased or redeemed by any person (other than Penn National or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) or results in, or is otherwise returned or reduced by, the payment of principal,
interest, dividends or distributions, or repayments of loans or advances, or other transfers of
assets, or the satisfaction, release, expiration, cancellation or reduction (other than by means
of payments by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Indebtedness or other
obligations (including any such Indebtedness or other obligations guaranteed by Penn
National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Investment Guarantee or
reductions in liabilities under Guarantees), or any payments under management contracts or
services agreements,

in each case, 100% of the aggregate reduction of or return with respect to, and all other
payments, and the Fair Market Value of assets other than cash, received with respect to,
such Restricted Investment, plus

(d) to the extent that any Restricted Investment was made after the 5.875% Issue Date in an entity
that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (other than through the redesignation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary to which clause (e) below shall apply) or is merged, consolidated or
amalgamated with or into, or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is liquidated into, Penn National
or a Restricted Subsidiary, and such Restricted Investment remains outstanding, the aggregate
amount of such Restricted Investment, plus

(e) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Penn National is redesignated as a Restricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the covenant “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries,” or has been merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or into, or transfers or
conveys its assets to, or is liquidated into, Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case
after the 5.875% Issue Date, the Fair Market Value of Penn National’s and its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Investment in such Subsidiary (directly or indirectly) as of the date of such
redesignation, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, transfer or conveyance or liquidation.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption
within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or distribution or giving of the redemption
notice, as applicable, if at the date of declaration or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may
be, the dividend, distribution or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of the
indenture;

-40

-----

(2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, discharge, defeasance (whether by covenant or legal
defeasance) or other acquisition of any Indebtedness of Penn National or any of its Subsidiaries that is
subordinated to the notes or of any Equity Interests of Penn National (including all accrued interest on
the Indebtedness, all accrued or accumulated dividends on the Equity Interests and the amount of all
penalties, fees, costs, expenses, discounts and premiums incurred in connection therewith and any
original issue discount or debt issuance costs with respect thereto) in exchange for, or by conversion
into, or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn
National) of, Equity Interests of Penn National (other than Disqualified Stock) or of any Person that is
or becomes, substantially concurrently with such transaction, a holding company of Penn National;
_provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption,_
repurchase, retirement, discharge, defeasance or other acquisition will be excluded from clause (3)(b)
of the preceding paragraph;

(3) (x) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, discharge, defeasance (whether by covenant or legal
defeasance), or other acquisition of any Indebtedness of Penn National or any of its Subsidiaries that
is subordinated to the notes with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of, or in exchange for,
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, or (y) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other
acquisition of Disqualified Stock of Penn National or preferred stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of
Penn National with the net cash proceeds from an issuance of, or in exchange for, Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness constituting Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, respectively;

(4) the payment of any dividend by a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National to the holders of its Equity
Interests (other than preferred stock) on a pro rata basis;

(5) redemptions, repurchases or repayments of Indebtedness or Equity Interests of Penn National or any
of its Subsidiaries to the extent required by any Gaming Authority having jurisdiction over Penn
National or any Restricted Subsidiary or deemed necessary by the Board of Directors of Penn
National in order to avoid the suspension, revocation or denial of a gaming license by any Gaming
Authority, or as required under “—Redemption—Gaming Redemption” above;

(6) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement of any Equity Interests of Penn National

each case, portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant.

For purposes of this covenant and any other covenants of the indenture, it is understood that Penn National
may rely on internal or publicly reported financial statements even though there may be subsequent adjustments
(including review and audit adjustments) to such financial statements. Any Restricted Payment, incurrence of
Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or other action that complied with the conditions
of this covenant or such other covenants, made in reliance on such calculation by Penn National based on such
internal or publicly reported financial statements, shall be deemed to continue to comply with the conditions of this

_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_

Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise,
with respect to (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and Penn National will not issue
any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock;
_provided, however, that Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_
Debt), Penn National may issue Disqualified Stock and Penn National’s Restricted Subsidiaries may issue preferred
stock if, in any such case, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Penn National’s most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least
2.00 to 1.0 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom and
including as set forth in the definition of “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio”), as if the additional Indebtedness had been
incurred or the preferred stock or Disqualified Stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such
four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence or issuance of any of the following
items of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, as applicable (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by Penn National and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness and
letters of credit pursuant to the Credit Facilities or otherwise; provided that the aggregate principal
amount of all Indebtedness then classified as having been incurred in reliance upon this clause (1)
that remains outstanding under such Credit Facilities or otherwise after giving effect to such
incurrence does not exceed the sum of (a) $3,050.0 million, plus (b) any additional or other
amount, so long as, solely in the case of this clause (b), after giving pro forma effect to such
incurrence, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio of Penn National would be no greater than
2.75 to 1.0 (deducting Development Expenses from Consolidated Total Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (c) of the definition of Consolidated Total Indebtedness) and 3.0 to 1.0 (without deducting
Development Expenses from Consolidated Total Indebtedness pursuant to clause (c) of the
definition of Consolidated Total Indebtedness); provided, however, that the maximum amount
permitted to be outstanding under this clause (1) shall not be deemed to limit additional
Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities to the extent the incurrence of such additional
Indebtedness is permitted pursuant to any of the other provisions under this caption “—Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(2) the incurrence by Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

(3) the incurrence by Penn National of Indebtedness represented by the notes to be issued on the date
of the indenture in the principal amount of $400.0 million;

Purchase Money Indebtedness and Capital Lease Obligations, or (b) Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock in connection with the purchase, acquisition, lease, construction,
development, installation, renovation, repair, expansion, improvement or refurbishment of any
facility, facilities or assets used or useful in (whether by the purchase of assets or of Equity
Interests of any person owning such assets) any Permitted Business, in the case of each of clauses
(a) and (b), including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred or issued to refinance any
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock incurred or issued pursuant to this clause (4),

the aggregate at any time outstanding;

Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refinance,
Indebtedness (including an Investment Guarantee), Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that was
permitted by the indenture to be incurred or issued under the first paragraph of this covenant or
clause (2), (3), (4), (9), (20) or, without duplication, (23) of this paragraph or this clause (5);

(6) the incurrence by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany
Indebtedness or the issuance of preferred stock by a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case between or
among Penn National and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including Indebtedness or preferred
stock of any Restricted Subsidiary to Penn National or another Restricted Subsidiary or of Penn
National to a Restricted Subsidiary constituting the purchase price in respect of intercompany
transfers of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business); provided, however, that
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness, or
preferred stock being held by a Person other than Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn
National and (b) any sale or other transfer (excluding Liens permitted by the indenture) of any
such Indebtedness or preferred stock to a Person that is neither Penn National nor a Restricted
Subsidiary of Penn National will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such
Indebtedness by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary or an issuance of preferred stock by
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);

(7) the incurrence by Penn National and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations
that are entered into for bona fide hedging activities and not for speculative purposes (including,
without limitation, Hedging Obligations or other hedge or swap or option agreements entered into

National or a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National that was permitted to be incurred by another

bonds, surety appeal or similar bonds, completion guarantees, letters of credit or similar
obligations provided by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course

Subsidiary, other than guarantees of Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring all or any

(a) such Indebtedness is not reflected at the time of such incurrence or assumption on the balance
sheet of Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (obligations referred to in a
footnote or footnotes to financial statements and not otherwise reflected on the balance sheet
will not be deemed to be reflected on that balance sheet for purposes of this clause (a)); and

(b) in the case of a disposition, the maximum assumable liability in respect of that Indebtedness
shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market
Value of those non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by Penn National and/or that

issued to finance a merger, consolidation or other acquisition; provided that (i) immediately after

(24) the incurrence or issuance by Penn National and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional

Refinancing Indebtedness incurred or issued to refinance any other Indebtedness incurred or
issued pursuant to this clause (24), not to exceed the greater of $500.0 million and 50% of
Consolidated Cash Flow for the Applicable Measurement Period (it being understood that
Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, pursuant to this paragraph
(24) shall cease to be deemed incurred, issued or outstanding for purposes of this clause (24) but
shall be deemed to be incurred or issued for purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from
and after the first date on which Penn National or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
could have incurred such Indebtedness or issued such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under
the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on this clause (24)).

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (24) above or is
entitled to be incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Penn National will be permitted to
classify such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock on the date of its incurrence or issuance in
any manner that complies with this covenant. In addition, Penn National may, at any time, change the classification
of an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (or any portion thereof) to any other clause or to
the first paragraph of this covenant, provided that Penn National or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary would be
permitted to incur or issue such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (or portion thereof)
pursuant to such other clause or the first paragraph of this covenant, as the case may be, at such time of
reclassification. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have
been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”.

In connection with the incurrence or issuance, as applicable, of (x) revolving loan Indebtedness under this
covenant or (y) any commitment relating to the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock under this covenant and the granting of any Lien to secure any such Indebtedness, Penn National or
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such incurrence or issuance and the granting of any such Lien as
having occurred on the date of first incurrence or issuance of such revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment (such
date, the “Deemed Date”), and any related subsequent actual incurrence or issuance or granting of any such Lien
therefor will be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been incurred or issued and granted on such
Deemed Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio and usage of any other baskets or ratios under the indenture (as applicable).

Accrual of interest, the accrual or accumulation of dividends, the accretion of accreted value and the
payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock will
not be deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock for purposes of
this covenant. The maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that Penn National or a
Restricted Subsidiary may incur or issue shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, due solely to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence or
issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount or
liquidation value of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or preferred stock was incurred or issued, in the case of term debt, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or first
committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock is incurred or issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a
foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or
liquidation value of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock in the applicable currency
does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation value of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock being refinanced in the applicable currency (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness, all accrued or
accumulated dividends on the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the amount of all prepayment penalties,
fees, costs, expenses, discounts and premiums incurred in connection therewith and any original issue discount in
connection therewith).

The principal amount of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock incurred or issued to
refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, if incurred or issued in a different currency from
the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

A change in GAAP that results in an obligation existing at the time of such change, not previously
classified as Indebtedness, becoming Indebtedness, or that results in a liability for all or part of such obligation
having to be recognized, will not be deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of, which could, in turn, constitute a
default under such other Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

_Guarantees of Debt Securities_

Following the date of the indenture, no Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National will directly or indirectly
guarantee, or become jointly and severally liable with respect to, any Debt Securities of Penn National (excluding, in
any event, (x) Acquired Debt and (y) guarantees of such Acquired Debt or any other Indebtedness of Penn National
to the extent a guarantee is required as a result of the assumption by Penn National of such Acquired Debt described
in clause (x) pursuant to the terms thereof as they existed at the time of and after giving effect to (and are not
modified in contemplation of, other than to give effect to) the assumption of or acquisition of such Acquired Debt)
issued after the date of the indenture, unless a guarantee is provided in respect of the notes by such Restricted
Subsidiary.

_Liens_

Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness (other than
Permitted Liens) upon any of its property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”),
unless all payments due under the indenture and the notes are secured (1) on an equal and ratable basis with, or on a
senior basis to, the obligations so secured (if such obligations rank equally in right of payment with the notes) until
such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien or (2) on a senior basis to the obligations so secured to
the extent such obligations are subordinated in right of payment to the notes. Any Lien created for the benefit of the

-48

-----

Holders of the notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in
the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part
under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in
the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Penn National may, in its sole
discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if incurred or issued at such later time),
such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant and at the time of incurrence, issuance, classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the
amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of
the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or
any portion thereof) will be treated as being incurred, issued or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or
any portion thereof) or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof without giving pro forma effect to such item (or portion
thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness that may be incurred or issued pursuant to any other
clause or paragraph (or portion thereof) at such time. In addition, with respect to any revolving loan Indebtedness or
commitment relating to the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness that is designated to be incurred or issued on any
date pursuant to the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock,” any Lien that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also be designated by Penn National
or any Restricted Subsidiary to be incurred on such date and, in such event, any related subsequent actual incurrence
of such Lien shall be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to be incurred on such prior date, including for
purposes of calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the incurrence or issuance of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness that is not deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above
under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” or (b) Penn
National (or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Penn
National) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition has been made) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Penn National and its Restricted
Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction.

Upon any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of
Penn National’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole, in compliance with the provisions of this
“Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant, Penn National will be released from the obligations under the
notes and the indenture except with respect to any obligations that arise from, or are related to, such transaction.

This “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to:

(i) a merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets
between or among Penn National and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

_Transactions with Affiliates_

Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from,

or for the benefit of, any Affiliate involving aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of $12.5 million and
1.25% of Consolidated Cash Flow for the Applicable Measurement Period (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to Penn
National or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person (as
determined by Penn National in good faith) or in the event that there are no comparable transactions
involving Persons who are not Affiliates of Penn National or the revent Restricted Subsidiary to apply
for comparative purposes, is otherise on terms that, taken as a whole, Penn National has determined in
its good faith to be fair to Penn National or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary; and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of $50.0 million and 5% of Consolidated Cash Flow

clause (1) above and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the
Board of Directors consisting of disinterested members of the Board of Directors).

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

arrangements and benefit plans or arrangements and any transactions contemplated by any of the
foregoing relating to compensation and benefits matters, including any issuances of securities, loans

(2) transactions between or among Penn National and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries (including any entity

provided on behalf of officers, directors or employees of Penn National or any of its Restricted

(7) transactions disclosed in Penn National’s Commission filings prior to the date of the indenture and
any agreements, instruments or obligations as in effect on the Issue Date and transactions
contemplated thereby and any renewals, replacements, amendments, supplements or other
modifications thereof (so long as the terms of such renewals, replacements, amendments, supplements
or modifications are not less favorable to the Holders of the notes in any material respect, taken as a
whole, as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date, as determined by Penn
National in good faith);

(8) the occurrence of a Trigger Event and the transactions contemplated by each applicable Trust
Agreement;

(9) transactions with persons who have entered into an agreement, contract or arrangement with Penn
National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to manage, own or operate a Gaming Facility because
Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries have not received the requisite Gaming Approvals or are
otherwise not permitted to manage, own or operate such Gaming Facility under applicable Gaming
Laws; provided that such transactions shall have been approved by a majority of the disinterested
members of Penn National’s Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the
Board of Directors consisting of disinterested members of the Board of Directors) and determined by
them to be in the best interests of Penn National;

(10) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, contractors, landlords, lessors, lessees, licensors,
licensees, joint venture or development partners or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture
which are fair to Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in the determination
of Penn National’s Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the Board of
Directors) or management, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(11) transactions with joint ventures and Subsidiaries thereof and Unrestricted Subsidiaries relating to the
provision of management services, overhead, sharing of customer lists and customer loyalty programs

members of the Board of Directors) (a director shall be disinterested if he or she has no interest in
such joint venture or Unrestricted Subsidiary other than through Penn National and its Restricted
Subsidiaries); provided that no Affiliate of Penn National (other than Penn National’s Restricted
Subsidiaries) has an interest (other than indirectly through Penn National and other than Unrestricted
Subsidiaries or such joint ventures) in any such joint venture or Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(13) transactions between Penn National or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person, which is an

being a director of Penn National; provided, however, that any such director abstains from voting as a
director of Penn National on any matter involving such other Person;

(14) transactions with a Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of such
transaction that becomes an Affiliate as a result of such transaction; and

of such lessor) and any agreements with respect to a Social Gaming Disposition Transaction and, in
each case, any actions or transactions pursuant thereto or contemplated thereby.

_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_

Each of the Existing Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as of the date of the
indenture. Further, the Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary
if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
(which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the designation of the Existing Unrestricted Subsidiaries as such
on the Issue Date), the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Penn National and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the
time of the designation and will constitute Restricted Investments under the first paragraph of the covenant
described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or, if eligible, Permitted Investments, as determined by
Penn National. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the
Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default.

_Master Lease_

Neither Penn National nor Tenant will enter into any amendment to the Master Lease if such amendment
would materially impair the ability of Penn National to satisfy its obligations to make payments on the notes.
Tenant shall not transfer its rights or obligations under the Master Lease to any Person other than to Penn National
or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that no such transfer shall be permitted hereunder unless expressly
permitted under the Master Lease or consented to in writing by Landlord.

_Reports_

So long as the notes are outstanding, Penn National will deliver to the trustee within 30 days after the filing
of the same with the Commission, copies of the quarterly and annual reports of Penn National and of the
information, documents and other reports, if any, which Penn National is required to file with the Commission
pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding that Penn National may not be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, so long as the notes are outstanding, Penn
National will file with the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the
Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports of the Issuer which may
be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in respect of a security listed and registered on a national
securities exchange as may be prescribed in such rules and regulations. The availability of the foregoing materials
on the Commission’s EDGAR service (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to satisfy Penn National’s
obligations to furnish such materials to the trustee and to the Holders of notes, upon Holder request; provided,
_however, that the trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information,_
documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR service (or its successor).

In the event that: (1) the rules and regulations of the Commission permit the Penn National and any direct
or indirect parent of Penn National to report at such parent entity’s level on a consolidated basis or (2) any direct or
indirect parent of Penn National is or becomes a guarantor of the notes, then in each case consolidated reporting at
such parent entity’s level in a manner consistent with that described under the requirements set forth above under
“—Reports” for Penn National will satisfy such requirements, and Penn National is permitted to satisfy its
obligations under “—Reports” with respect to financial information relating to Penn National by furnishing financial
information relating to such direct or indirect parent; provided that in the case of clauses (1) and (2) above such
financial information is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences
between the information relating to such direct or indirect parent and any of its Subsidiaries other than Penn
National and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to Penn National and its Subsidiaries on
a standalone basis, on the other hand within 15 Business Days of furnishing or making such information available to
the Trustee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph.

-55

-----

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the trustee is for informational purposes only and
the trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive or actual notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including Penn National’s compliance with any of its covenants
under the indenture (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on officer’s certificates). The trustee shall
have no responsibility for the filing, timeliness or content of any reports, information or documents. The trustee shall
have no obligation to determine whether or not such reports, information or documents have been filed pursuant to
the SEC’s EDGAR filing system (or its successor) or postings to any website have occurred, and the trustee shall
have no duty to participate in or monitor any conference calls.

In addition, Penn National has agreed that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, if Penn National is
not required to file with the Commission the reports required by the first paragraph of this covenant, it will furnish to
the Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) Penn National defaults in the payment when due of interest on the notes and such default continues
for a period of 30 days;

(2) Penn National defaults in the payment when due of the principal of or premium, if any, on the notes
when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon redemption (including in connection with
an offer to purchase) or otherwise;

(3) subject to the last paragraph of this covenant, failure by Penn National or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries fails to observe or perform any other covenant, representation, warranty or other
agreement in the indenture or the notes for 60 days after Penn National’s receipt of notice from the
trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding,
unless such failure to comply has been waived by the required holders;

(4) a default occurs under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Penn National or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of
which is guaranteed by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary), in each case other than Indebtedness owed to Penn National or a Restricted
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the date of the
indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness at final maturity (after giving effect
to any applicable grace periods) (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its final maturity, and,

in each case, the due and payable principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the due
and payable principal amount of any other such Indebtedness, under which there has been a Payment
Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated aggregates in excess of $200.0 million;
_provided, that this clause (4) shall not apply to any Investment Guarantee or Investment Guarantee_
Indebtedness unless Penn National or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries defaults in the performance of
its payment obligations in respect of its Investment Guarantee of such Investment Guarantee
Indebtedness;

-56

-----

(5) failure by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to
pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million (to the extent not covered by insurance or
indemnification), which judgments are not paid, discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the indenture with respect to Penn National or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; and

(7) after the effectiveness thereof, the Master Lease shall terminate or otherwise cease to be effective,
other than upon the expiration or termination thereof with respect to any particular property or
properties pursuant to the Master Lease or an amendment, waiver or modification of the Master Lease
not prohibited by “—Certain Covenants—Master Lease.”

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to
Penn National, all notes then outstanding will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.
If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount
of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such
declaration may occur with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years
prior to the date of such declaration.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event
of Default and all consequences thereof shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any
action by the trustee or the Holders of the notes, if within 20 days after such Event of Default occurred Penn
National delivers an officer’s certificate to the Trustee stating that:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been repaid, redeemed,
repurchased, defeased, discharged, retired, acquired or otherwise satisfied;

(2) the requisite number of holders or lenders of such Indebtedness have rescinded, annulled or waived
the default, acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the Payment Default or acceleration that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Holders of the notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the indenture.
Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the trustee or any trust
or power conferred onto it. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest, if any, on any note, the trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a responsible officer of
the trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the notes. Holders
of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes by written notice to the
trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on, the notes; provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related
payment default that resulted from such acceleration.

In the event that the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes deliver to the
trustee a notice of a Default or an Event of Default or an acceleration, such Holders also shall deliver a copy of such
notice to the Landlord.

If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if a responsible officer of the trustee has
received written notice of such Default or Event of Default, the trustee shall mail to Holders of notes a notice of the
Default or Event of Default within 90 days after a responsible officer of the trustee has received notice of such
Default or Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of,

-57

-----

premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any note, the trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a responsible
officer of the trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the
notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a default by Penn National or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the performance of any of their respective obligations under the indenture, including any default in
the payment of any sums payable thereunder, then, in each and every such case, subject to applicable Gaming Laws,
the Landlord shall have the right (subject to the terms of the Master Lease), but not the obligation, to cause the
default or defaults to be cured or remedied (to the extent such default is susceptible to cure or remedy) prior to the
end of any applicable notice and cure periods set forth in the indenture, and any such tender of payment or
performance by Landlord shall be accepted by the trustee and the Holders of the notes and shall constitute payment
and/or performance by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary for purposes of the indenture.

Notwithstanding clause (3) of the first paragraph above or any other provision of the indenture, except as
provided in the final sentence of this paragraph, the sole remedy for any failure to comply by Penn National with the
covenant described under the caption “—Reports” shall be the payment of liquidated damages as described in the
following sentence, such failure to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default, and Holders of the notes shall
not have any right under the indenture to accelerate the maturity of the notes as a result of any such failure to
comply. If a failure to comply by Penn National with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports”
continues for 60 days after Penn National receives notice of such failure to comply in accordance with clause (3) of
the first paragraph above (such notice, the “Reports Default Notice”), and is continuing on the 60th day following
Penn National’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice, Penn National will pay liquidated damages to all Holders of
notes at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the notes from the 60th day following Penn
National’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice to but not including the earlier of (x) the 121st day following Penn
National’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice and (y) the date on which the failure to comply by Penn National
with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports” shall have been cured or waived. On the earlier of the
date specified in the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y), such liquidated damages will cease to accrue. If the
failure to comply by Penn National with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports” shall not have been
cured or waived on or before the 121st day following Penn National’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice, then the
failure to comply by Penn National with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports” shall on such 121st
day constitute an Event of Default. A failure to comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports”
automatically shall cease to be continuing and shall be deemed cured at such time as Penn National furnishes to the
trustee the applicable information or report (it being understood that the availability of such information or report on
the Commission’s EDGAR service (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to satisfy Penn National’s obligation
to furnish such information or report to the trustee); provided, however, that the trustee shall have no obligation
whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the
EDGAR service (or its successor).

Any notice of Default, notice of a continuing Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the
trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of a continuing Event of Default, notice of acceleration or take any
other action relating to a Default or Event of Default other than a bankruptcy default (a “Noteholder Direction”)
with respect to the notes provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by
a separate written representation from each such Holder delivered to Penn National and the trustee that such Holder
is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that have represented to such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which
representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a
continuing representation until the resulting Default or Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the
notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction,
to covenant to provide Penn National with such other information as Penn National may reasonably request from
time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days
of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any
clearinghouse or any other depositary, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder
shall be provided by DTC or its nominee, such clearinghouse or such other depositary or by the beneficial owner of
an interest in the notes after delivery to the trustee of the evidence of beneficial ownership satisfactory to the trustee.

-58

-----

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, Penn National
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the trustee an officer’s certificate stating that Penn National has
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at
such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and
the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed
pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following
the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, Penn National provides to the trustee an
officer’s certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with
respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending
satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the
percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other
than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the trustee which obligations shall continue to survive),
with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration shall be voided and
the trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of
Default.

For the avoidance of doubt, the trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
delivered to it in accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to
Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The
trustee shall have no liability to Penn National, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a
Noteholder Direction.

With their acquisition of the notes, each Holder consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by
the trustee to Penn National in accordance with the terms of the indenture. Each Holder of the notes waives any and
all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the
trustee in respect of, and agrees that the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes in accordance
with the foregoing three paragraphs, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions
in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or direct or indirect stockholder, past, present or future, of
Penn National or any successor entity, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of Penn National under the
notes or the indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

Penn National may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect
to the outstanding notes (“Legal Defeasance”). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that Penn National shall
be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding notes, which shall
thereafter be deemed to be “outstanding” only for the purposes of this section and the other sections of the indenture
referred to in (1) and (2) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such notes and the indenture (and
the trustee, on demand of and at the expense of Penn National, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the
same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged under the
indenture:

-59

-----

(1) the rights of Holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of or interest
or premium, if any, on such notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) Penn National’s obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, the
registration of notes, the replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance
of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee, and Penn National’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, Penn National may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of Penn National
released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter
any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the
notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including the events described in clauses (1),
(2), or (6) under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” above pertaining to Penn National) described
under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to
the notes. Penn National may exercise Legal Defeasance regardless of whether it previously has exercised Covenant
Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) Penn National must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the
notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S.
dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the case of noncallable non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and noncallable Government Securities but not in the case of cash in U.S. dollars only, in the opinion or based
on the report of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, investment bank or
appraisal firm, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, on and accrued and unpaid interest on the
outstanding notes on the Stated Maturity or on a redemption date, as the case may be, and Penn
National must specify whether the notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption
date; provided that, with respect to any redemption pursuant to “Redemption—Optional
Redemption— Optional Redemption Prior To, 2024,” the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount is so deposited with the trustee
equal to the redemption amount computed using the Treasury Rate as of the third Business Day
preceding the date of such deposit with the trustee, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption
date only required to be deposited with the trustee on the redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, Penn National must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of
counsel to the trustee confirming that (a) Penn National has received from, or there has been
published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the indenture, there has
been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that
the Holders or the beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject
to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, Penn National must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of
counsel confirming that the Holders or the beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

-60

-----

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than
a Default or Event of Default resulting from transactions occurring substantially contemporaneously
with the borrowing of funds, or from the borrowing of funds, to be applied to such deposit or other
Indebtedness which is being repaid, redeemed, repurchased, defeased or discharged and, in each case,
the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the indenture or any
agreement or instrument governing any other Indebtedness which is being repaid, redeemed,
repurchased, defeased or discharged or otherwise as a result of transactions occurring
contemporaneously with the borrowing of funds, or from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
make the deposit required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance or any similar
deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection
therewith) to which Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which Penn
National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound; and

(6) Penn National must deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance
have been complied with.

The Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will be effective on the day on which all the applicable
conditions above have been satisfied. Upon compliance with the foregoing, the trustee shall execute proper
instrument(s) acknowledging such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs, the indenture or the notes may be amended or
supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding
voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, notes), and any existing default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the notes, except a payment default resulting
from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the indenture or the notes may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes voting as a
single class (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
notes).

Without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the principal amount of notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to
the redemption price of the notes (other than provisions described above under the caption “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and other than provisions specifying the notice periods for
effecting a redemption);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on
the notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in the notes;

-61

contractual rights of Holders of notes expressly set forth in the indenture to receive payments of
principal of or interest or premium, if any, on the notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any note (other than a payment required by one of the
provisions described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”); or

(8) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any Holder of notes, Penn National and the trustee
may amend or supplement the indenture or the notes:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect, mistake or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes (provided that such
notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), or in a manner such that such notes are described in Section
163(f)(2)(B) of the Code);

or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Penn National and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

(4) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository;

(5) to comply with applicable Gaming Laws or to provide for requirements imposed by applicable
Gaming Authorities;

(6) to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
indenture, including the covenant under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(7) to make any change (x) that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of notes
(including to provide for any guarantees of the notes or any collateral securing the notes or any
guarantees of the notes) and, in each case, the release, suspension or termination thereof, or (y) that in
the good faith determination of Penn National does not materially adversely affect the contractual
rights under the indenture of any Holder of notes;

(8) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect any qualification of the indenture
under the TIA;

(9) to make any amendment to the provisions of the indenture relating to the transfer and legending of the
notes; provided, however, that (a) compliance with the indenture as so amended would not result in
the notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and
(b) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer the
notes;

(10) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor trustee under the indenture;

(11) to provide for a reduction in the minimum denominations of the notes; or

(12) to conform the text of the indenture or the notes to any provision of this Description of Notes.

-62

-----

The trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this section if the
amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the trustee. The
trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any amendment or supplement that adversely impacts its rights,
duties or immunities.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder,
when:

(1) either:

(a) all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that have been
replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and, if
provided for in the indenture, thereafter repaid to Penn National, have been delivered to the
trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all notes that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the giving of an irrevocable notice of redemption or otherwise or will
become due and payable within one year (or are to be irrevocably called for redemption within
one year) and Penn National has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee
as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government
Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest,
to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the notes not delivered to the trustee for
cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the date of maturity or redemption; provided that, with respect to any redemption
pursuant to “Redemption—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption Prior To, 2024,”
the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an
amount is so deposited with the trustee equal to the redemption amount computed using the
Treasury Rate as of the third Business Day preceding the date of such deposit with the trustee,
with any deficit as of the date of the redemption date only required to be deposited with the
trustee on the redemption date;

(2) Penn National has paid or caused to be paid all other sums then payable by it under the indenture; and

(3) Penn National has delivered irrevocable written instructions to the trustee under the indenture to apply

may be.

In addition, Penn National must deliver an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel to the trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

The satisfaction and discharge will be effective on the day on which all the applicable conditions above
have been satisfied. Upon compliance with the foregoing, the trustee shall execute proper instrument(s)
acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge of all of Penn National’s obligations under the notes and the indenture.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the trustee becomes a creditor of Penn National, the indenture limits its right to obtain payment of claims
in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The
trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue or resign.

-63

-----

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the trustee, subject to
certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will
be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of such person’s
own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the indenture at the request of any Holder of notes, unless such Holder has offered to the trustee security and
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, cost or expense.

“Unrestricted Subsidiary” means any Subsidiary of Penn National that is designated by the Board of
Directors as an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to a Board Resolution, but only to the extent that as of the time of
such designation:

(1) either (A) such Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of $1,000,000 or less or (B)
immediately after giving pro forma effect to such designation, either (x) Penn National could incur
$1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph
of the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock” or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Penn National and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than or equal to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Penn
National and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such designation;

(2) such Subsidiary is not, at the time of such designation, party to any agreement, contract, arrangement
or understanding with Penn National or any Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National unless the terms
of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding are no less favorable to Penn National
or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not
Affiliates of Penn National, or would otherwise be permitted if entered into at the time of such
designation pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Transactions With Affiliates”; and

(3) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither Penn National nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect Investment (including, without duplication, a deemed
Investment at the time of designation in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Investment
in the relevant Subsidiary owned by Penn and its Restricted Subsidiaries) that could not have been

Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” (including as a Permitted Investment);

_provided that the Existing Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall initially be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries without_
compliance with the preceding clauses (1), (2) and (3). An Unrestricted Subsidiary shall also automatically include
(without any further action required by the Board of Directors, compliance with the preceding conditions or
otherwise) any Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of Penn National (other than any of the Existing Unrestricted Subsidiaries)
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the trustee by filing with the trustee a certified copy of the Board
Resolution giving effect to such designation and an officer’s certificate certifying that such designation complied
with the preceding conditions. If any Unrestricted Subsidiary failed to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time of designation, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for
purposes of the indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary of Penn National as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date
under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock,” Penn National will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of Penn National may
at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will
be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is
permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock,” calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of
the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such
designation.

“VICI” means VICI Properties, Inc.

“Voting Stock” of any Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the time
entitled to vote in the election of the Board of Directors of such Person.

“Weighted Average Life To Maturity” means, when applied to any Indebtedness at any date, the number of
years obtained by dividing:

-94

-----

(1) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the amount of each then remaining installment,
sinking fund, serial maturity or other required payments of principal, including payment at final
maturity, in respect of the Indebtedness, by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest onetwelfth) that will elapse between such date and the making of such payment; by

(2) the then outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness.

“Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary” means, with respect to any Person, any Wholly Owned Subsidiary
of such Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, all references to any
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary means a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National.

**BOOK ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under
Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. The notes will only
be issued in fully registered form, without interest coupons, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. No notes will be issued in bearer form. The notes sold in the offering will be
issued only against payment in immediately available funds.

Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A initially will be represented by permanent global notes in fully
registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited upon issuance
with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”), and registered in the name of
Cede & Co. (a nominee of DTC) or another DTC nominee. The Restricted Global Notes will be subject to
restrictions on transfer set forth therein and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under “Notice to
Investors.”

Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act initially will be
represented by temporary global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (the “Temporary Regulation
S Global Note”) and will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the
name of a nominee of such depositary. Prior to the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and
the issue date of the notes (such period through and including such 40th day, the “distribution compliance period”),
a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be held only through Euroclear Bank
S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme
(“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a
restricted global note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. The Temporary Regulation
S Global Note will be exchangeable for a single permanent global note (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Note”
and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Note, a “Regulation S Global Note” and together with the
Restricted Global Notes, the “Global Notes”) after the expiration of the distribution compliance period and the
certification required by Regulation S. Prior to such time, a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S
Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Restricted Global
Note only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the
trustee of a written certification to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

_The Global Notes. We expect that pursuant to procedures established by DTC:_

    - upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the
principal amount of notes of the individual beneficial interests represented by such global securities to
the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary; and

    - ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such
ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to
interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than
participants).

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (“participants”) or
persons who hold interests through participants. QIBs may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through
DTC if they are participants in such system or directly through organizations which are participants in such system.

Investors may hold their interest in the Regulation S Global Note directly Euroclear or Clearstream, if they
are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Investors
may also hold their interests in the Regulation S Global Note through organizations other than Euroclear or
Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as

-96

-----

its depository for the interests that held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its
participants.

So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the
case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all
purposes under the indenture governing the notes. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be
able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the
indenture with respect to the notes.

Payments of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its
nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of us, the trustee or any Paying Agent (or any of
our or their agents) will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest
in respect of the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its
nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held
through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with
securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such
payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules
and will be settled in clearinghouse funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. If a holder requires physical
delivery of a certificated security for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of the notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes, in
accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture governing the
notes.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as
depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or
Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction
meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC
depository to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in
DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting
for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that
purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or
Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the
sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but
will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or
Clearstream following the DTC settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of those settlement systems, they are under no
obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be changed or discontinued at any time. Neither
we nor the trustee, nor our or its agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited purpose trust company
organized under the laws of the State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing

-97

-----

corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “Clearing Agency” registered pursuant to
the provisions of section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and
facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates.
Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and other
organizations. Indirect access to the DTC system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly
(“indirect participants”).

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee, not our or its agents, will have any responsibility for
the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

_Certificated Securities. If DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the Global_
Notes and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days, certificated securities will be issued in exchange
for the Global Notes, which certificates will bear the legend referred to under “Notice to Investors.”

In connection with any proposed transfer outside the book entry-only system, the transferor shall provide
the trustee with all information necessary to allow the trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting
obligations, including, without limitation, any cost basis reporting obligations under Internal Revenue Code Section
6045. The trustee may rely on the information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the
accuracy of such information.

**CERTAIN ERISA AND OTHER PLAN CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

ERISA imposes certain requirements on employee benefit plans subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA, as set forth in Title I thereof, and on entities that are deemed under ERISA to hold the assets
of such plans (“ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments
by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the
requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be
made in accordance with the documents governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan or of a plan (or entity deemed to hold the assets of a plan), such as an individual retirement account,
that is not subject to ERISA but is subject to Section 4975 of the Code (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”). Such
a transaction could be prohibited if the transaction involves certain parties related to the Plan (referred to as “parties
in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code) or if the Plan fiduciary causing the use of plan
assets in the transaction has a prohibited conflict of interest or self-interest related to the transaction. Among other
potential effects, a party in interest or disqualified person that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may
be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and a fiduciary that causes a
Plan to enter into a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code.

Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,
may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar
to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such
plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the notes or exchange notes to determine the need for and
the availability of, if necessary, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to acquire and hold any notes or any interest in a note with the assets of
such Plan should consider, among other things, whether such acquisition and holding may constitute or result in a
direct or indirect prohibited transaction with a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to such Plan and,
if so, whether exemptive relief may be available for the transaction. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons
could include, without limitation, the issuer of the notes, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates.

The U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may
provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition or holding of the
notes or an interest in notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions
effected by an independent “qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by
insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to
transactions directed by an in-house asset manager). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section
4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions involving certain non-fiduciary
service providers or their affiliates. One or more of these exemptions or another exemption or exception could
provide an exemption for the acquisition and holding of the notes or interests in notes from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code if its conditions are satisfied. However, there can be
no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the notes or interests in notes or that all of the conditions of any such exemption will be
satisfied.

-99

-----

**Representation**

By acceptance of a note or an interest in a note, each acquiror and subsequent transferee will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either (1) it is not a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by such acquiror or
transferee to acquire or hold the notes or interests in notes constitutes assets of any Plan or other plan subject to
Similar Law or (2) the acquisition, holding, and disposition of the notes or interests in notes by such acquiror or
transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions or
breaches of fiduciary obligations, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring
the notes or interests in notes (and holding the notes or such interests) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan or
plan subject to Similar Law, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975
of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption or exception would be applicable
to the acquisition and holding of the notes or such interests. Investors in the notes or interests in notes have
exclusive responsibility for ensuring that none of the acquisition, holding and/or disposition of these notes or
exchange notes violates the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code and/or any Similar Laws.

This offering memorandum and the sale of notes or interests in notes to a Plan or plan subject to Similar
Law is in no respect a representation by the issuer, the initial acquirors or any other person that such an investment
meets all relevant legal requirements for Plans or such other plans generally or any particular Plan and is not a
recommendation that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS**

The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to
the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below).
This discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) and judicial decisions, each as in effect on the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change and
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change or differing interpretation could result
in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income purposes
regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision
over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (as defined in the Code) have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust, or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is not a
U.S. Holder and that is not an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This discussion is limited to persons who purchase the notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue
price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to
bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). This discussion does not address tax considerations relevant to subsequent purchasers
of notes. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a
beneficial owner in light of that beneficial owner’s particular circumstances or that may be applicable to beneficial
owners subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:

    - banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;

    - tax-exempt entities;

    - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

    - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other “flowthrough” entities and investors therein;

    - brokers or dealers in securities or currencies;

    - traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment;

    - persons required to accelerate recognition of any item of income with respect to the notes as a result of
such income being included on a applicable financial statement;

    - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

    - certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

    - holders who hold the notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, constructive sale, or
other integrated security transaction; or

-101

-----

    - holders deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

In addition, this discussion does not address U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the U.S.
federal income tax, nor does it address any aspects of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act of 2010 (including the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental
agreements entered into pursuant thereto) or U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes. Prospective investors should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. income and other tax considerations
with respect to acquiring, holding and disposing of the notes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the
tax treatment of a person treated as a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. Persons that for U.S. federal income tax purposes are treated as partnerships and
partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors.

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO
CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES. PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS SHOULD
CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE
ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP, AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND
EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

**Contingent Payment Debt Instruments**

In certain circumstances, PNG may be required to make payments in excess of stated principal and interest
on the notes (see, e.g., “Description of Notes—Events of Default”). The possibility of such payments may implicate
special rules under Treasury regulations governing “contingent payment debt instruments.” According to those
Treasury regulations, the possibility that such payments of excess amounts will be made will not affect the amount
of income a holder recognizes in advance of the payment of such excess amounts if there is only a remote chance, as
of the date the notes are issued, that such payments will be made. PNG intends to take the position that the notes
should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of the anticipated remote possibility of such
additional payments. PNG’s determination that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments, while not
binding on the IRS, is binding on holders unless they disclose their contrary position in the manner required by
applicable Treasury regulations. However, the IRS may take a position contrary to PNG’s position. If the IRS
successfully challenged PNG’s position and the notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, holders
would be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the notes’ stated interest rate, and to treat as
ordinary income rather than capital gain any gain recognized on a taxable disposition of a note. The remainder of
this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the notes of the contingent payment debt instrument
rules and the consequences thereof.

**Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the notes generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If the notes’ principal amount exceeds the issue price by at least a de minimis amount, as determined under
applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder will be required to include such excess in income as original issue
discount, as it accrues, in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest before the
receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the notes
will not be issued with original issue discount equal to or greater than the statutory de minimis amount.

-102

-----

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, redemption, or other taxable
disposition of a note equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount realized on such disposition and (2) the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. The amount realized will include the amount of any cash and the fair
market value of any other property received upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition. To
the extent that any portion of the amount realized on a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
note is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on the note, this amount generally will not be included in the
amount realized but will instead be treated in the same manner as discussed above under “—Payments of Interest” to
the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note
generally will be equal to the amount it paid for that note. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or
loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of such transaction, the U.S. Holder’s holding period
for the note exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals)
currently are eligible for reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. The deductibility of capital losses may be subject
to limitation.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Information reporting requirements generally will apply to payments of interest on the notes and to the
proceeds of a sale of a note.

A U.S. Holder generally will be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) on payments of
interest on the notes or the proceeds of a disposition of a note unless such holder is a corporation or comes within
certain other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates its exempt status, or provides a taxpayer
identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and otherwise complies with
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. Holder that does not provide PNG with its correct
taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
from a payment to a U.S. Holder may be credited against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,
or refunded, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to
them.

**Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Payments of Interest_**

In general, subject to the discussion below concerning “effectively connected” interest and backup
withholding, the gross amount of payments to a Non-U.S. Holder of interest on the notes that does not qualify for
the “portfolio interest exemption” will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless the NonU.S. Holder is eligible for an exemption from, or reduced rate of, such withholding tax under an applicable income
tax treaty and the Non-U.S. Holder provides proper certification of its eligibility for such exemption or reduced rate.
The 30% U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment to a Non-U.S. Holder of interest on the notes
under the portfolio interest exemption, provided such interest is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (or, if required by an applicable income tax treaty,
is not attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States) and the
Non-U.S. Holder (1) does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of PNG’s stock entitled to vote, (2) is not a “controlled foreign corporation” with respect to which we are a
“related person” (actually or constructively), in each case, within the meaning of the Code, and (3) either (a)
provides the Non-U.S. Holder’s name and address on a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form), and certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person,
(b) owns through a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’
securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business that certifies, under penalties of perjury, that such a form has
been received from the Non-U.S. Holder by it or by a financial institution between it and the Non-U.S. Holder or (c)

-103

-----

holds its note directly through a “qualified intermediary” (within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations)
and certain conditions are satisfied.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest paid on the note
constitutes income that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base of such Non-U.S. Holder in
the United States), such interest generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, as described above, if
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. Instead, such interest
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the U.S. federal income tax rates
applicable to U.S. citizens or domestic corporations, as applicable. Interest payments received by a Non-U.S.
Holder that is a corporation and that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business within the
United States may be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty).

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,” in general, a
Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other
disposition of the Non-U.S. Holder’s notes, unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business
carried on by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), or (ii) the
Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 or more
days in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met.

Gain described in (i) above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income tax basis at
the U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S. citizens or domestic corporations, as applicable. A Non- U.S.
Holder that is a corporation and that recognizes gain described in (i) above may also be subject to the branch profits
tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) with respect to such
effectively connected gain.

An individual Non-U.S. Holder described in (ii) above will be subject to a flat 30% tax (unless the NonU.S. Holder is eligible for a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain from such sale or other
disposition, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses, if any, of the Non-U.S. Holder, provided that the
Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

Any amounts that a Non-U.S. Holder receives on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a note that is
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest will not give rise to gain, as described above, but will instead generally be
subject to the rules for taxation of interest described above under “—Payments of Interest.”

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

PNG must report annually to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the amount of interest paid to such NonU.S. Holder and the tax withheld with respect to such interest. These reporting requirements apply regardless of
whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty.

A Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) on interest
paid with respect to such Non-U.S. Holder’s notes unless such holder certifies under penalties of perjury that, among
other things, it is a Non-U.S. Holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge, or reason to know, that such
holder is a United States person (as defined in the Code)).

Information reporting and backup withholding generally are not required with respect to any proceeds from
the sale or other disposition of a note by a Non-U.S. Holder outside of the United States through a foreign office of a
foreign broker that does not have certain specified connections to the United States. However, if a Non-U.S. Holder
sells or otherwise disposes of its notes through a U.S. broker or the U.S. offices of a foreign broker, the broker will
generally be required to report the amount of proceeds paid to the Non-U.S. Holder to the IRS and may also be

-104

-----

required to backup withhold on such proceeds unless such Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that,
among other things, it is a Non-U.S. Holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge, or reason to know, that
such holder is a United States person (as defined in the Code)). Information reporting will also apply if a Non-U.S.
Holder sells its notes through a foreign broker with certain specified connections to the United States, unless such
broker has documentary evidence in its records that such Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person and certain
other conditions are met, or such Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption (and the payor does not have
actual knowledge, or reason to know, that such holder is a United States person (as defined in the Code)).

Copies of any information returns may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which
the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder may be credited against the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, or refunded, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. NonU.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup
withholding rules to them.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

Because the following restrictions will apply to the notes, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel
prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the notes. See “Description of Notes.”

None of the notes has been registered under the Securities Act and they may not be offered or sold within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being
offered and sold only (A) to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs under Rule 144A and (B) outside the United
States to persons other than U.S. persons (“non-U.S. purchasers,” which term shall include dealers or other
professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners (other
than an estate or trust)) in compliance with Regulation S. As used herein, the terms “United States” and “U.S.
person” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

1. It is purchasing the notes for its own account or an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) a non-U.S. purchaser that is outside the United States (or a non-U.S.
purchaser that is a dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above).

offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except as set forth below.

of the notes except (A) to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a person reasonably
believed to be a QIB in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) inside the United States to institutional
“accredited investors” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) (an ‘‘Accredited
Investor”), that, prior to such transfer, furnishes (or has furnished on its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer) to the trustee
a signed letter containing certain representations and agreements relating to the restrictions on transfer of the notes
(the form of which letter can be obtained from such trustee), (D) outside the United States in compliance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act, (E) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under
the Securities Act (if available), (F) in accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act (and based upon an opinion of counsel if the Company so requests), or (G) pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act.

4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such notes.

5. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration statement) the holder of notes
or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be required to provide certifications
and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications and other
documentation as provided in the Indenture.

6. It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect unless

SECURITIES ACT), (B) IT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (C)

IT IS AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR (AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a)(1), (2), (3), OR (7) UNDER THE

YEAR AFTER THE ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF THIS SECURITY RESELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER

STATES TO AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR THAT, PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISHES (OR HAS
FURNISHED ON ITS BEHALF BY A U.S. BROKER-DEALER) TO THE TRUSTEE A SIGNED LETTER
CONTAINING CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE RESTRICTIONS
ON TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY (THE FORM OF WHICH LETTER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE
TRUSTEE FOR THIS SECURITY), (D) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION

COMPANY SO REQUESTS), OR (G) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM
THIS SECURITY IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE

COMPANY SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS EITHER OF
THEM MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS
“OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,” “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN
TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. THE ACQUIRER IS DEEMED TO
REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EITHER (1) IT IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN SUBJECT TO
TITLE I OF THE U.S. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED
(“ERISA’’) OR SECTION 4975 OF THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE
“CODE”) OR AN ENTITY THAT IS DEEMED TO HOLD THE ASSETS OF SUCH PLANS FOR PURPOSES
OF ERISA, AND NO PORTION OF THE ASSETS USED TO ACQUIRE OR HOLD THE NOTES OR ANY
INTEREST IN A NOTE CONSTITUTES ASSETS OF ANY SUCH PLAN OR OF ANY OTHER PLAN
SUBJECT TO LAWS SIMILAR TO SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (“SIMILAR
LAW”) OR (2) THE ACQUISITION, HOLDING, AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES OR ANY INTEREST IN
NOTES WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER
ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR A VIOLATION UNDER ANY APPLICABLE SIMILAR LAWS.

7. Either (1) it is not a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by it to acquire or hold the notes (or any
interest in a note) constitutes assets of any Plan or other plan subject to Similar Law or (2) its acquisition, holding,
and disposition of the notes (or such interest) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws. It
acknowledges and agrees that each transferee of the notes or an interest therein will be deemed to make the
foregoing representation and that any transfer that does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph shall be
null and void ab initio.

8. It acknowledges that the trustee will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any notes
acquired by it, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Company and the trustee that the restrictions
set forth herein have been complied with.

9. It acknowledges that the Company, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgments, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the notes are no
longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Company and the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring the notes as a
fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect

-107

to each such account and it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, and agreements
on behalf of each account.

-108

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement between us and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, as sole representative of the initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and
the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, the entire principal amount of the notes.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement are several and not joint. Those
obligations are also subject to various conditions in the purchase agreement being satisfied. The initial purchasers
have agreed to purchase all the notes if any of them are purchased. We have agreed to indemnify the several initial
purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the
initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The initial purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the notes for resale at the offering price
that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change
the offering price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their
affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The
initial purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities
Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial
purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be QIBs or pursuant to offers
and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States in compliance with Regulation S. In addition,
until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a
dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act
unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes offered by this offering memorandum, in making its purchase,
will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to
Investors.”

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer
quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a
market in the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may
discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the
trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and
liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating
performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Settlement**

It is expected that this offering will close on or about   , 2021, which will be the fifth business day
following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “or T+5”). Under Rule 15c6-1
under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties
to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is
two business days preceding the settlement date, will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in
T+5, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their
advisors.

-109

-----

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum,
without first obtaining the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, directly or indirectly, issue, sell,
offer to contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the
purchase agreement.

**Price Stabilization, Short Positions**

In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the
open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions
created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes
than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by
purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are
concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could
adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any
representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may
have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that
the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in any Member State
of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors—The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11)
of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU).

No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the United
Kingdom (the “U.K.”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”) from a
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purpose of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial
Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated
associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the U.K., or (iv) are persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may

otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as
“relevant persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or
relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering
memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Prohibition of Sales to U.K. Retail Investors—The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation.. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
“UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.
