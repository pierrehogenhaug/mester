1096_2,Offerings 2021.md,321,OFFERING MEMORANDUM SUMMARY,321.1,The Company,321.1.1,,"We are a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing properties, retail and online sports betting operations, and video gaming terminal (“VGT”) operations. Our wholly-owned interactive division, Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC (“Penn Interactive”), operates retail sports betting across the our portfolio, as well as online sports betting, online social casino, bingo and online casinos (“iGaming”). In February 2020, we acquired 36% (inclusive of 1% on a delayed basis) equity interest in Barstool Sports, Inc. (“Barstool Sports”), a leading digital sports, entertainment, lifestyle and media company, and entered into a strategic relationship with Barstool Sports, whereby Barstool Sports will exclusively promote the our land-based retail sportsbooks, iGaming products and online sports betting products, including the Barstool Sportsbook mobile app, to its national audience. We launched an online sports betting app called Barstool Sports in Pennsylvania in September 2020, in Michigan in January 2021, in Illinois in March 2021 and in Indiana in May 2021. We also operate iGaming in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Our MYCHOICE® customer loyalty program currently has over 24 million members and provides such members with various benefits, including complimentary goods and/or services. Our strategy has continued to evolve from an owner and manager of gaming and racing properties into an omni-channel provider of retail and online gaming, live racing and sports betting entertainment. We believe our continued evolution into a best-in-class omni-channel provider of retail and online gaming and sports betting entertainment will be a catalyst for our core land-based business, while also providing a platform for significant long-term shareholder value. As of March 31, 2021, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in 41 properties in 19 states. The majority of the real estate assets (i.e., land and buildings) used in our operations are subject to triple net master leases; the most significant of which are the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease (as such terms are defined in the section entitled “Offering Memorandum Summary—The Company—Triple Net Leases” and collectively referred to as the “Master Leases”), with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ: GLPI) (“GLPI”), a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). In addition, we are currently developing two Category 4 satellite gaming casinos in Pennsylvania: Hollywood Casino York and Hollywood Casino Morgantown, both of which are expected to commence operations by the end of 2021. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (known as “COVID19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic. To help combat the spread of COVID-19 and pursuant to various orders from state gaming regulatory bodies or governmental authorities, operations at all of our properties were temporarily suspended for single or multiple time periods during the year. Once re-opened, properties operated with reduced gaming and hotel capacity and limited food and beverage offerings in order to accommodate social distancing and health and safety protocols. During the fourth quarter of 2020, our properties temporarily suspended operations in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois and were subject to increased operational restrictions in Ohio and Massachusetts (among other states). Our Michigan property temporarily closed on November 17, 2020 and reopened on December 23, 2020. Our Pennsylvania properties temporarily closed on December 12, 2020 and reopened on January 4, 2021. Our Illinois properties temporarily closed on November 20, 2020 and began reopening with limited hours of operations beginning January 16, 2021 and throughout the week. The property closures were pursuant to the various orders ----- from state gaming regulatory bodies or governmental authorities to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19. As of the date of this offering memorandum, with the exception of Valley Race Park, all of our properties have reopened. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to our business and had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During the year, substantial measures were taken to improve our financial position and liquidity as discussed in our Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1, “Organization and Basis of Presentation” in the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. In February 2020, we closed on our investment in Barstool Sports pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with Barstool Sports and stockholders of Barstool Sports, in which we purchased approximately 36% of the common stock of Barstool Sports for a purchase price of $161.2 million. Within three years after the closing or earlier at our election, we will increase our ownership in Barstool Sports to approximately 50% with an incremental investment of approximately $62 million, consistent with the implied valuation at the time of the initial investment. With respect to the remaining Barstool Sports shares, we have immediately exercisable call rights, and the existing Barstool Sports stockholders have put rights exercisable beginning three years after closing, all based on a fair market value calculation at the time of exercise (subject to a cap of $650.0 million and a floor of 2.25 times the annualized revenue of Barstool Sports, all subject to various adjustments). Upon closing, we became Barstool Sports’ exclusive gaming partner for up to 40 years and have the sole right to utilize the Barstool Sports brand for all of our online and retail sports betting and iGaming products. For additional information, see Note 7, “Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates” in the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. On December 15, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with GLPI to purchase the operations of Hollywood Casino Perryville for $31.1 million. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2021, however there is no guarantee that this transaction will close within this time frame, or at all. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, we would lease the real estate assets associated with Hollywood Casino Perryville from GLPI with initial annual rent of $7.8 million per year subject to escalation. For additional information on our acquisitions, see Note 6, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. In May 2019, we acquired Greektown Casino-Hotel (“Greektown”) in Detroit, Michigan, subject to a triple net lease with VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE: VICI) (“VICI”, a REIT and collectively with GLPI, our “REIT Landlords”) (the “Greektown Lease”) and, in January 2019, we acquired Margaritaville Casino Resort (“Margaritaville”) in Bossier City, Louisiana, subject to a triple net lease with VICI (the “Margaritaville Lease” and collectively with the Master Leases, the Greektown Lease, the Meadows Lease, the Tropicana Lease and the Morgantown Lease, of which the Meadows Lease, the Tropicana Lease and Morgantown Lease are defined in the section entitled “Offering Memorandum Summary—The Company—Triple Net Leases,” the “Triple Net Leases”). In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (“Pinnacle”), a leading regional gaming operator (the “Pinnacle Acquisition”). In connection with the Pinnacle Acquisition, we added 12 gaming properties to our portfolio, providing us with greater operational scale and geographic diversity. We assumed the Pinnacle Master Lease concurrently with the closing of the Pinnacle Acquisition. We believe that our portfolio of assets provides us the benefit of geographically-diversified cash flow from operations. We expect to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and investments, and the development of new gaming properties. In addition, the partnership with Barstool Sports reflects our strategy to continue evolving from the nation’s largest regional gaming operator to a best-in-class omnichannel provider of retail and online gaming and sports betting entertainment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

In addition to the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease, five individual gaming facilities used in our operations are subject to individual triple net leases. Under triple net ----- leases, in addition to lease payments for the real estate assets, the Company is required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); (4) all tenant capital improvements; and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. The following summaries of the Master Leases are qualified in their entirety by reference to either the Penn Master Lease or the Pinnacle Master Lease, as applicable, all of which are incorporated by reference in the exhibits to the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. _Penn Master Lease and Pinnacle Master Lease_ Pursuant to a triple net master lease with GLPI (the “Penn Master Lease”), which became effective November 1, 2013, we lease real estate assets associated with 19 of the gaming facilities used in our operations. The Penn Master Lease has an initial term of 15 years with four subsequent, five-year renewal periods on the same terms and conditions, exercisable at our option. If we elect to renew the term of the Penn Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all of the leased real estate assets then subject to the Penn Master Lease, subject to limitations on the final renewal term with respect to certain of the barge-based facilities. In connection with the Pinnacle Acquisition, we assumed a triple net master lease with GLPI (the “Pinnacle Master Lease”), originally effective April 28, 2016. Pursuant to the Pinnacle Master Lease, we lease real estate assets associated with 12 of the gaming facilities used in our operations from GLPI. Upon assumption of the Pinnacle Master Lease, as amended, there were 7.5 years remaining of the initial ten-year term, with five subsequent, five-year renewal periods exercisable at our option. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Pinnacle Acquisition, GLPI acquired the real estate assets associated with Plainridge Park Casino and leased back such assets to us pursuant to an amendment to the Pinnacle Master Lease. Pursuant to a binding term sheet between the Company and GLPI entered into on March 27, 2020, we agreed that, in the future, we would exercise the next scheduled five-year renewal under the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease. GLPI agreed they would grant us the option to exercise an additional five-year renewal term at the end of the lease term on the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease, subject to certain conditions. In the future, upon exercising each of these renewal options, the term of the Penn Master Lease would extend to November 30, 2033 and the term of the Pinnacle Master Lease would extend to April 30, 2031. If all renewal options contained within the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease were exercised, inclusive of these renewal options, the term of the Penn Master Lease would extend to November 30, 2053 and the term of the Pinnacle Master Lease would extend to April 30, 2056. _Morgantown Lease_ On October 1, 2020, we sold the land underlying our Morgantown development project to GLPI in exchange for rent credits of $30.0 million.

The notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all secured indebtedness of PNG, including indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The notes will not be guaranteed by any of PNG’s subsidiaries and will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any subsidiary of PNG. As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to the issuance of the notes, PNG and its subsidiaries would have had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $2,768.6 million, including $400.0 million representing the notes offered hereby and approximately $1,612.0 million of secured indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement (excluding amounts under outstanding letters of credit) and an additional $672.0 million of borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement. Since none of PNG’s subsidiaries will guarantee the notes offered hereby, creditors of PNG’s subsidiaries (including lenders under our the Secured Credit Facilities (as defined in this offering memorandum) in the case of subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Secured Credit Facilities) have a prior claim, ahead of the holders of the notes, on the assets of those subsidiaries. The liabilities of PNG’s subsidiaries also include payables, deferred taxes, intercompany debt and other ordinary course liabilities. As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, PNG’s subsidiaries would have had total indebtedness (including guarantees under the Credit Agreement) of approximately $1,612.0 million. ----- Guarantees ............................................................** The notes will not be guaranteed on the issue date. Following the issue date, certain of PNG’s subsidiaries may be required to guarantee the notes if such subsidiaries guarantee certain other debt securities of PNG. Optional Redemption ...........................................** At any time prior to      , 2024 PNG may redeem the notes for cash at its option, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole premium”, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

During the first quarter of 2020, we identified an indicator of impairment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused all of our gaming properties to temporarily close. At the time of the interim impairment assessment, we revised our cash flow projections to reflect the current economic environment, including the uncertainty of the nature, timing and extent of reopening our gaming properties. Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million resulting from an impairment analysis of the long-lived assets at the Tropicana Las Vegas and an impairment charge of $4.6 million on our investment in the Texas joint ventures with MAXXAM. (2) Includes the full year impact of the Pinnacle Acquisition and the acquisitions of Margaritaville in January 2019 and Greektown in May 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment losses on our goodwill and other intangible assets of $170.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense associated with the Penn Master Lease decreased by $181.2 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 842 (as defined in footnote (5) below), interest expense associated with the Pinnacle Master Lease increased by $126.0 million, and interest expense incurred on long-term debt increased by $50.8 million. (3) Includes the impact of the acquisition of Pinnacle in October 2018. In addition, we incurred $95.0 million in costs, primarily associated with the Pinnacle Acquisition, a $21.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, and a $34.3 million long-lived asset impairment charge. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $63.0 million of interest expense associated with the Pinnacle Master Lease. (4) In addition to GAAP financial measures, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR margin as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is not calculated in ----- the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure of comparing performance among different companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; debt extinguishment and financing charges; impairment losses; insurance recoveries, net of deductible charges; changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations; gain or loss on disposal of assets; the difference between budget and actual expense for cash-settled stock-based awards; pre-opening and acquisition costs; and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with our share of non-operating items (such as interest expense, net; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation expense) added back for Barstool Sports and our Kansas Entertainment joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA is inclusive of rent expense associated with our triple net operating leases (the operating lease components contained within the Penn Master Lease and Pinnacle Master Lease (primarily land), the Meadows Lease, the Margaritaville Lease, the Greektown Lease and the Tropicana Lease). Although Adjusted EBITDA includes rent expense associated with our triple net operating leases, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our consolidated results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business, and is especially relevant in evaluating large, long-lived casino-hotel projects because it provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors and creditors as an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations, including our ability to service debt, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their Adjusted EBITDA calculations of certain corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented as a supplemental disclosure, as management believes that it is a commonly used measure of performance in the gaming industry and that it is considered by many to be a key indicator of the Company’s operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) plus rent expense associated with triple net operating leases (which is a normal, recurring cash operating expense necessary to operate our business). Adjusted EBITDAR is presented on a consolidated basis outside the financial statements solely as a valuation metric. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR is an additional metric traditionally used by analysts in valuing gaming companies subject to triple net leases since it eliminates the effects of variability in leasing methods and capital structures. This metric is included as supplemental disclosure because (i) we believe Adjusted EBITDAR is traditionally used by gaming operator analysts and investors to determine the equity value of gaming operators and (ii) Adjusted EBITDAR is one of the metrics used by other financial analysts in valuing our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDAR is useful for equity valuation purposes because (i) its calculation isolates the effects of financing real estate; and (ii) using a multiple of Adjusted EBITDAR to calculate enterprise value allows for an adjustment to the balance sheet to recognize estimated liabilities arising from operating leases related to real estate. However, Adjusted EBITDAR when presented on a consolidated basis, is not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance or considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because it excludes the rent expense associated with our triple net operating leases and is provided for the limited purposes referenced herein. Adjusted EBITDAR margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDAR on a consolidated basis (as defined above) divided by revenues on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDAR margin is presented on a consolidated basis outside the financial statements solely as a valuation metric. (5) On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”), using a modified retrospective approach, which did not require that prior years presented be restated. Upon adoption of ASC 842, among other items, we reduced property and equipment, net, by $1,571.7 million, recorded right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $4,030.8 million, reduced the financing obligations by $2,954.1 million, and a recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of $1,085.7 million. (6) Total debt represents the sum of total long-term debt (net of current maturities and debt issuance costs) plus current maturities of long-term debt. ----- The following table includes a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is determined in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP financial measures.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

In addition, we are required to make significant annual lease payments to our REIT Landlords pursuant to the Triple Net Leases, which we currently expect will be approximately $839.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and significant fixed annual lease payments under the Triple Net Leases. Our substantial indebtedness and additional fixed costs under our Lease obligations could have important consequences to our financial health. As noted above, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our gaming properties had been temporarily closed. The closure of our gaming properties had significantly disrupted our ability to generate revenues. In order to remain in compliance with PNG’s debt covenants and meet PNG’s payment obligations, on April 14, 2020, PNG and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an agreement to amend PNG’s existing credit agreement to provide temporary relief from PNG’s financial covenants. In addition, our substantial indebtedness could result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

In addition, our existing indebtedness contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the ‘‘FCA’’), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). In March 2021, the FCA announced that the majority of LIBOR settings would cease after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR settings would cease after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed, has identified the Secured Oversight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for USD LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as SOFR, or any other reference rate, will have on us or PNG’s revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

We also may incur indebtedness related to properties we develop or acquire in the future prior to generating cash flow from those properties. If those properties do not provide us with cash flow to service that indebtedness (including as a result of COVID-19), we will need to rely on cash flow from our other properties, which would increase our leverage.

Since none of PNG’s subsidiaries will guarantee the notes offered hereby, creditors of PNG’s subsidiaries (including lenders under our the Secured Credit Facilities in the case of subsidiaries that are guarantors of the -22 ----- Secured Credit Facilities) have a prior claim, ahead of the holders of the notes, on the assets of those subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, PNG’s subsidiaries would have had total indebtedness (including guarantees under the Credit Agreement) of approximately $1,612.0 million. The liabilities of PNG’s subsidiaries also include payables, deferred taxes, intercompany debt and other ordinary course liabilities. In addition, PNG’s subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up of any of PNG’s subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness and trade creditors of PNG’s subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of PNG’s subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to PNG. Accordingly, there may be insufficient funds to satisfy claims of noteholders. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing current and future indebtedness of PNG’s subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may further limit our ability to obtain cash from PNG’s subsidiaries. In addition, the earnings of PNG’s subsidiaries, covenants contained in PNG’s and PNG’s subsidiaries’ debt agreements (including the Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes Indenture (as defined in the Description of Notes) and the indenture), covenants contained in other agreements to which PNG or PNG’s subsidiaries are or may become subject, business and tax considerations, and applicable law, including laws regarding the payment of dividends and distributions, may further restrict the ability of PNG’s subsidiaries to make distributions to PNG.

For example, the provisions contained or to be contained in the agreements relating to PNG’s indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, limit but do not prohibit PNG’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness senior to or pari passu with the notes, and the amount of indebtedness that PNG and its subsidiaries could incur could be substantial and could be used to finance acquisitions or to assume debt in connection with an acquisition. Accordingly, PNG or its subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including additional indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and additional senior notes. Much of this additional indebtedness could constitute secured or senior indebtedness. In addition, any of PNG’s or its subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness could be guaranteed in the future by PNG’s subsidiaries or could be further secured. If PNG incurs any secured indebtedness, the holders of that secured indebtedness will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets securing that indebtedness before any payment may be made with respect to the notes. If PNG incurs any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes offered hereby, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of these notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceedings. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you.

A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued (or, in the case of global notes, a book-entry position made) in the name of the Holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption (subject to satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent). Unless we default in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of them called for redemption. Subject to applicable securities laws, Penn National or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time acquire notes or other Indebtedness. Any such acquisition may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as Penn National or any such affiliates may determine.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

In the Change of Control Offer, Penn National will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, Penn National will mail (or in the case of global notes, give pursuant to applicable DTC procedures) a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions -32 ----- that constitute, or are expected to constitute, the Change of Control Triggering Event, and offering to repurchase notes on the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 15 days and no later than 60 days after the date such notice is mailed (or in the case of global notes, given pursuant to applicable DTC procedures), pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. Except with respect to the last sentence of the fourth succeeding paragraph, Penn National will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, Penn National will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict. On the Change of Control Payment Date, Penn National will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent no later than 11:00 a.m. New York City time an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes accepted for payment; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee (if not previously delivered by the holders of the notes or otherwise) the notes accepted for payment together with an officer’s certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by Penn National. The paying agent will promptly pay to each Holder of notes accepted for payment the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new note will be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Penn National will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by Penn National and purchases all notes properly tendered and not validly withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of an anticipated Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. If such a conditional Change of Control Offer is made, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in Penn National’s sole discretion, until such time as such Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, or if such Change of Control Triggering Event shall not have occurred by the applicable Change of Control Payment Date (whether the original Change of Control Payment Date or the Change of Control Payment Date so delayed) or if in Penn National’s discretion if in its good faith judgement any or all of the conditions will not be satisfied, then such Change of Control Offer may be rescinded by Penn National. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in any tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer and Penn National, or any third party making such tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer in lieu of Penn National, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, Penn National or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer, to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to Holders in such tender offer, Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Penn National and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a -33 ----- Holder of notes to require Penn National to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Penn National and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole may be uncertain. The Credit Agreement and the Master Lease each provide, that certain change of control events with respect to Penn National would constitute a default under the Credit Agreement or the Master Lease, respectively. Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which Penn National becomes a party may contain similar provisions. In the event a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs at a time when Penn National is prohibited from purchasing notes by the terms of existing agreements, including Indebtedness, Penn National could seek the consent of its lenders or other counterparties to the purchase of notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings, as applicable, that contain such prohibition. If Penn National does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, as applicable, Penn National will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In such case, Penn National’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute a default under the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness. _Asset Sales_ Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless: (1) Penn National (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) at least 75% of the consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received in the Asset Sale by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of (x) cash or Cash Equivalents or (y) Permitted Business Assets; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (2), each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities, as shown on Penn National’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto), of Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities of Penn National that are by their terms subordinated to the notes) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (including in the case of a sale of a Subsidiary, Indebtedness of such Subsidiary so long as Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not guarantors of or co-obligors on such Indebtedness following such Asset Sale); (b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that within 270 days after the consummation of such Asset Sale, subject to ordinary settlement periods, are converted by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; and (c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at the time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $250.0 million and 25% of Consolidated Cash Flow for the Applicable Measurement Period at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply an amount equal to those Net Proceeds at its option: -34 ----- (1) to repay Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (or other Indebtedness of Penn National secured by a Lien) or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary; (2) (x) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase notes, including (I) as provided under “—Optional Redemption,” (II) by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Note Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of such purchase or (III) through open market purchases; or (y) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Indebtedness that ranks equally in right of payment with the notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of such prepayment, repayment, redemption or purchase; _provided further that, to the extent Penn National or such Restricted Subsidiary redeems, repays or_ repurchases Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (y), Penn National shall equally and ratably reduce (or offer to reduce) obligations under the notes as provided in the immediately preceding clause (x); (3) to improve real property or make capital expenditures; (4) to invest in or acquire Permitted Business Assets; (5) to enter into binding commitment to take any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (1) through (4), and take such action within 12 months after the end of such 450 day period; or (6) any combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (5). Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, Penn National may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest or utilize the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds in any fiscal year exceeds $150 million, Penn National will make either the offers set forth in clause (a) or the offer set forth in clause (b), the choice of offer to be determined by Penn National in its sole discretion: (a) Penn National will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of notes (the “Note Asset _Sale Offer”), and an offer to all holders of any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (the “Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer”) containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect_ to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets (to the extent required pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), to purchase, on a pro rata basis (with Excess Proceeds prorated between the Holders of notes and such holders of Pari Passu Indebtedness based upon the respective outstanding aggregate principal amounts (or accreted value, as applicable) on the date the Note Asset Sale Offer and the Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, are made), the maximum principal amount of the notes and the maximum principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the respective pro rata amounts of Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of notes or the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into the Note Asset Sale Offer and the Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, is less than the principal amount of notes or the principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Pari Passu Indebtedness offered to be purchased in the Note Asset Sale Offer or the Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use those remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. (b) Penn National will make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders of notes and all holders of other Pari _Passu Indebtedness containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect_ to offers to purchase or redeem or repay with the proceeds of sales of assets (to the extent -35 ----- required pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of such Asset Sale Offer, Penn National may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If, in the case of clause (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of notes or the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Note Asset Sale Offer or Pari Passu Asset Sale Offer, respectively, exceeds the respective pro rata amounts of Excess Proceeds, or, in the case of clause (b), the aggregate principal amount of notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes to be repurchased shall be selected in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed or, if the notes are not listed but are in global form, then by lot or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or, if the notes are not listed and not in global form on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the trustee will deem to be fair and appropriate, and Penn National shall select Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro _rata basis on the basis of the aggregate accreted value or principal amount of tendered notes and Pari Passu_ Indebtedness. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the “Asset Sale Payment Date”), and will be payable in cash. After the completion of any Asset Sale, Penn National may make an Asset Sale Offer prior to the time it is required to do so hereunder. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds in any fiscal year will be reset at zero. If any non-cash consideration received by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in connection with any Asset Sale is converted into or sold or otherwise disposed of for cash (other than interest received with respect to any such non-cash consideration), then such conversion or disposition, at the time of such conversion or disposition, shall be subject to the provisions of this covenant (subject to the proviso of the definition of “Asset Sale”). Penn National will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, Penn National will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict. The Credit Agreement contains restrictions on Penn National’s ability to purchase notes with Asset Sale proceeds. Any future credit agreements or other agreements may contain similar restrictions. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when Penn National is prohibited from purchasing notes, Penn National could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Penn National does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, Penn National will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In such case, Penn National’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute a default under the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

If on any date following the Issue Date: (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture, then beginning on that date and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent changes in the ratings of the notes or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, Penn National and its Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following provisions of the indenture (collectively, the “Terminated Covenants” and, such event, the “Covenant Termination Event”): -36 ----- (a) “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments”; (b) “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”; (c) “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”; (d) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”; (e) “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates”; and (f) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” Upon and following a Covenant Termination Event, no Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to have occurred or exist under the indenture or the notes with respect to the Terminated Covenants based on, and none of Penn National or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or failed to be taken, or any events occurring, upon and following a Covenant Termination Event, regardless of whether such actions, failure to act or event would have been permitted if the applicable Terminated Covenants remained in effect. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain any Investment Grade Rating. _Certain Determinations_ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of any covenant that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the “Fixed Amounts”) substantially concurrently or in a series of related transactions with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision in such covenant that requires compliance with any such financial ratio or test (any such amounts, the “Incurrence Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts (and any cash proceeds thereof) in such covenant shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence Based Amounts in such covenant in connection with such incurrence, but full pro forma effect shall be given to all applicable and related transactions (including the use of proceeds of all Indebtedness to be incurred and any repayments, repurchases and redemptions of Indebtedness) and all other permitted pro forma adjustments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time any applicable ratio or financial test for any category based on an Incurrence Based Amount permits Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments, Asset Sales, sale and leaseback transactions and Investments, as applicable, previously incurred under a category based on a Fixed Amount, such Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments, Asset Sales, sale and leaseback transactions and Investments, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been automatically reclassified as incurred under such category based on an Incurrence Based Amount. Penn National may elect, pursuant to an officer’s certificate delivered to the Trustee to treat all or any portion of any revolving commitment or undrawn commitment under any Indebtedness as being incurred and outstanding at such time and for so long as such commitments remain outstanding (regardless of whether then drawn), in which case any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence at such subsequent time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for all purposes hereof, (a) the Master Leases and any Gaming Lease (and any Guarantee of the foregoing) shall not constitute Indebtedness, Liens or a Capital Lease Obligation regardless of how such Master Lease or Gaming Lease may be treated under GAAP, (b) any interest portion of payments in connection with such Master Lease or Gaming Lease shall not constitute consolidated interest expense (or terms of similar effect) and (c) Consolidated Cash Flow and Consolidated Net Income (and terms of similar effect) shall be calculated by deducting, without duplication of amounts otherwise deducted, rent, insurance, property taxes and other amounts and expenses actually paid in cash under the Master Leases or any -37 ----- Gaming Lease in the applicable period and no deductions in calculating Consolidated Cash Flow or Consolidated Net Income (and terms of similar effect) shall occur as a result of imputed interest, amounts under the Master Leases or any Gaming Lease not paid in cash during the relevant period or other non-cash amounts incurred in respect of the Master Leases or any Gaming Lease; provided that any “true-up” of rent paid in cash pursuant to the Master Leases or any Gaming Lease shall be accounted for in the fiscal quarter to which such payment relates as if such payment were originally made in such fiscal quarter. _Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions_ When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the indenture or compliance with any provision of the indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, dividends and dispositions or distributions), in each case, at the option of Penn National (Penn National’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) that the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable notice, declaration of a dividend or distribution or similar event), (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer is published on a regulatory information service in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction is made (or that equivalent notice under equivalent laws, rules or regulations in such other applicable jurisdiction is made), (c) that notice is given with respect to any redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock requiring irrevocable notice in advance of such redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment or (d) that notice is given with respect to any dividend or other distribution requiring irrevocable notice in advance thereof and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, dividends or other distributions and dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, Penn National or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Liens, for example, whether such Liens are to secure Indebtedness that is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, Penn National may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets and (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, dividends or distributions and dispositions). For the avoidance of doubt, if Penn National has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated Cash Flow of Penn National or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the -38 ----- availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction. _Restricted Payments_ Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (A) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on account of Penn National’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (other than (x) dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Penn National or (y) to Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National); (B) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (x) any Equity Interests of Penn National (other than Disqualified Stock within 365 days of the Stated Maturity of such Disqualified Stock) or (y) any preferred stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National (other than within 365 days of the Stated Maturity thereof), in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), other than any such Equity Interests or preferred stock held by Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National; (C) make any payment of principal on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Indebtedness of Penn National that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes (except a payment within 365 days of the Stated Maturity thereof and other than Indebtedness permitted under clause (6) of the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”); or (D) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (A) through (D) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment: (1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment; (2) Penn National would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto and to any related transactions as if such Restricted Payment and related transactions had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the 5.875% Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph (other than clause (1) thereof)), is less than the sum, without duplication, of: (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of Penn National for the period (taken as one accounting period) from January 1, 2014 to the end of Penn National’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus -39 ----- (b) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and Cash Equivalents and the Fair Market Value of assets or consideration other than cash or Cash Equivalents, received by Penn National since the 5.875% Issue Date (i) as a contribution to its common equity capital, or (ii) from or in exchange for the issue or sale of Equity Interests of Penn National (other than Disqualified Stock), or (iii) from or in exchange for the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of Penn National, in each case in this clause (iii), that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of Penn National), plus (c) to the extent that any Restricted Investment (including to designate a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that was made after the 5.875% Issue Date and was included in the calculation of Restricted Payments made under the indenture: (x) is sold for cash or Cash Equivalents or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash or Cash Equivalents, in whole or in part (including through the sale of capital stock or other securities of an Unrestricted Subsidiary other than to Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), or (y) is repurchased or redeemed by any person (other than Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or results in, or is otherwise returned or reduced by, the payment of principal, interest, dividends or distributions, or repayments of loans or advances, or other transfers of assets, or the satisfaction, release, expiration, cancellation or reduction (other than by means of payments by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Indebtedness or other obligations (including any such Indebtedness or other obligations guaranteed by Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Investment Guarantee or reductions in liabilities under Guarantees), or any payments under management contracts or services agreements, in each case, 100% of the aggregate reduction of or return with respect to, and all other payments, and the Fair Market Value of assets other than cash, received with respect to, such Restricted Investment, plus (d) to the extent that any Restricted Investment was made after the 5.875% Issue Date in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (other than through the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to which clause (e) below shall apply) or is merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or into, or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is liquidated into, Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary, and such Restricted Investment remains outstanding, the aggregate amount of such Restricted Investment, plus (e) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Penn National is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the covenant “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” or has been merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or into, or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is liquidated into, Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case after the 5.875% Issue Date, the Fair Market Value of Penn National’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Investment in such Subsidiary (directly or indirectly) as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, transfer or conveyance or liquidation. The preceding provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or distribution or giving of the redemption notice, as applicable, if at the date of declaration or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, the dividend, distribution or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of the indenture;

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (24) above or is entitled to be incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Penn National will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock on the date of its incurrence or issuance in any manner that complies with this covenant. In addition, Penn National may, at any time, change the classification of an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (or any portion thereof) to any other clause or to the first paragraph of this covenant, provided that Penn National or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary would be permitted to incur or issue such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (or portion thereof) pursuant to such other clause or the first paragraph of this covenant, as the case may be, at such time of reclassification. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”. In connection with the incurrence or issuance, as applicable, of (x) revolving loan Indebtedness under this covenant or (y) any commitment relating to the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under this covenant and the granting of any Lien to secure any such Indebtedness, Penn National or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such incurrence or issuance and the granting of any such Lien as having occurred on the date of first incurrence or issuance of such revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment (such date, the “Deemed Date”), and any related subsequent actual incurrence or issuance or granting of any such Lien therefor will be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been incurred or issued and granted on such Deemed Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio and usage of any other baskets or ratios under the indenture (as applicable). -47 ----- Accrual of interest, the accrual or accumulation of dividends, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock for purposes of this covenant. The maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur or issue shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, due solely to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount or liquidation value of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock was incurred or issued, in the case of term debt, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is incurred or issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation value of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock in the applicable currency does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation value of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced in the applicable currency (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness, all accrued or accumulated dividends on the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the amount of all prepayment penalties, fees, costs, expenses, discounts and premiums incurred in connection therewith and any original issue discount in connection therewith). The principal amount of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock incurred or issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, if incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. A change in GAAP that results in an obligation existing at the time of such change, not previously classified as Indebtedness, becoming Indebtedness, or that results in a liability for all or part of such obligation having to be recognized, will not be deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of, which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. _Guarantees of Debt Securities_ Following the date of the indenture, no Restricted Subsidiary of Penn National will directly or indirectly guarantee, or become jointly and severally liable with respect to, any Debt Securities of Penn National (excluding, in any event, (x) Acquired Debt and (y) guarantees of such Acquired Debt or any other Indebtedness of Penn National to the extent a guarantee is required as a result of the assumption by Penn National of such Acquired Debt described in clause (x) pursuant to the terms thereof as they existed at the time of and after giving effect to (and are not modified in contemplation of, other than to give effect to) the assumption of or acquisition of such Acquired Debt) issued after the date of the indenture, unless a guarantee is provided in respect of the notes by such Restricted Subsidiary. _Liens_ Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), unless all payments due under the indenture and the notes are secured (1) on an equal and ratable basis with, or on a senior basis to, the obligations so secured (if such obligations rank equally in right of payment with the notes) until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien or (2) on a senior basis to the obligations so secured to the extent such obligations are subordinated in right of payment to the notes. Any Lien created for the benefit of the -48 ----- Holders of the notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Penn National may, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if incurred or issued at such later time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the time of incurrence, issuance, classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be treated as being incurred, issued or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof without giving pro forma effect to such item (or portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness that may be incurred or issued pursuant to any other clause or paragraph (or portion thereof) at such time. In addition, with respect to any revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment relating to the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness that is designated to be incurred or issued on any date pursuant to the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” any Lien that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also be designated by Penn National or any Restricted Subsidiary to be incurred on such date and, in such event, any related subsequent actual incurrence of such Lien shall be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to be incurred on such prior date, including for purposes of calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien.” With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the incurrence or issuance of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness that is not deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.” _Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_ Penn National will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or pay any indebtedness owed to Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (b) make loans or advances to Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (c) transfer any of its properties or assets to Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

(10) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, in the good faith judgment of Penn National, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced;

Nothing contained in this covenant shall prevent Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from (1) creating, incurring, assuming or suffering to exist any Liens otherwise permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Liens” or (2) restricting the sale or other disposition of property or assets of Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that secure Indebtedness of Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries. _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_ Penn National may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not Penn National is the surviving entity); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person unless: (1) either (a) Penn National is the surviving entity; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Penn National) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is a company, partnership, corporation, trust or limited liability company or other business entity organized or existing under the laws of Ireland, England and Wales, Luxembourg or the United States, any state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory of the United States; (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Penn National) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of Penn National under the notes and the indenture; (3) immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and (4) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and to any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, (a) Penn National or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Penn National), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made, would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” or (b) Penn National (or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Penn National) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction.

(8) the occurrence of a Trigger Event and the transactions contemplated by each applicable Trust Agreement; (9) transactions with persons who have entered into an agreement, contract or arrangement with Penn National or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to manage, own or operate a Gaming Facility because Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries have not received the requisite Gaming Approvals or are otherwise not permitted to manage, own or operate such Gaming Facility under applicable Gaming Laws; provided that such transactions shall have been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of Penn National’s Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the Board of Directors consisting of disinterested members of the Board of Directors) and determined by them to be in the best interests of Penn National; (10) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, contractors, landlords, lessors, lessees, licensors, licensees, joint venture or development partners or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture which are fair to Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in the determination of Penn National’s Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the Board of Directors) or management, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; (11) transactions with joint ventures and Subsidiaries thereof and Unrestricted Subsidiaries relating to the provision of management services, overhead, sharing of customer lists and customer loyalty programs or that are approved by a majority of the disinterested members of Penn National’s Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the Board of Directors consisting of disinterested members of the Board of Directors) (a director shall be disinterested if he or she has no interest in such joint venture or Unrestricted Subsidiary other than through Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided that no Affiliate of Penn National (other than Penn National’s Restricted Subsidiaries) has an interest (other than indirectly through Penn National and other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries or such joint ventures) in any such joint venture or Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(13) transactions between Penn National or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person, which is an Affiliate solely due to a director or directors of such Person (or a parent company of such Person) also being a director of Penn National; provided, however, that any such director abstains from voting as a director of Penn National on any matter involving such other Person; (14) transactions with a Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of such transaction that becomes an Affiliate as a result of such transaction; and -54 ----- (15) the GLPI and VICI Agreements and any agreements of similar type with any other lessor (or affiliate of such lessor) and any agreements with respect to a Social Gaming Disposition Transaction and, in each case, any actions or transactions pursuant thereto or contemplated thereby. _Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_ Each of the Existing Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as of the date of the indenture. Further, the Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the designation of the Existing Unrestricted Subsidiaries as such on the Issue Date), the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Penn National and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will constitute Restricted Investments under the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or, if eligible, Permitted Investments, as determined by Penn National. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default. _Master Lease_ Neither Penn National nor Tenant will enter into any amendment to the Master Lease if such amendment would materially impair the ability of Penn National to satisfy its obligations to make payments on the notes. Tenant shall not transfer its rights or obligations under the Master Lease to any Person other than to Penn National or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that no such transfer shall be permitted hereunder unless expressly permitted under the Master Lease or consented to in writing by Landlord. _Reports_ So long as the notes are outstanding, Penn National will deliver to the trustee within 30 days after the filing of the same with the Commission, copies of the quarterly and annual reports of Penn National and of the information, documents and other reports, if any, which Penn National is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding that Penn National may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, so long as the notes are outstanding, Penn National will file with the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports of the Issuer which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed in such rules and regulations. The availability of the foregoing materials on the Commission’s EDGAR service (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to satisfy Penn National’s obligations to furnish such materials to the trustee and to the Holders of notes, upon Holder request; provided, _however, that the trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information,_ documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR service (or its successor). In the event that: (1) the rules and regulations of the Commission permit the Penn National and any direct or indirect parent of Penn National to report at such parent entity’s level on a consolidated basis or (2) any direct or indirect parent of Penn National is or becomes a guarantor of the notes, then in each case consolidated reporting at such parent entity’s level in a manner consistent with that described under the requirements set forth above under “—Reports” for Penn National will satisfy such requirements, and Penn National is permitted to satisfy its obligations under “—Reports” with respect to financial information relating to Penn National by furnishing financial information relating to such direct or indirect parent; provided that in the case of clauses (1) and (2) above such financial information is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such direct or indirect parent and any of its Subsidiaries other than Penn National and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to Penn National and its Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand within 15 Business Days of furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph. -55 ----- Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the trustee is for informational purposes only and the trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive or actual notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including Penn National’s compliance with any of its covenants under the indenture (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on officer’s certificates). The trustee shall have no responsibility for the filing, timeliness or content of any reports, information or documents. The trustee shall have no obligation to determine whether or not such reports, information or documents have been filed pursuant to the SEC’s EDGAR filing system (or its successor) or postings to any website have occurred, and the trustee shall have no duty to participate in or monitor any conference calls. In addition, Penn National has agreed that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, if Penn National is not required to file with the Commission the reports required by the first paragraph of this covenant, it will furnish to the Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may occur with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to the date of such declaration.

In the event that the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes deliver to the trustee a notice of a Default or an Event of Default or an acceleration, such Holders also shall deliver a copy of such notice to the Landlord. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if a responsible officer of the trustee has received written notice of such Default or Event of Default, the trustee shall mail to Holders of notes a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after a responsible officer of the trustee has received notice of such Default or Event of Default.

If the failure to comply by Penn National with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports” shall not have been cured or waived on or before the 121st day following Penn National’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice, then the failure to comply by Penn National with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports” shall on such 121st day constitute an Event of Default. A failure to comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Reports” automatically shall cease to be continuing and shall be deemed cured at such time as Penn National furnishes to the trustee the applicable information or report (it being understood that the availability of such information or report on the Commission’s EDGAR service (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to satisfy Penn National’s obligation to furnish such information or report to the trustee); provided, however, that the trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR service (or its successor). Any notice of Default, notice of a continuing Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of a continuing Event of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action relating to a Default or Event of Default other than a bankruptcy default (a “Noteholder Direction”) with respect to the notes provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a separate written representation from each such Holder delivered to Penn National and the trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Default or Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide Penn National with such other information as Penn National may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any clearinghouse or any other depositary, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by DTC or its nominee, such clearinghouse or such other depositary or by the beneficial owner of an interest in the notes after delivery to the trustee of the evidence of beneficial ownership satisfactory to the trustee. -58 ----- If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, Penn National determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the trustee an officer’s certificate stating that Penn National has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, Penn National provides to the trustee an officer’s certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the trustee which obligations shall continue to survive), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration shall be voided and the trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, the trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The trustee shall have no liability to Penn National, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. With their acquisition of the notes, each Holder consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the trustee to Penn National in accordance with the terms of the indenture. Each Holder of the notes waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the trustee in respect of, and agrees that the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes in accordance with the foregoing three paragraphs, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the indenture in its entirety.

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan or of a plan (or entity deemed to hold the assets of a plan), such as an individual retirement account, that is not subject to ERISA but is subject to Section 4975 of the Code (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”). Such a transaction could be prohibited if the transaction involves certain parties related to the Plan (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code) or if the Plan fiduciary causing the use of plan assets in the transaction has a prohibited conflict of interest or self-interest related to the transaction. Among other potential effects, a party in interest or disqualified person that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and a fiduciary that causes a Plan to enter into a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the notes or exchange notes to determine the need for and the availability of, if necessary, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the issuer of the notes, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition or holding of the notes or an interest in notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an independent “qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions involving certain non-fiduciary service providers or their affiliates. One or more of these exemptions or another exemption or exception could provide an exemption for the acquisition and holding of the notes or interests in notes from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code if its conditions are satisfied. However, there can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes or interests in notes or that all of the conditions of any such exemption will be satisfied. -99 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions or breaches of fiduciary obligations, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring the notes or interests in notes (and holding the notes or such interests) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan or plan subject to Similar Law, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption or exception would be applicable to the acquisition and holding of the notes or such interests.

The notes will only be issued in fully registered form, without interest coupons, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. No notes will be issued in bearer form. The notes sold in the offering will be issued only against payment in immediately available funds. Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A initially will be represented by permanent global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited upon issuance with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”), and registered in the name of Cede & Co. (a nominee of DTC) or another DTC nominee. The Restricted Global Notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer set forth therein and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors.” Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act initially will be represented by temporary global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Note”) and will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary. Prior to the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the issue date of the notes (such period through and including such 40th day, the “distribution compliance period”), a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be held only through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a restricted global note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. The Temporary Regulation S Global Note will be exchangeable for a single permanent global note (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Note, a “Regulation S Global Note” and together with the Restricted Global Notes, the “Global Notes”) after the expiration of the distribution compliance period and the certification required by Regulation S. Prior to such time, a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Restricted Global Note only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S. _The Global Notes. We expect that pursuant to procedures established by DTC:_ - upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount of notes of the individual beneficial interests represented by such global securities to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary; and - ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (“participants”) or persons who hold interests through participants. QIBs may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system or directly through organizations which are participants in such system. Investors may hold their interest in the Regulation S Global Note directly Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S Global Note through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as -96 ----- its depository for the interests that held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants. So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing the notes. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes. Payments of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of us, the trustee or any Paying Agent (or any of our or their agents) will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in clearinghouse funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. If a holder requires physical delivery of a certificated security for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of the notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture governing the notes. Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depository to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of those settlement systems, they are under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be changed or discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee, nor our or its agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing -97 ----- corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “Clearing Agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to the DTC system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (“indirect participants”). Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee, not our or its agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. _Certificated Securities. If DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the Global_ Notes and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days, certificated securities will be issued in exchange for the Global Notes, which certificates will bear the legend referred to under “Notice to Investors.” In connection with any proposed transfer outside the book entry-only system, the transferor shall provide the trustee with all information necessary to allow the trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including, without limitation, any cost basis reporting obligations under Internal Revenue Code Section 6045.

The possibility of such payments may implicate special rules under Treasury regulations governing “contingent payment debt instruments.” According to those Treasury regulations, the possibility that such payments of excess amounts will be made will not affect the amount of income a holder recognizes in advance of the payment of such excess amounts if there is only a remote chance, as of the date the notes are issued, that such payments will be made. PNG intends to take the position that the notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of the anticipated remote possibility of such additional payments. PNG’s determination that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments, while not binding on the IRS, is binding on holders unless they disclose their contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. However, the IRS may take a position contrary to PNG’s position. If the IRS successfully challenged PNG’s position and the notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, holders would be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the notes’ stated interest rate, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any gain recognized on a taxable disposition of a note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2021,124

This discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, each as in effect on the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change and differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change or differing interpretation could result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income purposes regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust, or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is not a U.S. Holder and that is not an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion is limited to persons who purchase the notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address tax considerations relevant to subsequent purchasers of notes. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a beneficial owner in light of that beneficial owner’s particular circumstances or that may be applicable to beneficial owners subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; - tax-exempt entities; - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other “flowthrough” entities and investors therein; - brokers or dealers in securities or currencies; - traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment; - persons required to accelerate recognition of any item of income with respect to the notes as a result of such income being included on a applicable financial statement; - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies; - certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; - holders who hold the notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, constructive sale, or other integrated security transaction; or -101 ----- - holders deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.
