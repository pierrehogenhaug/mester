668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,322,COMPANY OVERVIEW,322.2,Operational update,322.2.1,,"The global crisis resulting from the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a substantial impact on our global restaurant operations. We cannot estimate the duration or negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, however, depending on the duration and scope, we expect it could be material. In North America, substantially all of our restaurants remain open, however operations are primarily limited to Drive-thru, Takeout, and Delivery (where applicable). In Latin America, some markets have closed most restaurants and the restaurants that remain open across the region may have limited operations including Drivethru, Takeout and Delivery. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, several major markets including Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom have closed restaurants, and the restaurants that remain open across the region may have limited operations including Drive-thru, Takeout and Delivery. In Asia Pacific, some markets have closed most restaurants and the restaurants that remain open may have limited operations including Drive-thru, Takeout, and Delivery. In China, we noted in February 2020 that approximately half of our restaurants were temporarily closed. Currently, more than 90% of our restaurants in China are once again open with comparable sales that have improved but remain lower than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments, we expect our results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 have been significantly impacted and that these adverse impacts will continue beyond March 31, 2020. We currently estimate that comparable sales for the three months ended March 31, 2020 against the prior year period declined by a percentage in the mid single digits for Burger King, declined by a percentage in the low double digits for Tim Hortons and grew by a percentage in the low twenties for Popeyes. We currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our comparable sales and results of operations for the three months ending June 30, 2020 more significantly depending on the duration and scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This outlook reflects management’s estimates based solely upon information available to it as of the date hereof and is subject to change. We do not assume a duty to update this outlook, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or circumstances, change in expectations or otherwise. 2 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance of the business, excluding non-cash and other specifically identified items that management believes are not relevant to management’s assessment of operating performance or the performance of an acquired business. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, also represents our measure of segment income for each of our three operating segments.

These non-GAAP financial measures do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies in our industry.

(6) Net restaurant growth refers to the net increase in restaurant count (openings, net of closures) over a trailing twelve month period, divided by the restaurant count at the beginning of the trailing twelve month period. (7) System-wide sales are driven by sales at franchised restaurants, as approximately 100% of current restaurants are franchised.

668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.1,"Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or threats, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic events.","Unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or catastrophic events, can adversely impact restaurant sales. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and severe adverse weather conditions and health pandemics whether occurring in Canada, the United States or in other countries, can keep customers in the affected area from dining out, cause damage to or closure of restaurants and result in lost opportunities for our restaurants. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus, (COVID-19) a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, have led to an economic downturn in many of our markets. As a result of COVID-19, we and our franchisees have experienced significant store closures and instances of reduced store-level operations, including reduced operating hours and dining-room closures. As of the end of March 2020, our restaurants in the U.S. and Canada have closed dine-in operations, but are continuing to offer Drive-thru, Delivery and Take-out, sometimes with limited hours; several markets in Europe (including France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) have closed restaurants; and many other international markets also have limited operations. As a result, restaurant traffic and system-wide sales have been significantly negatively impacted. Our operating results substantially depend upon our franchisees’ sales volumes, restaurant profitability, and financial viability. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our franchisees’ liquidity. As a result, in many markets around the world, we are advancing cash payments and rebates to restaurant owners. For approximately 3,700 eligible locations where we have property control at Tim Hortons in Canada and Burger King in the United States and Canada, we have temporarily converted our rent structure from a combination of fixed plus variable rent to 100% variable rent, which provides relief in the face of declining sales. In addition, for certain locations where we have property control, we have deferred rent payments from franchisees for up to 45 days. These actions are expected to adversely affect our cash flow and financial results in the upcoming quarters. In addition to these actions, we may decide to take additional steps to assist in the financial stabilization of our franchisees which could impact our liquidity and our financial results. In addition, we are delaying the capital expenditure obligations of our franchisees relating to new restaurants, remodels and significant equipment deployments which could adversely affect our growth once the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. To the extent that our franchisees experience financial distress, it could negatively affect (i) our operating results as a result of delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund 15 ----- contributions and rents for properties we lease to them or claims under our lease guarantees, (ii) our future revenue, earnings and cash flow growth and (iii) our financial condition. COVID-19 or other events could lead to delays or interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to our franchised restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping and/or manufacturing, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors and also could lead to difficulties in maintaining appropriate staffing of restaurants. Food distributors and suppliers often operate with thin margins and therefore may be more vulnerable to governmental actions which result in significantly reduced activity or to general economic downturns. As of December 31, 2019, four distributors serviced approximately 92% of BK restaurants in the U.S. and five distributors serviced approximately 85% of PLK restaurants in the U.S. Consequently, our operations could be adversely affected if any of these distributors were unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we were unable to locate a substitute distributor in a timely manner. In addition, as COVID-19 may be transmitted through human contact, the risk or perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 could adversely affect the ability, or the cost, of staffing restaurants, which could be exacerbated to the extent that we or our franchisees have employees who test positive for the virus. We cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or when operations will cease to be affected by it. Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism or heightened security requirements will have on our future operations. Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs are fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our and our franchisees’ operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses and our loss of royalties. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to negatively impact our financial results and based on the duration and scope, such impact could be material. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the business and financial results of us and our franchisees, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section or the “Risk factors” section included in the 2019 RBI 10-K incorporated by reference herein, such as those relating to our substantial level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations, and there can be no assurances that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be on acceptable terms.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity as a shareholder. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral or to control such proceedings, will be at the direction of the collateral agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities until (x) our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) or (y) 90 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the agreement governing, and acceleration of, the series of first priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and has complied with the applicable notice provisions. However, even if the collateral agent with respect to the Notes gains the right to direct the exercise of remedies in the circumstances described above, the collateral agent must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to the collateral would revert to the collateral agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) if, the collateral agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities has commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that collateral (whether our company or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. At any time that the collateral agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities does not have the right to take actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as described above, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the collateral. As of the issue date of the Notes, that would be the collateral agent for the 2024 First Lien Notes and the 2028 First Lien Notes, rather than the authorized representative for the Notes. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the collateral agent, trustee and the holders of the Notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing that is not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or to the use of the shared collateral to secure that financing that meets certain specified conditions, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection. The collateral that will secure the Notes on a first-priority basis will also be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the authorized representative of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or, if the Senior Secured Credit Facilities have been discharged, the authorized representative for the series of first priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the collateral, during any period that such authorized representative controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The Initial 18 ----- Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections, and the existence thereof could adversely affect the value of the collateral that will secure the Notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of this Offering Memorandum exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes and the Guarantees could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and the obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest, fees and expenses may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or initiated. To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on the collateral securing the Notes, to the extent permitted under the Indenture, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the collateral subject to such liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the collateral. Additionally, collateral securing the Notes secures on a pari passu basis the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing First Lien Notes and the terms of the Indenture allow us to issue additional notes, additional debt that may rank pari passu with the Notes and incur change of control refinancing indebtedness in certain circumstances. The Indenture does not require that we maintain the current level of collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the Indenture, any such additional notes issued pursuant to the Indenture and change of control refinancing indebtedness or other additional debt incurred in accordance with the terms of the Indenture will rank pari passu with the Notes and be entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt and change of control refinancing indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the Notes from the then existing pool of collateral. Releases of collateral from the liens securing the Notes will be permitted under certain circumstances. In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any collateral or in insolvency, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements the claims of the holders of the Notes to the proceeds of such enforcement or insolvency will rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing First Lien Notes and, with respect to Tim Hortons assets that constitute collateral, holders of the Existing THI Notes, which are first priority obligations, behind the claims of holders of any senior secured indebtedness that are senior in priority to the Notes (to the extent permitted to have a prior lien on the collateral by the Indenture). The security interest of the collateral agent is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. The collateral agent may not be able to obtain any such consent. Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on such assets. Accordingly, the collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease. 19 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

The Trustee or the collateral agent may not monitor, or we may not inform the Trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisitions of property and rights that constitute collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the collateral agent for the Notes has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, as described further herein, even if the liens on collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under certain circumstances.

To the extent any liens on or security interest in the collateral securing the Notes are not perfected on or prior to such date, we will use 20 ----- our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected, to the extent required by the Indenture and the security documents, within a period of time to be agreed between the Issuers and the collateral agent. Under U.S. bankruptcy law, to the extent a security interest in certain collateral is granted or perfected after the date which is 30 days following the date this offering closes, that security interest would remain at risk of being voided as a preferential transfer by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by certain of the pledgor’s other creditors) if we were to file for bankruptcy within 90 days after the grant or after perfection (or, under certain circumstances, a longer period). In Canada, there are a number of remedies under federal and provincial legislation available to a trustee in bankruptcy, creditors of the debtor, a receiver, a monitor appointed in a Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (“CCAA”) proceeding, other court-appointed officer and other interested parties to seek to set aside or void a future pledge of collateral for existing indebtedness. See “—Risks related to the ownership of the notes— Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.

Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of the mortgages and the delivery of the title insurance policies and surveys may impact the value of the collateral. Delivery and recordation of such mortgages after the issue date of the Notes increases the risk that the liens granted by those mortgages could be avoided. One or more of these mortgages may constitute a significant portion of the value of the collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees.","We do not expect that mortgages on the properties intended to secure the Notes will be in place at the time of the issuance of the Notes. The properties constitute a significant portion of the value of the collateral intended to secure the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, mortgagee title insurance policies will not be in place at the time of the issuance of the Notes to insure, among other things, (i) loss resulting from the entity represented by us to be the fee owner thereof not holding valid fee title to the properties or such fee being encumbered by unpermitted liens and (ii) the validity and lien priority of the mortgage granted to the collateral agent for its benefit, and for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. There will be no independent assurance prior to issuance of the Notes that all properties contemplated to be mortgaged as security for the Notes will be mortgaged, or that we hold the real property interests we represent we hold or that we may mortgage such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such real property interests other than those permitted by the Indenture. Moreover, land surveys will not be completed at the time of the issuance of the Notes. As a result, there is no independent assurance that, among other things, no encroachments, adverse possession claims, zoning or other restrictions exist with respect to the properties intended to be mortgaged which could result in a material adverse effect on the value or utility of such properties. The title insurance process and surveys could reveal certain issues that we will not be able to resolve. If we are unable to resolve any issues raised by the surveys or that are otherwise raised in connection with obtaining the mortgages or title insurance policies, the mortgages and title insurance policies will be subject to such issues. Such issues could have a significant impact on the value of the collateral or any recovery under the title insurance policies. If we are unable to obtain any mortgage or title insurance policy on any of the real property intended to constitute collateral for the Notes and Guarantees, the value of the collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be significantly reduced.

Your rights as a creditor may be limited under the bankruptcy and insolvency laws of Canada, and the liens securing the Notes and the related guarantees may be junior to certain other claims.","Under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, courts have jurisdiction over a debtor’s property wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. However, courts outside of the United States may not recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a U.S. bankruptcy case or ruling involving the Issuers, because their center of main interest and/or the substantial majority of their respective property are located outside of the United States. Any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy court in the United States may not be enforceable against the Issuers with respect to their property located outside the United States. Similarly, under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws, courts have jurisdiction over a debtor’s property wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. However, courts outside of Canada may not recognize the Canadian court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a Canadian bankruptcy or insolvency case involving the Issuers, because their center of main interest and/or the substantial majority of their respective property is located outside of Canada. Any orders or judgments of a Canadian court may not be enforceable against the Issuers with respect to their property located outside Canada. Similar difficulties may arise in administering bankruptcy cases in other jurisdictions. Under the Indenture and the collateral documents, the respective rights of the collateral agent and the Trustee for the Notes to enforce remedies on behalf of the holders of the Notes are likely to be significantly impaired if the Issuers and/or any Guarantor seeks the benefit of applicable Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) (the “BIA”) and the CCAA contain provisions enabling an “insolvent person” to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and others, allowing it to retain possession and administration of its property and to prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement for consideration by all or some of its creditors to be voted on by the various classes of its creditors. The restructuring plan or proposal, if accepted by the requisite majorities of creditors and if approved by the court, would likely result in the compromise or extinguishment of your rights under the Notes and may result in the debtor retaining possession and administration of its property notwithstanding that an event of default has occurred under the Notes. Moreover, in such proceedings, the court may, subject to certain conditions, create court-ordered charges on the assets of the debtor to secure interim financing, professional fees, post-filing amounts owing to critical suppliers, statutory director liabilities or other amounts, in priority to the liens that secure the Notes. One of the factors that a court is required to consider before granting such courtordered charges is whether any creditor would be materially prejudiced by the granting of such a charge; however, this is only one of the factors that the court will assess in such circumstances and there is no express concept of “adequate protection” under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws. Moreover, certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements may limit the collateral agent’s voting rights on a proposal or plan of 22 ----- arrangement and may limit the collateral agent’s ability to seek other protection for the holders of the Notes. See “Description of notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreements.” The powers of the courts under the BIA and particularly under the CCAA have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, the Issuers cannot predict whether payments under the Notes would be made following commencement of or during such a proceeding, whether or when the collateral agent and the Trustee for the Notes could exercise their respective rights under the Indenture and the related security documents, whether your claims could be compromised or extinguished under such a proceeding or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for delays in payment, if any, of principal and interest. Further, in a CCAA proceeding the total amount of all pension plan deficiencies may be held to rank in priority to all of our existing secured and unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes, based on the facts and context of the CCAA filing at the time. In addition to the insolvency statutes described above, certain restructurings of bank and bond debt have also taken place by way of court approved arrangements under Canadian corporate statutes. Some of these corporate debt restructurings have been court approved with only the required consent of debt holders representing at least two-thirds of the principal amount of the affected debt (voting by class or, in some cases, voting together with other classes of debt) voted in respect of the debt restructuring notwithstanding contrary voting or consent threshold requirements in the documentation evidencing the affected debt.

Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void the Notes or the Guarantees and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes such that the resources of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the Notes.","Each Guarantor will guarantee the payment of the Notes on a first lien senior secured basis. Each Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the collateral agent with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The Issuers or their creditors or the creditors of one or more Guarantors could challenge the issuances of any of the Notes or the Guarantees and any related security as fraudulent transfers, conveyances or preferences, transfers at under value or on other grounds under applicable Canadian federal or provincial law or applicable U.S. federal or state law. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. A court could void the obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes if, among other things, it were to determine that the Issuers or the applicable Guarantor: - issued the Note or Guarantee or related security with the intent to prefer or defeat, hinder, delay or defraud its existing or future creditors; - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the Note or the Guarantee or related security and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the Note or the Guarantee, (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note or Guarantee, or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - under Canadian law only and with respect only to the Issuer and Guarantors that are Canadian companies, acted in an oppressive manner, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly disregarded the interests of any stakeholder or other interested party. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture, which are also subject to the risk of being avoided as a preference to the extent they are issued after the date this offering closes. 24 ----- As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its Guarantee or security interest to the extent such Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the Notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law being applied in any particular proceeding, such that we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. Generally, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside (although this provision may not be effective (as a legal matter or otherwise) to protect the Guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws). However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. Under U.S. and Canadian law, to the extent a court voids a Guarantee and any related security as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or preference transfer at under value or holds it invalid or unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Notes would cease to have any direct claim against the Guarantor that delivered the Guarantee and would be creditors solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which has not been declared invalid or void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the Notes would be, to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance transfer at under value or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196
668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to the ownership of the notes,13.2.18,Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided in a bankruptcy.,"The Indenture and the security documents will require us to grant liens on certain assets that we or any Guarantor acquires after the Notes are issued. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the collateral agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or other third parties (including other creditors) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in the U.S., or “is not dealing at arm’s length” under the BIA, in Canada), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the BIA or the CCAA (as applicable) then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as 25 ----- if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and recorded outside of such 90 day period. Accordingly, if we or any subsidiary Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the outstanding Notes and any liens securing the Notes had been perfected less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such liens may be particularly subject to challenge as a result of having been delivered within such period of 90 days. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196
668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to the ownership of the notes,13.2.19,"Rights of the holders of the Notes in the collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings and the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.","The right of the collateral agent for the Notes to repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by U.S. bankruptcy law if U.S. bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the Notes, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making such payments), whether or when the collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral, or whether or to what extent the holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and any additional obligations secured by first priority liens, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. Similarly, in Canada, the right of the collateral agent for the Notes to repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency law if such proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Pursuant to the stay imposed in certain Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the Notes, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor, or from disposing of security from a debtor, without court approval. Moreover, certain Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings permit the debtor (or its trustee, receiver or 26 ----- similar representative) to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments. In view of the broad discretionary powers of the court in such proceedings, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of such a proceeding, whether or when the collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the collateral, or whether or to what extent the holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral or would recover the full amount owing to them. The payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees during the debtor’s bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may not be permitted by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

Upon a change of control, we may be required to offer to repurchase or repay our outstanding indebtedness and other obligations, including the Notes and the Existing Notes. We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient resources to repurchase the Notes or repay our other indebtedness, if such debt is required to be repurchased or repaid, upon the occurrence of a change of control. In any case, third-party financing most likely would be required in order to provide the funds necessary for the Issuers to make the change of control offer for the Notes and to refinance any other indebtedness that would become payable upon the occurrence of such events. We may not be able to obtain such additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all. See “Description of notes—Change of control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of notes—Change of control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

We expect the Notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule 144A, but we do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities exchange or include the Notes in any automated quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes, and, if commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. As a result, the liquidity of the secondary market for the Notes may be materially adversely affected by the unavailability of a current “market-making” prospectus. Therefore, an active market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the Notes. In that case, the holders of the Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your Notes.

Certain of our directors and officers, as well as certain of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum, are residents of Canada, and all or a substantial portion of their respective assets and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons. Furthermore, it may not be possible for you to enforce against the Issuer or them, in the United States, judgments obtained in U.S. courts, because a substantial portion of the Issuer’s and their assets are located outside the United States. A monetary judgment of a U.S. court predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws would likely be enforceable in Canada if the U.S. court in which the judgment was obtained had a basis for jurisdiction over the matter that was recognized by a Canadian court for such purposes. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that this will be the case. In addition, it is less certain that an action can be brought in Canada in the first instance on the basis of liability predicated solely upon such laws. Therefore, it may not be possible to enforce those judgments against the Issuers, the Guarantors, certain of their respective directors and officers or some of the experts named in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, foreign exchange, administration and other laws of Canada may be materially different from those of the United States, including in respect of creditors’ rights and remedies, priority of creditors, priority claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding.

Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), however, contains rules that result in a non-U.S. corporation being taxed as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless certain tests, applied at the time of the acquisition, regarding ownership of such entities (as relevant here, ownership by former Burger King shareholders) or level of business activities (as relevant here, business activities in Canada by us and our affiliates, including Partnership), were satisfied at such time. The U.S. Treasury Regulations apply these same rules to non-U.S. publicly traded partnerships, such as Partnership. While we believe that the Company and Partnership should not be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. These statutory and regulatory rules are relatively new, their application is complex and there is little guidance regarding their application. Moreover, there could be a change in law that would result in the Company and/or Partnership being treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If it were determined that we and/or Partnership should be taxed as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and Partnership could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income tax and the payments of interest on the Notes would be subject to U.S. federal withholding taxes in certain circumstances (including under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, commonly known as “FATCA,” retroactive to the Issue Date). For Canadian tax purposes, we and Partnership are expected, regardless of any application of Section 7874 of the Code, to be treated as a Canadian resident company and partnership, respectively.

Following the Issue Date, Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in “—Certain covenants—Limitation on guarantees.” The non-guarantors accounted for (i) approximately $763 million, or 14%, of our revenues and approximately $419 million, or 18%, of our Adjusted EBITDA, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) approximately $532 million, or 3%, of our total liabilities and approximately $2,111 million, or 9%, of our total assets, in each case as of December 31, 2019. Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the ownership of the notes—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void the Notes or the Guarantees and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes such that the resources of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the Notes.” The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged: (1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor to a Person other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise permitted by the Indenture (2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge”; 42 ----- (4) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to in such clause; (5) upon such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an “Other Guarantee”) as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain covenants—Limitation on guarantees,” the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness specified in clause (i) or (ii) (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such Indebtedness of such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any Other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated); (6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and (8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuers, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuers (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

In the Collateral Documents, the Issuers and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions described below or as set forth in the Collateral Documents, will grant Notes Liens in (collectively, excluding the Excluded Property, the “Collateral”): (1) 100% of the Capital Stock of the Co-Issuer and certain existing and future wholly owned material Subsidiaries of the Issuers or any Guarantor; (2) 65% of the Capital Stock of certain existing and future wholly owned material non-U.S. Subsidiaries or Domestic Foreign Holding Companies, in each case, of a U.S. Subsidiary of the Issuer; and 43 ----- (3) substantially all of the other property and assets (including fee-owned real property and tangible and intangible personal property such as, among other assets, intellectual property, investment property, accounts receivable (other than Securitization Assets or Receivables Assets to the extent excluded under the Credit Agreement), inventory, equipment and contract rights), in each case, that are held by the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, to the extent that such assets secure the First Priority Credit Obligations and to the extent that a first priority security interest is able to be granted or perfected therein. The Indenture and the Collateral Documents will exclude certain property from the Collateral (the “Excluded Property”), including: (1) any property or assets owned by any Subsidiaries organized outside of a Covered Jurisdiction; (2) any fee-owned real property located outside the Covered Jurisdictions or with a value of less than the amount provided in the Collateral Documents or that is located in a jurisdiction other than the Covered Jurisdictions held by the Issuers or any Guarantor and all leasehold interests in real property; (3) any vehicle covered by a certificate of title or ownership and any other assets subject to certificates of title to the extent a lien therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a UCC or PPSA financing statement (or analogous procedures under the applicable laws in the relevant Covered Jurisdiction), letter of credit rights to the extent a lien therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a UCC or PPSA financing statement (or analogous procedures under the applicable laws in the relevant Covered Jurisdiction) and commercial tort claims; (4) any deposit accounts, securities accounts (including securities entitlements and related assets) or cash, other than any proceeds of Collateral; (5) any assets where a pledge and security interest thereon is prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation; (6) any lease, license or other agreement or permit or any property subject to a purchase money security interest, Capitalized Lease Obligations or similar arrangements, in each case, to the extent permitted under the Indenture to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement, purchase money, capital lease or a similar arrangement or create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than the Issuers or a Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or PPSA or other applicable law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition; (7) any United States intent-to-use trademark application prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, that, and solely during the period, if any, in which, the creation by the Issuers or a Guarantor of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark application under applicable federal law, rule or regulation; (8) any Rule 3-16 Capital Stock (as defined below); (9) certain other exceptions described in the Collateral Documents; and (10) so long as the First Priority Credit Obligations are outstanding, any assets not pledged to secure the First Priority Credit Obligations. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in addition to other exceptions and limitations described in the Collateral Documents, in no event shall the Issuers or any Guarantor be required to (x) create any security interests in assets located, titled, registered or filed outside of the Covered Jurisdictions or to perfect such security interests or (y) deliver (A) control agreements, (B) landlord waivers, (C) bailee letters, (D) other 44 ----- similar third party documents, or (E)—security agreements, pledge agreements, or share charge (or mortgage) agreements governed under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the Covered Jurisdictions. Subject to the foregoing, if property that is intended to be Collateral is acquired by the Issuers or a Guarantor (including property of a Person that becomes a new Guarantor) that is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the Collateral Documents, then the Issuers or such Guarantor will provide a Notes Lien over such property (or, in the case of a new Guarantor, such of its property) in favor of the Collateral Agent and deliver certain certificates and opinions in respect thereof, all as and to the extent required by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Documents. As set out in more detail below, subject to certain exceptions, upon an enforcement event, insolvency or liquidation proceeding permitted under the terms of the Indenture, proceeds from the Collateral will be applied to satisfy First Priority Credit Obligations and obligations under the Notes and Future First Lien Indebtedness on a pari passu basis. In addition, the Indenture will permit the Issuers and the Guarantors to create additional Liens under specified circumstances. See “Certain definitions—Permitted Liens.” The Collateral will be pledged to (1) the collateral agent under the Credit Agreement, on a first priority basis, for the benefit of the Senior Secured Credit Facility Secured Parties to secure the First Priority Credit Obligations, (2) the collateral agents under the Existing First Lien Notes Indentures for the benefit of the Existing First Lien Notes Secured Parties to secure the Existing First Lien Notes Obligations, (3) the Collateral Agent, on a first priority basis, for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and (4) the Second Lien Collateral Agent, on a second priority basis, for its benefit, the benefit of the Second Lien Trustee and the Holders of the Second Lien Notes and holders of any other Second Priority Obligations. The First Priority Obligations will constitute claims separate and apart from (and of a different class from) the Second Priority Obligations. The liens securing First Priority Obligations will be senior to the liens securing Second Priority Obligations on the terms set forth in the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the liens securing the Notes will be pari passu in right of payment and security with the liens securing the First Priority Credit Obligations. To the extent that Liens (including Permitted Liens), rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by the Issuers or the Guarantors, including the Collateral, such third parties may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196
668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.6,Security,124.6.2,Certain bankruptcy and insolvency limitations,"The right of the Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by U.S. bankruptcy law in the event that a U.S. bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against the Issuers or any Guarantor prior to the Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”), a secured creditor such as the Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security without bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the lack of precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of Post-Petition Interest (including costs and attorneys’ fees) to a secured creditor during 45 ----- a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (and all other obligations secured by a first lien on the Collateral), the Holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. In addition because the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under federal or provincial, as applicable, laws of Canada, the rights of the Collateral Agent to enforce remedies on behalf of Holders are likely to be significantly impaired by the restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the Companies’ Creditors _Arrangement Act (Canada) contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to obtain a stay of proceedings_ against its creditors and others, allowing it to retain possession and administration of its property and to prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement for consideration by all or some of its creditors to be voted on by the various classes of its creditors affected thereby. Such a restructuring plan or proposal, if accepted by the requisite majorities of creditors and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would likely result in the compromise or extinguishment of the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Notes and may result in the debtor retaining possession and administration of its property notwithstanding that an event of default occurred under the Notes. The powers of the court under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and particularly under the _Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity_ from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot predict if payments under the Notes would be made following commencement of or during any such proceeding, whether or when the Collateral Agent could exercise its rights under the Indenture and the applicable Collateral Documents, whether claims of Holders could be compromised or extinguished under such a proceeding or whether and to what extent Holders would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the Collateral Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

In addition, the Collateral Documents will generally not require the Issuers and the Guarantors to take certain actions to perfect the liens of the Collateral Agent in certain of the Collateral, including, prior to the repayment in full of First Priority Credit Obligations, if such actions are not requested by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral.

The trustee under the Existing THI Notes is not a party to the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement. All references to the First Priority Obligations in this section of the Description of Notes shall refer only to such First Priority Obligations subject to the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and will remain the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Priority Obligations that are First Priority Credit Obligations and (2) the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the First Priority Collateral Agent (other than the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent) of the Series of First Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Obligations (excluding the Series of First Priority Credit Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral, but solely to the extent that such Series of First Priority Obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the Series of First Priority Credit Obligations then outstanding (the “Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”). With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Applicable Authorized Representative or other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall or shall instruct the Applicable Authorized Representative to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral. The “Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Applicable Authorized Representative, the date that is 90 days (throughout which 90-day period such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of First Priority Obligations, and (b) the Applicable Authorized Representative and each other First Priority Collateral Agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of First Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of First Priority Obligations; provided that the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative has 48 ----- commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuers or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The Applicable Authorized Representative is currently the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the Collateral Agent will have no rights to take any action under the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Authorized Representative may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Applicable Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the First Priority Secured Parties also will agree that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Authorized Representative is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuers or any Guarantor or any First Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any First Priority Collateral Agent or any First Priority Secured Party and proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First Priority Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall, subject to the terms of the THI Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to the THI Collateral, be applied among the First Priority Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each First Priority Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such). It is the intention of the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of First Priority Obligations of such Series (and not the First Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations), (y) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to Mortgaged Properties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which applies to all First Priority Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Priority Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Priority Obligations permitted by the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Priority Obligations of 49 ----- any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First Priority Obligations or the First Priority Documents governing such First Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy case or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, none of the First Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any First Priority Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any bankruptcy case or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other First Priority Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and each other Series of First Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuers or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuers or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each First Priority Secured Party will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP _Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable_ Authorized Representative with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) First Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement; 50 ----- (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any First Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_ secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The First Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Priority Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Priority Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of Proceeds set forth in the First Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Priority Secured Parties of any Series. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, and after the Discharge of the First Priority Credit Obligations, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be authorized, to, if applicable, act under the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity as “First Priority Designated Agent.” Pursuant to the provisions of the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the First Priority Designated Agent will be entitled to receive any proceeds of Collateral in the case of a turn over by the holders of any Second Priority Obligations and the First Priority Designated Agent will have a right to approve forms of certain joinder, release and other documents. _First priority/second priority intercreditor agreement_ On the Issue Date the Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder agreement to the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First Priority/Second _Priority Intercreditor Agreement”), dated as of December 12, 2014, as supplemented, by and among the Second_ Lien Collateral Agent, the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the collateral agents for the Existing First Lien Notes. The trustee under the Existing THI Notes will not be a party to the First Priority/ Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement. All references to the First Priority Obligations in this section of the Description of Notes shall refer only to such First Priority Obligations subject to the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

So long as the Discharge of Senior Lender Claims has not occurred, the Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies as a secured party, shall be applied by the First Priority Designated Agent to the First Priority Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant First Priority Documents until the Discharge of Senior Lender Claims has occurred. In addition, if the Issuer, Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the Second Lien Collateral Agent, the Second Lien Trustee and the Holders of the Second Lien Notes have agreed that: (1) if any First Priority Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use of cash collateral or to permit the Issuer, Co-Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing, then the Second Lien Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Second Lien Notes agree not to object to, and will not support any objection to, such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by clause (5) below) and, to the extent the Liens securing First Priority Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral to (x) the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto), (y) any adequate protection provided to such First Lien Agent or the holders of First Priority Obligations or (z) any carve-out for fees agreed to by such First Lien Agent or the holders of First Priority Obligations, in each case on the same basis as their Liens are subordinated to the Liens securing the First Priority Obligations; (2) they will not object to, will not support any objection to and will not otherwise contest any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of First Priority Obligations made by the First Priority Collateral Agent or any holder of such obligations; (3) they will not object to, will not support any objection to and will not otherwise contest any order relating to a sale of assets of the Issuer, Co-Issuer or any Guarantor for which the First Priority Collateral Agent has consented that provides, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing First Priority Obligations and the Second Lien Notes will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the existing Liens in accordance with the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (4) until the Discharge of Senior Lender Claims, none of them will seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Collateral, without the prior written consent of the First Priority Collateral Agents and required holders of First Priority Obligations; (5) none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting) (a) any request by any First Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Obligations for adequate protection, (b) any objection by any First Priority Collateral Agent or the holders of First Priority Obligations to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on any First Priority Collateral Agent’s or the holders of First Priority 52 ----- Obligations’ claiming a lack of adequate protection or (c) the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to the First Priority Collateral Agents or the holders of First Priority Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of First Priority Obligations (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of additional collateral and/or superpriority claims in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or Section 364 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, then the Second Lien Collateral Agent (A) may seek or request adequate protection in the form of (x) a replacement Lien on such additional collateral, which Lien is subordinated to the Liens securing the First Priority Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Lien Notes are so subordinated to the Liens securing First Priority Obligations under the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement and (y) superpriority claims junior in all respects to the superpriority claims granted to the holders of First Priority Obligations, and (B) agrees that it will not seek or request, and will not accept, without the express written consent of the First Priority Collateral Agents, adequate protection in any other form, and (ii) (A) in the event the Second Lien Collateral Agent seeks or requests adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of additional collateral, then the Second Lien Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Second Lien Notes agree that the holders of the First Priority Obligations shall also be granted a senior Lien on such additional collateral as security for the applicable First Priority Obligations and any such DIP Financing and that any Lien on such additional collateral securing the Second Lien Notes shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing the First Priority Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens granted to the holders of First Priority Obligations as adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Second Lien Notes are so subordinated to such Liens securing First Priority Obligations under the First Priority/Second Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and (B) in the event the Second Lien Collateral Agent seeks or requests adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a superpriority claim, then the Second Lien Collateral Agent and the Holders of Second Lien Notes agree that the holders of the First Priority Obligations shall also be granted a superpriority claim, which superpriority claim will be senior in all respects to the superpriority claim granted to the Second Lien Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Second Lien Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the holders of First Priority Obligations are deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding to be entitled to receive adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current Post-Petition Interest, incurred fees and expenses or other cash payments, then the Second Lien Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Second Lien Notes shall not be prohibited from seeking or receiving adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current Post-Petition Interest, incurred fees and expenses or other cash payments; and (6) until the Discharge of Senior Lender Claims has occurred, the Second Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and each Holder of Second Lien Notes, (i) will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the United States Bankruptcy Code senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the First Priority Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any collateral, and (ii) waives any claim it may have arising out of the election by any holder of First Priority Obligations of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code. _THI Intercreditor agreement_ The Collateral Agent will also enter into a Fourth Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement (“THI _Intercreditor Agreement”) with the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the collateral agents_ for the Existing First Lien Notes, the trustee (the “THI Notes Trustee”) under the indenture governing the Existing THI Notes (the “THI Notes Indenture”) and the issuer under the THI Notes Indenture (the “THI Notes _Issuer”).

Specifically, the THI Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent the THI Collateral is subject to a Notes Lien granted in favour of the Collateral Agent, the collateral agents under the Existing First Lien Notes Indenture or the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, those Notes Liens will secure the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Indenture (including under the Notes) and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on an equal basis, ranking ratably and pari passu, with any Liens on that Collateral granted by the THI Notes Issuer and any THI Notes Guarantors in favour of the THI Notes Trustee securing their obligations under the THI Note Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

In addition, the Issuers and each Guarantor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court documentation, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest, additions to tax and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the receipt of 58 ----- any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, the execution, issue, delivery or registration of the Notes, any Guarantee or the Indenture or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges, duties or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, such Guarantee or the Indenture or any such other document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes. Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor will, however, pay such amounts that are imposed on or result from a sale or other transfer or disposition by a holder or beneficial owner of a Note. The preceding provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor person to the Issuers or any Guarantor is organized, incorporated or otherwise resident or engaged in or carrying on business for tax purposes and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. Whenever the Indenture or this “Description of notes” refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to the Notes (including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts, if applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the captions “—Change of control” and “—Certain covenants—Limitations on sales of assets and subsidiary stock.” As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Investor, its respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or, at the Issuers’ option, mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. 59 ----- If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196
668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.14,Change of control,124.14.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless a third party makes a Change of Control Offer or the Issuers have previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of control,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Credit Agreement contains, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers become a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuers would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture) and prohibit or limit the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. In addition, the indentures governing the Existing First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes will require us to make a change of control offer with respect to the Existing First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes, respectively, which may further limit the funds available to us to make any required repurchases of the Notes. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary 60 ----- to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension _Period.”_ On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on restricted payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on restricted payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period; provided, that, no Subsidiaries may be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on restricted payments” as if such covenant would have been in effect during such period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on restricted payments.” During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or the occurrence of a Reversion Date.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

(10) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Issuer. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or total assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or 67 ----- transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. 68 ----- The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor to Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer, Co-Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Co-Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for any period. 76 ----- For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions in amounts sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent Entity, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

The Credit Agreement will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports (and the information contained therein) and information for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with the reporting obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to the other remedies provided under the heading “—Events of default.” The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its judgment as to what is prudent at the time, to participate in quarterly conference calls (which may be a single conference call together with investors and lenders holding other securities or Indebtedness of the Issuer, its Restricted Subsidiaries and/or any Parent Entity) to discuss results of operations. The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that, the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited. 89 ----- The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the Issuers’ compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any agreement or 93 ----- obligation contained in the Indenture or the Collateral Documents; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice described in this clause has been given; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross _acceleration provision”);_ and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of $375 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA or more at any one time outstanding; (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection in the United States, Canada or other applicable jurisdictions of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy _provisions”);_ (6) failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of $375 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”); (7) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other than (1) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (2) a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture or (3) in connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full force as a result of a bankruptcy are less than the greater of $375 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA; (8) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents, the Notes Liens with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable, or the Issuer or the Co-Issuer shall assert or any Guarantor shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and, in the case of any 94 ----- such Guarantor, the Issuer fails to cause such Guarantor to rescind such assertions within 30 days after the Issuer has actual knowledge of such assertions; or (9) the failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Collateral Documents except for a failure that would not be material to the Holders of the Notes and would not materially affect the value of the Collateral taken as a whole (together with the defaults described in clauses (8) and (9) the “security default provisions”). However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (6) or (9) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3), (6) and (9) the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (3), (6) and (9), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or Collateral Agent, if applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee and Collateral Agent, if applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee and Collateral Agent, if applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee and Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. 95 ----- Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee and Collateral Agent, if applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer or the Co-Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer or the Co-Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; 96 ----- (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee or the Collateral Agent. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether any direction is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” The Notes will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

The Issuer is an indirect subsidiary of Restaurant Brands International and the indirect parent company of The TDL Group Corp.

The Issuers will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuers, the Guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and is exempt from (or otherwise not subject to) the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. See “Notice to investors.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof. The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. Copies of the proposed form of the Indenture are available as described under “Where you can find more information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain definitions.” The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain definitions” below are used in this “Description of notes” as so defined.

The Issuers will not be required to, nor do the Issuers currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the U.S. Securities Act or Canadian Securities Legislation. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

The Co-Issuer is a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Issuer that has been incorporated in Delaware as a special purpose finance subsidiary to facilitate the offering of the Notes and other debt securities of the Issuer. The Co-Issuer will not have any substantial operations or assets and will not have any revenues.

668,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,The Global Notes,239.1.1,,"The Issuers expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the Notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that 159 ----- interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the Notes. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuers, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. The Issuers expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit participants, accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. The Issuers also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security or any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of the Notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. DTC has advised the Issuers that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which include a legend as set forth under the heading “Notice to investors.” DTC has advised the Issuers as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants, accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the registrar or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. 160 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,196

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC participant through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system.

Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

Section 7874 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a corporation that is not organized or incorporated in the United States to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Treasury Regulations apply these same rules to non-U.S. publicly traded partnerships, such as Partnership. These rules are complex and in some cases, there is limited guidance as to their application. We believe RBI and Partnership should not be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, as discussed above in “Risk factors—The Company and Partnership may be treated as U.S. _corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us and Partnership to substantial additional U.S. taxes,” it is possible that the IRS could disagree with our intended treatment. Furthermore, there_ could be a change in law under Section 7874 of the Code, in the regulations promulgated thereunder, or other changes in law or subsequent changes in facts that could (possibly retroactively) cause Partnership to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that Partnership will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code, but there can be no assurances in this regard.

The obligations to make such payments may implicate the provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments” (the “CPDI Rules”). The Issuer intends to take the position that these provisions will not cause the Notes to be subject to these rules. This position is based in part on the Issuer’s determination that the likelihood, as of the issue date, that such additional amounts will have to be paid is remote. The Issuer’s position is binding on a Holder, unless the Holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. The Issuer’s position is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenged the Issuer’s position, the tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes could be materially and adversely different from those described herein, including with respect to the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognized.

Proposed Treasury regulations provide that this obligation will not apply until the date that is two years after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed. Moreover, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.

In addition, backup withholding is required on (i) such payments made to a U.S. Holder unless the U.S. Holder furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number (which for an individual is the Social Security Number) and certifies on an IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that the U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules and (ii) such payments made to a Non-U.S. Holder unless the Non-U.S. Holder establishes an exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying such holder’s non-U.S. status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY, as applicable.

The discussion is based on the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect and all subject to change at any time, perhaps with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this discussion, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. We have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. The Issuer is treated as a disregarded entity owned by Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Co-Issuer is a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Issuer that has been incorporated in Delaware as a special purpose finance subsidiary to facilitate the offering of the Notes and other debt securities of the Issuer. The Co-Issuer will not have any substantial operations or assets, will not have any revenues, and will not receive any proceeds from the offering (and is not expected to make any payments with respect to the Notes). Accordingly, subject to the risk of the Partnership being recharacterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a U.S. corporation (as discussed below under “Characterization of Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes”), the following discussion treats Partnership as the issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes and assumes that all interest payable on the Notes will be non-U.S. source. This discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash in this offering and at their original “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), and who hold Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular purchasers of Notes (including the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income), and does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws, or any U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (such as estate or gift tax).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust (i) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and as to which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid election in place to continue to be treated as a U.S. person.

For example, both the BIA and the CCAA contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and others. Under Canadian insolvency laws, a debtor is able to prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement to be voted on by the various classes of its affected creditors. A proposal, compromise or arrangement, if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors, and if sanctioned by the relevant Canadian court, would be binding on all creditors within each affected class regardless of whether they voted to accept the proposal or plan. The proposal or plan can result in any claims against the debtor company being compromised or extinguished. Moreover, these laws permit the insolvent debtor to retain possession and administration of its property, subject to court oversight, even though it may be in default under the applicable debt instrument during the period the stay against proceedings remains in place. The powers of the court under the BIA and particularly under the CCAA have been exercised broadly to protect an entity attempting to restructure its affairs from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the Notes would be made during any Canadian proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency (including receivership) or other restructuring, whether or when the collateral agent could exercise their rights under the Indenture governing the Notes or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursement of the trustees or whether, and to what extent, the obligations under the Notes could be compromised in such proceedings. The Issuer is formed under the laws of British Columbia and, while a substantial portion of its assets are located outside of Canada, its registered and head office is currently located in Canada. Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Part IV of the CCAA provide for the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings. Courts in either jurisdiction have the authority to recognize a foreign insolvency proceeding as either a foreign main proceeding or a foreign non-main proceeding, on the proof of certain threshold requirements. In order for a 179 ----- Canadian court to recognize a U.S. insolvency proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, it would have to be satisfied, among other things, that the United States is the jurisdiction of the debtor’s center of main interest. In Canada, in the absence of proof to the contrary, a debtor company’s registered office is deemed to be the center of its main interest.

In addition, affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers are lenders and/or agents under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and as such are entitled to certain fees and expenses in connection therewith. The Issuers expect to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates.

Typically, these Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. For the reasons described above, the Issuers may each be considered a “connected issuer” of the Initial Purchasers under applicable Canadian securities laws. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be holders of the Existing First Lien Notes and/or the Existing Second Lien Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers (or one of their respective affiliates) served as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunning managers in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and each of the Initial Purchasers (or one of their respective affiliates) are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.
