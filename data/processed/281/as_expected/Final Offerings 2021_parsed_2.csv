Effective January 1, 2020, this segment also captures the sale of connected cameras under the Arlo brand in Europe. As these sales are not considered a part of our core alarms business, we have decided to categorize these revenues under a separate reporting segment. The effect of these changes in reporting is to reallocate certain revenues previously included in our Portfolio Services segment to the separate Adjacencies segment. The Senior Notes Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, reflect the introduction of the Adjacencies reporting segment. Comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in the Senior Notes Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been restated in order to give effect to the introduction of the Adjacencies reporting segment as if it had occurred on January 1, 2017.

The new standard replaces the previous accounting standard, IAS 17 (Leases), including related interpretations. We have applied exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items and have chosen to adopt the modified retrospective transition approach for IFRS 16 under which, prior to reflecting the impact of lease incentives, we evaluated our lease liability using incremental borrowing rates assessed at the date of transition with a right of use asset of equal value to the lease liability with adjustment of any prepaid costs.

Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding operating results.

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.3,Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Information,7.3.1,,"We have included in this offering memorandum the following financial measures: - “Adjusted EBITDA” refers to result for the period adjusted as further described under footnote (7) under “Summary Consolidated Historical Financial and Other Data”; - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” refers to Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue; - “Adjusted EBITDA, last two quarters annualized” refers to our last two quarters of Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by two; - “Adjusted EBITDA Before SDIs” refers to result for the period adjusted as further described under footnote (7) under “Summary Consolidated Historical Financial and Other Data”; - “Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services” refers to Adjusted EBITDA from our Portfolio Services segment, calculated as further described under footnote (17) under “Summary Consolidated Historical _Financial and Other Data”;_ - “Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services, last two quarters annualized” refers to our last two quarters of Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services, multiplied by two; - “Adjusted EBITDA from Customer Acquisition” refers to Adjusted EBITDA from our Customer Acquisition segment, calculated as further described under footnote (17) under “Summary Consolidated _Historical Financial and Other Data”;_ - “Adjusted EBITDA from Adjacencies” refers to Adjusted EBITDA from our Adjacencies segment, calculated as further described under footnote (17) under “Summary Consolidated Historical Financial _and Other Data”;_ - “Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized” refers to our last two quarters of Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by two, as further adjusted by the pro forma calculations described under footnote (29) under “Summary Consolidated Historical Financial and Other Data”; and - “Last two quarters annualized” refers to our last two quarters of the relevant metric, multiplied by two. Certain financial measures and ratios related thereto in this offering memorandum, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before SDIs, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, last two quarters annualized, Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services, Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services, last two quarters annualized, Adjusted EBITDA from Customer Acquisition, Adjusted EBITDA from Adjacencies and Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally_ accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance, liquidity and financing structure. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to gross profit, operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our management believes this information, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in evaluating the operating performance. The EBITDA and other non-IFRS metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of the limitations relating to EBITDA-based metrics are: ii ----- - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, such metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See “Summary Consolidated _Historical Financial and Other Data,” “Selected Consolidated Historical and Other Financial Data,”_ “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In this offering memorandum we also present certain operating metrics for each of our segments. Certain of the operating metrics are not specifically defined under IFRS. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure. We have defined each of the metrics and shown their calculation in “Summary Consolidated Historical Financial and Other Data.” The metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles. These non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements.

Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “seek” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled “Risk _Factors” in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the_ forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - our ability to compete effectively in our industry; - rapid changes in technology and our ability to successfully manage and address customer expectations; - adverse changes in general economic conditions; - our ability to retain our existing customers and to acquire new subscribers on a cost effective basis; - our exposure in Iberia (Spain and Portugal); - our ability to compete effectively with bundled products and services that may be offered by certain of our potential competitors; - privacy concerns and potential security breaches; - compliance with regulations regarding the use of personal customer data; - costs associated with potential competition with our former parent or disputes over our primary brand name; - costs associated with our continued investment in building our brands; - difficulties we may face in increasing our subscriber base or our subscription fees or up-selling new products to our current subscribers; - increasing operating costs and inflation risks and inability to realize efficiencies and cost savings associated with implementation of our FOG program; - increased labor costs in the jurisdictions in which we operate; - prolonged disruption of our monitoring centers; - disruption as a result of COVID-19; - product defects or shortfalls in our customer service; - possible liability associated with our ability to respond adequately to alarm activations; - costs of complying with current or future regulatory requirements; - false alarm ordinances introduced by local governments; ii ----- - disruptions in our supply chain; - costs arising from our warranty obligations; - insufficient insurance coverage; - costs arising from unauthorized use of, or disputes involving, our proprietary technology; - our ability to effectively manage our growth into new geographies; - our exposure to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations; - impairment losses resulting from potential declines in the fair value of our assets; - costs arising from legal and arbitration proceedings; - our dependence on our experienced senior management team, who would be difficult to replace; - market perceptions regarding the instability of the euro and the possible introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone; - risks associated with our ultimate principal shareholder’s interests being inconsistent with our own; - our significant leverage, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business; and - risks associated with our structure and the terms of the Notes and other indebtedness. These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry or the regulatory regimes under which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements.

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are the leading provider of monitored alarm solutions for residential households and small businesses in Europe. We offer premium monitored alarm services to our portfolio of over 3.6 million customers (as of September 30, 2020) and design, sell and install alarms with network connectivity across 16 countries in Europe and Latin America. Our management estimates, based on third party data, that as of September 30, 2020, we were the leading provider in all ten of our top ten geographies. Our management also estimates that, on a weighted-average basis and based on our number of customers at the end of 2019, we benefit from a relative size advantage of 2.0 times across the totality of our geographies, 2.8 times across our top ten geographies and 3.0 times in our top five geographies. Since our company was founded in 1988, we have continually expanded our customer base, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17% from 2000 to December 2019. As of September 30, 2020, residential households comprised 80% of our customers, while small businesses accounted for the remaining 20%. Based on historical trends, we currently estimate that our residential customers remain with us, on average, for 15 years and our small business customers remain with us, on average, for more than 7 years. As a result, we believe that our Portfolio Services revenues (representing 82.2% of our total revenue for the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, and 81.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019) provide us with a high-margin, stable source of recurring cash flow. For the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, we generated revenue of €2,091.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €833.7 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenue of €1,900.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €702.9 million. We operate a subscription-based service business, which we conduct through two primary operating segments: - **Portfolio Services. Our Portfolio Services segment provides monitoring services to our over 3.6 million customers as of September 30, 2020 for a monthly subscription fee. We typically enter into self-renewing monitoring agreements with our customers at the time of installation, and the majority of our customers pay via direct debit. We then monitor our installed base of alarms through 20 dedicated monitoring centers located throughout Europe and Latin America to verify triggered alarms and initiate an appropriate response. We also provide customer service, maintenance and technical support for all our installed systems. We have a strong track record in customer retention, with an attrition rate of 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. This strong retention rate contributes to the stable and recurring cash flow that the segment generates, allowing us to fund investments that grow our customer base. For the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, our Portfolio Services segment generated revenue of €1,719.4 million (representing 82.2% of our total revenue) and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,255.0 million (representing a 73.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin). - **Customer Acquisition. Our Customer Acquisition segment develops, sources, purchases, provides and installs alarm systems for new customers in return for an upfront sales and installation fee. This installation fee typically only covers a portion of the costs associated with marketing, selling, purchasing equipment and installing each alarm system. As a result, the segment represents an upfront investment (which we partly expense and partly capitalize) in our business to acquire new customers. These new customers then become part of our Portfolio Services segment, driving revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and profitability growth. Due to the discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition activities, we are able to increase our marketing, sales and installation investment activities to grow our customer base, or, alternatively, reduce our investment in such activities to manage our cash on hand, over the short to medium term. Additionally, we classify certain non-core business under our Adjacencies segment, which mainly represents the sale of remote monitoring and assistance devices and services for senior citizens in our Spanish market and, starting in 2020, the sale of connected cameras under the Arlo brand in Europe. We offer a range of alarm systems with a variety of features, ranging from simple break-in detectors to more complex alarms with premium features, such as sophisticated cameras, home environment monitoring capabilities, smoke detectors, and two-way audio communication solutions. These alarm systems are directly 1 ----- connected to our monitoring centers, as well as to our customers through our web-based “MyPages” application and our mobile Verisure App, available on Apple iOS, Android and Microsoft-based smartphones. These applications allow our customers to set, monitor and control various alarm functions and settings. We primarily market under the Verisure and Securitas Direct brands, under which we have developed and launched an innovative line of products, which represent our newest technology and most advanced features (including our Verisure App). In all of the countries into which we have most recently expanded, we market exclusively under the Verisure brand.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Operating Geographies,9.2.1,,"We have alarm monitoring operations in twelve European countries (Spain, Sweden, France, Norway, Portugal, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany) and four Latin American countries (Chile, Brazil, Peru and Argentina). Residential households accounted for 80% of our customers, while small businesses accounted for 20% as of September 30, 2020. Since we first began operations, we have pursued a primarily organic growth strategy when expanding into new geographies, including Peru, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and, in 2019, Argentina, complemented by selective add-on acquisitions to enhance our position in existing countries. We have added approximately 150,000 customers since 2013 through a series of add-on acquisitions in Brazil (a 90% stake in TeleAtlantic in July 2014 and TeleAlarme in October 2017), Chile (a small portfolio in May 2014), Sweden (Alert Alarm in May 2015), France (MediaVeil in July 2015), Spain (SegurControl in July 2015), Norway (NorAlarm in May 2016 and Falck Norway in September 2016) and Denmark (Falck Denmark in September 2016). None of those add-on acquisitions involved a portfolio of more than 50,000 customers at the time of the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our History,9.3.1,,"We were founded in Sweden in 1988 as a division of Securitas AB, initially focusing on the Swedish residential home security market segment. Within our first ten years of operations, we had expanded our platform internationally, entering the home security market segments of Norway, Denmark, Finland, Spain and France, with subsequent expansion into Portugal in 2001 and Belgium and the Netherlands in 2002. In September 2006, we separated from Securitas AB and were listed on the OMX Stockholm Nordic Exchange, before being taken private in an acquisition by EQT Holdings AB in 2008. In 2009, we entered Latin America by establishing operations in Chile, followed by entry into Brazil in 2011. We were acquired by Bain Capital and H&F in 2011. Between 2012 and 2015 we opened operations in Peru, Italy and the United Kingdom. We began operations in Germany in November 2018 and in Argentina in July 2019. In late 2015, H&F acquired Bain Capital’s stake as part of the 2015 Acquisition, placing it in a majority shareholder position alongside Company management. In July 2017, H&F sold approximately 9.4% of its stake in the Group to Eiffel and in January 2019, H&F further sold approximately 12.5% of its stake in the Group to Eiffel. In April 2019, H&F sold approximately 7.5% of its stake in the Group to Alba. Throughout our recent history a portion of our equity has consistently been held by our broad management team, whose interests are thus closely linked to the interests of our investors. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the broad management team owned an approximate 11.1% stake in the Company. In June 2017, as part of a project to further evolve the company’s operating model, strategic innovation, operational integration and access to talent, we moved our group headquarters from Malmö, Sweden to Geneva, Switzerland, in the heart of our European footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strong Market Segment Leadership Positions in Europe and Latin America,9.5.1,Favorable market dynamics with low penetration rates and significant differentiation,"Low penetration rates We believe that there is substantial potential for further penetration of residential monitored alarms in Europe, which we anticipate will continue to provide us with profitable growth opportunities. Residential monitored alarm penetration rates remain relatively low in the market segments in which we operate. For example, Western Europe and the United States have roughly the same addressable market segment; however, penetration rates in Western Europe are approximately 4 times lower than in the United States. According to third-party data and our estimates, the average penetration of residential dwellings and business premises with monitored alarms in 2019 is estimated to be approximately 4% in Western Europe, compared to approximately 19% in the more-developed U.S. market. Furthermore, there is significant potential for further penetration of monitored alarms in our existing markets. For example, based on third-party data and our estimates, in all of our existing geographies the addressable market segment was approximately 127 million locations compared to approximately 83 million locations in the United States, with a penetration rate of less than 10% (or approximately 12 million locations) compared to approximately 41% (or approximately 34 million locations) in the United States. In 2019, the total number of locations (business and residential households) in our existing geographies was approximately 352 million, comprising approximately 35 million businesses and approximately 317 million residential households, compared to approximately 177 million in the United States, made up of approximately 32 million businesses and approximately 144 million residential households. Penetration rates across the total number of locations in our existing geographies in 2019 was less than 4% compared to approximately 19% in the United States. We are present in all large Western European countries including Germany where we began operations in November 2018. Within Europe, 5 of the 12 countries in which we currently have operations have average penetration rates below the Western European average. 4 ----- Source: Company estimates and third-party data. We believe that there is not a permanent structural gap between Western Europe and the United States in terms of the residential monitored security market segment and that Western Europe offers significant headroom to grow. Additionally, we believe we are uniquely positioned to reach the untapped potential customer-base in the Western European market. We believe that the primary driver of the different penetration rates between the United States and Europe is historically lower marketing spending and commercial presence in Europe and, as a result, lower consumer awareness of the benefits of security systems. As we have focused on increasing product awareness, through our GTM model, our European operations have shown strong growth. From December 2009 to September 30, 2020, we grew our subscriber base in Europe from approximately 1.2 million to over 3.6 million. Source: Company estimates and third-party data. 5 ----- Therefore, we believe the European market segment for monitored security is structurally attractive and we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of future business growth opportunities. Our larger scale, sophisticated GTM model and ability to access innovations will continue to enable us to reap the benefits of the structurally attractive European market segment. _Significant market know-how in an industry with scope for differentiation_ We believe that there is significant scope for differentiation in the alarm monitoring business. - First, market participants need to gain awareness and brand trust among customers in order to be given permission to monitor customers’ families and assets. This not only requires an established presence in the market but also a balance between lead generation and maintaining a high-density sales force. The GTM model requires interplay of customized products, brand, recruitment, training, lead generation and allocation, which we believe is highly complex to build and operate. We also seek to tailor our approach to the countries where we operate in order to deliver differentiated service to our customers that indicates comprehensive understanding of cultural norms and communities. - Second, we believe that scale, including on a regional basis, is a differentiating factor in the alarm monitoring market segment. Scale provides avenues for increased investment in innovative product and service features, greater customization of products to fit GTM efforts, enhanced monitoring and response service and the ability to drive operating leverage on fixed and semi-fixed cost structure. - Third, the demands of customer safety and well-being drives significantly higher service level requirements than in many other subscription-based businesses, which we are able to address through deep customer know-how, our 20 monitoring center locations and our sizeable sales force. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these market dynamics owing to our established and leading competitive position, our strength of brand and reputation, our scale and density of operations, our differentiated GTM model with experienced face-to-face salespeople, our technology and our diversified customer base.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strong Market Segment Leadership Positions in Europe and Latin America,9.5.2,Subscription business with diversified and high quality customer base with strong retention,"_Highly integrated business model with full control over our value chain_ We have a geographically diversified portfolio of over 3.6 million customers as of September 30, 2020. Our focus on regions throughout Europe, including the Nordics and Southern Europe, as well as certain geographies in Latin America, helps mitigate the risks of localized economic downturns. We focus on residential homes and small businesses, offering differentiated security services and products, which has resulted in a high recurring revenue. We additionally benefit from relationships with police and fire departments, which allow us to provide exceptional service to our customers, bolstering our levels of customer trust and loyalty. Our residential customers tend to be middle-to-higher-income households with assets to protect and lower price sensitivity. The resilience of the demand for our security systems is underpinned by the strength and reputation of our brand and the nature of the services we offer, as we address the safety of our customers’ families and property, and we believe customers view our solutions as less discretionary than other expenditures. As such, we believe that customers are less prone to cancel our services during economic downturns. Consequently, we currently estimate that our residential customers, which represented 80% of our total customers as of September 30, 2020, have an expected subscription life of, on average, 15 years. We are a vertically-integrated company that benefits from a differentiated product and service offering. We capitalize upon our expertise in both traditional and digital media marketing, which we believe provide us with strong lead-generation when engaging potential new customers. Furthermore, we can invest significant resources in product development to drive the introduction of new technologies and features into our alarm systems which helps upselling, enhances subscribers’ engagement and experience and, as a result, reduces attrition. As a result of our efforts, we have been successful in introducing new products and technologies to enhance our value proposition to our customers such as our Seniors and Guardian offerings (in Spain), anti-jamming (in Spain, Portugal and France) and compact and affordable vision-impairment smoke-releasing devices (in Spain since June 2017, the United Kingdom and France since 2018, and Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Chile, Norway and Belgium during 2019 and 2020). As a result of our high level of engagement with customers and our industry-leading product and service offering, we reap the benefits of high customer advocacy and the high-quality referrals generated by our existing subscriber base, which enables us to consistently grow our business. Our growth strategy is supported by our execution at a local level of a tried and tested set of competencies, as well as by leveraging our industry know-how at an 6 ----- international level by operating in a range of geographies at different stages of their expansion lifecycle. We also supplement our growth strategy through strategic alliances and accretive tuck-in acquisitions, which allow us to grow our business through multiple pathways. _Industry leading customer retention_ In addition to our diversified, high quality customer base, we have the lowest rate of customer attrition amongst our industry peers (as shown in the chart below based on a representative sample of other consumer subscription businesses), with an attrition rate of 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, which we define as the number of terminated subscriptions to our monitoring service in the year, divided by the average number of subscribers over the year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strong Market Segment Leadership Positions in Europe and Latin America,9.5.3,,"Source: Company information and third party data We estimate, based on available industry data, that we are approximately 5.7 times larger than our next largest competitor in the monitored alarm segment in Europe based on estimated subscriber count as of September 2020. We believe our leading position in the geographies where we operate in the monitored alarm segment is due to our differentiated business model. We offer premium monitored alarm services that include high quality products tailored to the residential and small business market segments. In 2019, within our market segments, we were the largest player in nine out of ten of our largest operating countries by subscribers count, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Italy and Brazil, in which we held a RGS (compared to our nearest competitors) of 5.8 times, 2.2 times, 1.4 times, 1.7 times, 1.4 times, 4.2 times, 1.8 times, 2.9 times and 1.9 times, respectively. We also estimate that during 2020 we became the largest player in France, with a RGS of 1.0 times. Most of our traditional competitors have small local or national portfolios, the largest of which have between 250,000 and 550,000 customers. We also believe our position is further strengthened by high brand awareness in our largest geographies, and plan to use our leading position and expertise to drive future growth into new geographies. We dedicate significant resources to marketing, advertising and selling activities to further grow brand awareness and our subscriber base. For example, management estimates that our sales force in Spain of approximately 3,600 full-time employees, as of September 2020, is approximately three times larger than that of our closest competitor in monitored alarm services. Our sales force, in addition to having the advantage of being larger in size than those of our competitors, also benefits from what we believe to be industry-leading training and a sales method that we continually refine and improve in order to best serve our customers. We 3 ----- believe that the depth and scale of our activities provide us with a significant advantage in competing for talented employees, by allowing us to offer a leading, growing and international career platform. We are the driving force behind the growth of the residential monitored alarm segment in the regions in which we operate. In 2019, we estimate that we represented approximately 60% of the net subscriber growth in such regions. We have been able to grow our subscriber base every year since 2000, from approximately 170,000 to over 3.3 million as of December 31, 2019, which is a CAGR of approximately 17%. We believe that our scale, along with the differentiation provided by our brand trust and awareness, sales force coverage and direct go-to-market (“GTM”) model (wherein our large network of field sales representatives meet potential customers face-to-face), our focus on innovation and our ability to attract talented employees, have resulted in a track record of above-market growth in certain of our geographies. For example, in Spain from 2008 to 2019, we grew the number of our customers at a CAGR of 7.4% compared to an estimated 2% for all other market participants (based on third-party data), while in France during that same period we grew our customer base at a CAGR of 20% compared to 4% for all other market participants (based on third party data). Further, our ability to grow our subscriber base has resulted in an increase in our share of supply relative to our competitors across the residential monitored alarm segment as a whole. We estimate that our market segment share, in our 2019 geographies, grew from 17% in 2009 to 28% in 2019, representing a CAGR of our share of approximately 5%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Our deep retention know-how and on-going customer service efforts have facilitated a decrease in our attrition rates, and consequently, allowed for better revenue growth and higher and more predictable cash flow generation. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the public health measures instituted in many of the geographies in which we operate and the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19 have not had a material impact on our attrition rates, though we cannot assess whether our attrition rates will be impacted materially in the long term due to COVID-19 or otherwise.

We believe our products benefit from industry-leading innovations that provide our customers with premium security solutions for the entire spectrum of residential monitoring needs. We believe these innovations also help us secure higher price points from our customers given they support our premium service (we call this our “more-for-more” strategy) as well as promote greater customer loyalty. We are also the only European residential alarm provider to have developed an anti-jamming capability, as well as an affordable, compact, wireless and battery-operated vision-impairment smoke-releasing device (promoted under the name “ZeroVision” with the slogan “they can’t steal what they can’t see”, and launched between the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2020 in all of our countries except Peru, Brazil and Argentina), in all cases driving upselling and enhancing subscribers’ engagement and experience. In 2019, we also formed a strategic partnership with Arlo, the world’s leading innovator in the connected camera category, and acquired its European business for $54 million (approximately €48 million at then-current exchange rates). This allows us to offer connected camera services alongside our professional security proposition. We believe that Arlo’s European retail and e-commerce presence is highly complementary with our existing go-to-market structures, creating as a result what we view as the first European multi-channel go-to-market strategy for consumer security and surveillance products and services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Our management team, supported by our strong regional teams, has a successful operating history, with one co-founder still serving in a leadership role. Under their leadership we have delivered growth in customers, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our management team is a blend of new talent from the consumer and telecom industries as well as those who have significant history with the business. Our Group Chief Executive Officer, Austin Lally, now in his seventh year with the Company, has led the development of our strategic roadmap with our management team, co-founder and Sponsor, leveraging his prior experience of over 25 years in building and growing leading consumer businesses in Europe, the United States and Asia. Our co-founder Luis Gil remains involved in critical roles that support our plans for further growth, including geographic expansion. Our senior managers are deeply aligned with their co-shareholders as large shareholders themselves, and have extended this “owner-operator” culture by driving clear accountability down to every branch level in the organization. Our strong culture and strategic alignment across geographies, including sharing of best practices, is another source of competitive differentiation. 8 ----- _High level of employee engagement_ We have a high level of employee engagement, evidenced by our engagement and employee net promoter score (“eNPS”) model launched in 2016, which saw the participation of approximately 92% of our employees in 2019. In the last three years, our level of company engagement has remained very high, at around 82 points out of a possible 100, based on the arithmetic average of 9 questions designed by Willis Towers Watson to assess whether employees are engaged, enabled and energized. Even more promising, our top talent (employees with the highest performance and potential, assessed in the top cells of our talent review matrix) showed an engagement of approximately 92, for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Among other things, we believe the “sunk cost” of the installation fee is a factor behind our customer loyalty. This helps screen for more committed customers and, we believe, increases the likelihood of customers continuing to use our system over the long term. We believe that our installation fee and subscription service creates “skin in the game” and an incentive to remain a long-term customer, which in turn helps us avoid low-quality customers, since, historically, low upfront fees can be associated with higher levels of attrition. We believe that our high upfront fees well-reflect our quality proposition and give us a long-term competitive edge over competitors, who install systems for free or with a low upfront fee. Our prices are typically at a premium to our competitors’ prices. We believe our customers’ willingness to pay such premium prices is due to our high level of customer trust, leading brand name, innovative solutions, and exceptional levels of product and service content. Additionally, our premium pricing helps drive the retention of high-quality customers, as there is a willingness (and an ability) to pay for a “high security” professional service, including installation, maintenance, monitoring and response, and [24]/7 customer support.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

We believe our ability to consistently achieve growth across revenue and profitability metrics year over year will continue as we continue to achieve further penetration of the European and Latin American market segments. For example, from 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2019, on a constant currency basis, our Portfolio Services revenue increased from €110 million to €1,546 million, which is a CAGR of approximately 18%.

The profitability of our Portfolio Services segment results from its relatively low operating cost and capital expenditure requirements (in the Portfolio Services segment, capital expenditures amounted to 2.3% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020). While our subscriber growth is dependent on our Customer Acquisition segment, we have discretion when to invest in acquiring new customers to either replace cancelling customers or grow our existing subscriber base. Furthermore, a significant portion of our Customer Acquisition spend is variable in nature, including marketing investment and variable sales commissions. Our historically low attrition rate has meant that we do not need to divert significant resources towards customer replacement costs. As such, we have flexibility in how we invest the substantial cash flow generated by the Portfolio Services segment. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we invested 33% of our Adjusted EBITDA from the Portfolio Services segment to acquire new customers and used the remaining 67% of Adjusted EBITDA from the segment primarily to replace cancelled customers, service our debt, for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. If, on the other hand, we invest our additional cash flow to acquire new customers, it allows us to potentially grow our Adjusted EBITDA in the long term. As a result of the discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition spend, we are able to efficiently manage our growth, reducing our costs and capital expenditure requirements and allowing us to use additional cash flow for debt service requirements or other purposes. For example, as lockdowns were instituted in many of the countries in which we operate as a result of COVID-19, which made customer acquisition challenging, we took decisive steps to reduce our costs, including reducing marketing spending and temporarily suspending a portion of our field sales force. During the month of June, as governments began or continued to relax lockdown restrictions, we increased our commercial activity and progressively brought back our field sales force. In the three months ended September 30, 2020, cash flow from operating activities increased to €311 million due to an increase in profitability from the three months ended June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

For Argentina, considered a hyperinflation economy, a monthly average FX has been used (EUR/ARS 80.20 for September 2020). In late 2014, we began a group-wide operational improvement plan, FOG, with the aim of optimizing our cost structure and improving productivity, which is still ongoing and has now become embedded in our culture. The program seeks to leverage our scale and share best practices across our global footprint in order to reduce costs and improve our margins. We have, since the program’s implementation, monitored the obtained savings through the implementation of a diligent bottom-up process with quarterly reporting to country and Group management teams. The actual savings in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 exceeded €35 million, obtained through development and sharing of best practices in our alarm monitoring, customer care and maintenance departments as well as our Group-wide procurement departments’ ability to leverage our size and negotiation power to obtain reduced prices across our main cost buckets. We expect that our incremental cost savings for the period from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 will be at least €35 million. In recent months, we have introduced a new detailed bottom-up cost savings plan comprised of approximately 80 global initiatives and over 600 initiatives at the local level, which we believe will enable us to achieve targeted gross aggregate cost savings of over €200 million between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2025. _Resilient performance during economic downturns_ We have a consistent track record of profitable organic growth despite ongoing economic uncertainty in certain of our geographies. Both in Spain and Portugal, where the effects of the previous economic downturn were among the most severe in Europe, we continued to expand our operations. For example, between December 2008 and December 2010 we were able to grow our customers in Spain and Portugal by 8.4% and 48.9%, respectively despite GDP contracting by 3.6% and 1.4%, respectively. In Spain, from December 2010 to December 2013, during a period of continued economic uncertainty, we were able to grow our customers by 6.5%, while GDP fell 5.5%. Likewise, in Portugal during the same period, we were able to grow our customers by 37.6%, while GDP fell by 6.6%. 10 ----- Source: Company information and third-party data (1) Cumulative growth at constant prices Between 2007 and 2019, our subscribers in Spain and Portugal grew at a CAGR of 7.7% and 13.3%, respectively. Along with increasing the number of total customers during a period of economic uncertainty, we were also able to grow our Portfolio Services EBITDA. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-march 2020, our business has demonstrated the ability to quickly and successfully adapt to the new environment. We have continued to grow our customer base, reaching over 3.6 million customers as of September 30, 2020 (corresponding to an annual growth rate of 12% compared to September 30, 2019). Our track record of organic growth has been consistent to date. During the first nine months of the year, we increased our subscribers by over 276,000 (83,000, 38,000 and 155,000 during the first, second and third quarters of the year, respectively) while also maintaining our attrition rates largely in line with previous periods at approximately 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 despite the uncertain macroeconomic situation. _Flexible cost base can be adjusted amid an economic downturn_ Our cost base is highly variable, and in the event of an economic downturn, can be downsized. For example, in response to the economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced customer acquisition spending through a reduction in marketing expenditures and realigned remuneration and commission structures. We also temporarily suspended the employment activities of many of our field sales organization and other commercial teams. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our cost base, including both operating expenses and capital expenditures, was €1,739 million (excluding SDIs), of which approximately 62% consisted of costs from our Customer Acquisition segment (both operating expenses and capital expenditures), approximately 27% consisted of operating expenses from our Portfolio Services segment, approximately 6% consisted of general corporate capital expenditures, approximately 3% consisted of capital expenditures from our Portfolio Services segment and approximately 1% consisted of costs from our Adjacencies segment. Of the costs from our Customer Acquisition segment, approximately 39% related to cost of sales and installation, approximately 26% related to branch and central support costs, approximately 22% related to the cost of material (with limited minimum volume commitments) and approximately 13% related to marketing costs (which are fully variable and discretionary). Approximately 75% of our cost of sales and installation and branch and central support costs were salary related costs, and cost of sales and installation salary costs are largely variable and based on commissions. Operating costs from our Portfolio Services segment are also largely variable, with most of the cost varying with portfolio size, and the corporate and Portfolio Services capital expenditures are largely discretionary. 11 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

In addition to our existing countries we will continue to explore addressing new countries. When growing in “start-up” geographies (such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Argentina), we utilize the same model for expansion that has proven successful in all areas in which we operate. Our replicable expansion model serves as a blueprint for successful growth into new areas. We aim to further expand our subscriber base in these geographies in a measured manner by continuing to target potential customers who meet our customer demographics and economics criteria and by investing in our portfolio of brands. Moreover, we may consider selective acquisitions to increase our subscriber base in certain regions. We believe many of our potential customers are not yet familiar with the benefits of having a monitored alarm system. We plan to use our large face-to-face sales force, unique GTM model, strong brand and broad product offerings to continue to grow our subscriber base once the sales environment improves. Growing our subscriber base should enable us to increase our profit margins, because we will be able to benefit from the density and economies of scale of our Portfolio Services segment. Additionally, given that our average payback period (the time it takes to recover the cost of acquiring a new subscriber and installing an alarm system) is approximately 3.5 years and that we estimate that our residential customers will have subscription lives of, on average, 15 years, we believe growing our subscriber base is a strategy worth pursuing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Additionally, we are striving to implement a number of measures designed to improve efficiency by replicating best practices, particularly by implementing a culture of continuous cost improvement and building structural capabilities that support these objectives. We believe our planned implementation of future cost savings initiatives under the FOG program, which include selected cost categories of our business (portfolio operations, direct and indirect procurement spend, sales, support functions, marketing and technology spend) will further enhance our cost-savings culture by building on the gains already achieved under the FOG program. We increase our prices through a “more for more” offering by focusing on the identification of value-for-money levers we can give to our customers, ideally with low cost or executional difficulty with high perceived value. By striving for better payback times we believe we are contributing to our continuous focus on improving our “quality of growth.” These initiatives are intended to improve our performance in customer care, reduce direct material costs and operating expenses, sustainably improve product quality and enhance our business stability. Of these intiatives, two-thirds are expected to improve our EBITDA and one-third are expected to positively impact our levels of capital expenditures between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2025.

The increase in SDIs was primarily driven by an increase in one-off expenditures relating to certain 34 ----- operational improvement initiatives, costs relating to our acquisition of all commercial operations of Arlo in Europe, an increase in non-recoverable withholding tax amounts and an increase in provisions. For the last two quarters annualized, our SDIs were €105.5 million, impacted by various transition projects and COVID-19 related expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our SDIs increased €32.5 million to €60.6 million from €28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which was mainly due to (i) a provision of €36 million including legal fees relating to the NCA decision, less amounts already provided (see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Subsequent Adjustments to Certain Financial Information”), (ii) costs related to the acquisition of Arlo in the fourth quarter of 2019 and (iii) COVID-19 related exceptional costs in 2020.

This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA is included in this offering memorandum because we believe that it provides a useful measure of our results of operations; however, this measure does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA as an alternative to operating profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as measure of our results of operations or liquidity.

In late 2014, we began our first group-wide operational improvement plan, FOG, with the aim of optimizing our cost structure and improving productivity. This board and management-approved cost savings program seeks to leverage our scale and share proven best practices across our global footprint, thereby reducing costs and improving our margins. The program is implemented around three categories of initiatives since late 2014: Portfolio Operations, Indirect Spend and Direct Spend. Since late 2019 the program has been extended to also incorporate Commercial and Technology initiatives. The program is closely monitored and savings are reported quarterly at the board and management level. See “Business—Product Offerings and Product Strategy—Funding Our Growth—Cost Savings _Initiative.”_ Our ability to realize these savings on the timetable anticipated is based upon internal as well as external factors and assumptions, including, without limitation, local and macroeconomic conditions, engagement with third parties (including contract counterparties), timely launch of various requests for proposals, FX, successful training with respect to customer care efficiency initiatives, effective rollout of automation of various systems, the implementation of initiatives in daily operations, follow-ups by management and effective leverage of successful strategies across jurisdictions, among other key factors. The assumptions used in estimating our cost savings are subject to a wide variety of business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our cost savings estimates. We can provide no assurances 37 ----- that we will realize our cost savings target in the timeframe specified, if at all.

We also present below certain key operating metrics used by our management to evaluate, monitor and manage our business. None of these terms are measures of financial performance under IFRS, and so they should not be considered to be alternatives to our results of operations presented in accordance with IFRS. These terms may not be comparable to similar terms used by competitors or other companies.

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,We operate in a highly competitive industry and our results may be adversely affected by this competition.,"We face significant competition from both established and new competitors. In some instances, we compete against companies with greater local scale, easier access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer-established relationships with customers. The residential home and small business segment of the much larger security services market (the “RHSB segment”) in Europe and Latin America is fragmented and subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. As a result, within our segment, we must compete against a variety of players who use various strategies. For example, the majority of our competitors offer lower installation and lower recurring fees, generally reflecting the product quality and service levels. Likewise, existing competitors may expand their current product and service offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies more quickly, take advantage of acquisitions or devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services, than we do. Our competitors may use lower pricing to increase their customer base and win market share. Our higher installation fees as compared to our competitors could make our competitors’ offers appear more attractive to potential customers, which could have a significant effect on our ability to maintain or grow our customer base. Likewise, if our competitors charge lower ongoing monitoring fees than we do, we may have to reduce our monitoring fees or risk losing our existing customers. These competitive actions could impact our ability to attract new customers, subject us to pricing pressure or erode our existing customer portfolio, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also face potential competition from improvements in do-it-yourself (“DIY”) self-monitored systems, which, through the internet, text messages, emails or similar communications, enable consumers to monitor and control their home environment through devices that they install and monitor without third-party involvement. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in technology, as well as increased smart phone penetration, and shifts in consumer preferences towards DIY and self-monitoring could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. With respect to competition from potential new entrants, we believe that players operating in the connected home market and telecommunications market, who may have existing access and relationships with subscribers and highly recognized brands, are best situated to move into the security and safety industry. While within the connected home market, security and safety is the largest growing segment, the connected home market itself is growing quickly and covers many different products and services in segments such as utility management, entertainment, wellness management and smart appliances. If competitors in these alternative segments move into the security and safety segment of the connected home market, such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, large players in adjacent or overlapping industries, such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft, have launched smart home platforms. Such players could leverage their well-known brand names and technological superiority to enter or further expand the security and safety segment of the connected home market. For example, Google acquired Dropcam (a manufacturer of security cameras) in June 2014, and merged it with Nest (a manufacturer of smart thermostats) and has subsequently launched a DIY home alarm platform in the U.S. on that basis. Though Nest’s home alarm offering is not yet present in Europe and Google remains focused on addressing the U.S. market (for example, through its strategic alliance with U.S. security services provider ADT), Nest may launch its home alarm offering in the European market and Google may form similar alliances with European security services providers. As another example, Amazon acquired Blink in December 2017 and Ring in February 2018, and subsequently proceeded to launch a Ring Alarm product suite initially in the U.S., followed by launches in the U.K. and most European countries. Such actions could impact our ability to attract new customers, subject us to pricing pressure or erode our existing customer portfolio, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Telecommunications players have already shown significant interest in entering the security and safety market 39 ----- in Europe and Comcast has already done so successfully in the United States and Telefonica in Spain and Orange in France have both re-entered the alarm category in the past year. Given the extensive customer base of larger telecommunications players, if they are able to successfully develop security monitoring capabilities, they may be able to leverage their existing customer contacts to rapidly grow this segment of their business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Whether developed by us or otherwise, our offering of new product features can have a significant impact on a customer’s initial decision to choose our products. Likewise, the quality of our monitoring services, which heavily depend on the technology used in our security and safety systems, also plays a large role in our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Accordingly, the success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services and anticipate changing customer requirements and industry standards. We may not be able to develop or partner with third-party suppliers to gain access to technical advances before our competitors, match technological innovations made by our competitors or design systems that meet customers’ requirements. Alternatively, we may not have the financial resources required to successfully develop or implement such new technologies. If we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt to changing market conditions or customer requirements in a timely manner, we could lose existing customers, encounter trouble recruiting new customers, or become subject to increased pricing pressures. Should we experience any of these technology related challenges, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition to developing and supplying innovative products, we may need, from time to time, to phase-out outdated technologies and services.

Periods of economic downturn, particularly those impacting the housing market or consumer discretionary spending, can increase our attrition rate among existing customers. For example, customer attrition rates increased across our business in 2009 compared to 2008, which coincided with the global economic crisis. In the residential segment, a proportion of customers discontinued our service in order to reduce their recurring costs, while others moved from their homes and did not re-subscribe to our service. In the small business segment, customers were particularly impacted by the economic downturn and sought to reduce their costs or were forced to close their businesses, and thus we had a more significant increase in attrition rate in our small business portfolio compared to our residential customers. Attrition as a percentage of overall customers increased in both 2012 and 2013, which was primarily driven by enduring effects of the recession in the Spanish economy, where we have a larger proportion of small business customers compared to the rest of our segments. Small business subscriptions are more directly correlated to economic conditions. The outlook for the world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty in many of our geographies. The International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) predicts positive global growth in 2021 (an improvement over the negative global growth experienced in 2020), as the global recovery is expected to strengthen gradually over the year. The IMF expects the recovery to be characterized by persistent social distancing until health risks are addressed and the potential need for countries to renew mitigation efforts (including lockdowns) in response to infection rates. Despite the IMF’s positive outlook for global recovery in 2021, there is no assurance such recovery will occur and a renewed or future recession could lead to increases in our attrition rate and could reduce the inflow of new customers purchasing our services. Periods of economic downturn, particularly those that affect Europe, can also negatively impact our ability to sell new alarm systems. Furthermore, in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have utilized certain generally-available governmental support measures including in conjunction with the temporary suspension or part time work of a portion of our employees. Any government action relating to funds received by the Group under such governmental support measures, or actions otherwise targeted at profitable corporations (such as the introduction of additional corporate taxes to fund economic recovery), could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Group. 40 ----- Additionally, on March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom officially triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, signaling the start of a two-year period in which the United Kingdom would negotiate the terms of its exit (“Brexit”) from the European Union. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, before which the United Kingdom and the European Commission reached an agreement on the future trading relationship between the parties (the “UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement” or “TCA”). On December 30, 2020, the UK Parliament approved the European Union (Future Relationship) Bill, thereby ratifying the TCA. The TCA is subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it comes into effect and has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on the buying behavior of commercial and individual customers. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to further calls for other governments of other European Union Member States to consider withdrawal from the European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency. Such developments, or the perception that any such developments could occur, could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global economy. Any deterioration of the current economic situation in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global economy as a whole could have a negative impact on the Group’s revenues and increase the Group’s financing costs, circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,Attrition of customer accounts or failure to continue to acquire new customers in a cost effective manner could adversely affect our operations.,"The Group contracts with customers on standard terms within each country. In some countries, our customer contracts have minimum periods of duration—typically ranging from 12 to 36 months—during which cancellation fees or payments may be payable if the contract is terminated by the customer. Following the expiration of any initial minimum period, a customer may cancel a subscription on giving the requisite period of notice (typically one to three months) without payment of a cancellation fee. For residential customers, the main reasons for cancelling a subscription include factors such as moving to a new home, financial distress, or dissatisfaction with our service or prices. For small businesses, attrition is usually related to financial distress, the failure, closure or relocation of the business or dissatisfaction with our service or prices. Our overall attrition rates on a twelve-month trailing basis were 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.2% in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. As we continue to expand, including into new countries, our new customers may have different economic and other characteristics from our current customers, which may lead to increased attrition rates. While it is difficult to assess the impact that public health initiatives and the economic uncertainty as a result COVID-19 may have on our attrition rates, our subscriptionbased Portfolio Services segment has proven resilient and our attrition rates have not been materially impacted to date. Customer attrition reduces our revenues from monthly subscription fees and, to the extent we decide to invest in replacing such customers with new customers, customer attrition also increases our customer acquisition costs. Consequently, customer attrition, particularly prior to the end of the payback period (the time it takes to recapture our upfront costs) have a negative effect on our business and financial condition. If upfront customer acquisition costs increase, or if the installation fees or monthly subscription fees we charge decrease, the payback period will lengthen, increasing the negative effects that attrition may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to retain existing customers and acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner may also be affected by our customers’ selection of telecommunications services. Certain elements of our operating model rely on our customers’ selection of telecommunications services (both wireless and wired), which we use to communicate with our monitoring operations. In order to continue to service our customers, our systems need to be able to interface with the technology existing in our customers’ residences or businesses. Advances in technology may require customers to upgrade to alternative, and often more expensive, technologies to transmit alarm signals. Such higher costs may reduce the market for new customers, or increase attrition. While we generally seek to upgrade customers on a rolling basis, if a substantial number of customers were to simultaneously seek to upgrade their services, we may not be able to efficiently or effectively accommodate such requests. Additionally, in the future we may not be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies to changing market demands, and in any event we may be required to incur significant additional costs to upgrade to improved technology. Continued shifts in technology or customers’ preferences regarding telecommunications services could divert management’s attention and other important resources away from our customer service and sales efforts for new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to offer our 41 ----- services to our customers depends on the performance of these telecommunications services. In particular, we rely on them to provide our customers with constant connectivity to our alarm monitoring operations so that we can be made aware of all actual intrusions. Such telecommunications services are, however, vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including power loss, malicious human acts and may become unavailable during natural disasters. Moreover, these telecommunications services providers have the right to terminate their services under their agreements in certain circumstances and under certain conditions, some of which are outside our customers’ control. The termination of such services could impact our ability to provide our customers with the services they require, which would adversely affect the value of our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The Iberian segment accounted for 41% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. In light of this concentration, our business is particularly sensitive to developments that materially impact the Iberian economy or otherwise affect our operations in Iberia. Negative developments in, or the general weakness of, the Iberian economy may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of potential new customers, our current customers and the willingness of small businesses to make investments. We have a higher percentage of small business customers in Iberia than in our other geographies and such small business customers tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions. A recession, or public perception that economic conditions are deteriorating, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. The impact of public health measures instituted or to be instituted in Iberia as a result of COVID-19, such as lockdowns or states of alarm, could have a significant macroeconomic effect on the economic health of the region. While the impact of an economic slowdown or recession on our business in Iberia is uncertain, it could result in a decline in our revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

For example, home insurance companies (many of which offer reduced premiums for homes with security alarms), telecommunications companies or utility companies (all of which may already have a relationship with our potential customers) may decide to expand into security and safety services and bundle their existing offerings with such services. For example, Google acquired Dropcam (a manufacturer of security cameras) in June 2014, and merged it with Nest (a manufacturer of smart thermostats) and has subsequently launched a DIY home alarm platform in the U.S. on that basis. Though Nest’s home alarm offering is not yet present in Europe and Google remains focused on addressing the U.S. market (for example, through its strategic alliance with U.S. security services provider ADT), Nest may launch its home alarm offering in the European market and Google may form similar alliances with European security services providers. As another example, Amazon acquired Blink in December 2017 and Ring in February 2018, and subsequently proceeded to launch a Ring Alarm product suite initially in the U.S., followed by launches in the U.K. and most European countries. The existing access to and relationship with customers that these companies have could give them a substantial advantage over us, especially if they are able to offer customers a lower price by bundling these services. These potential competitors may subject us to increased pricing pressure, slower growth in our customer base, higher costs and increased attrition rate among our customers. If we are unable to sufficiently respond to these competitors or otherwise meet these competitive challenges, we may lose customers or experience a decrease in demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in many locations, we work with guarding companies to respond to triggered alarms. In some cases, they are also competing with us for security and safety monitoring services. If these or other guarding companies were to successfully expand or further expand into the alarm monitoring and installation market segment, they would become direct and larger competitors with us. This development could also force us to find alternative first responders in the affected regions, and such alternative first responders may not be available on a timely basis or on commercially attractive terms. The costs and difficulties associated with finding alternative providers, as well as any decrease in our share of supply in the relevant region, resulting from the presence of these companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

If we were to experience a breach of our data security, we might find ourselves in a position where personal data about our customers was at risk of exposure. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, or the misuse or distribution of other personal data, including images taken by our photo detectors and cameras, we may experience a general decline in consumer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in our attrition rate or make it more difficult to attract new customers. In addition, if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of our network, boost general consumer confidence in our business, or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, we may be required to make unplanned capital expenditures or expend other resources. Further, as we expand the automation of our services and offer increasingly centralized access for consumers through features like “Connected Home,” the potential risk associated with any form of cyberattack or data breach also increases, threatening to expose consumer data. Any such breach and associated loss of confidence in our business or additional capital expenditure requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, in most of the countries in which we operate, the processing of personal data is subject to governmental regulation and legislation.

However, our future rate of growth may slow compared to the past period. Our recent revenue growth is primarily due to the growth of our customer base and increases in our subscription fees (including some increases beyond the increase in consumer price indices, generally reflecting increased service levels). We may not be able to sustain the level of customer growth, and further increases in subscription fees may meet customer resistance and lead to increases in customer attrition rates.

Additionally, we may be forced to spend additional capital to continue to acquire customers at our present rate or, during certain periods in the future, we may seek to increase the rate at which we acquire additional customers. Either such strategy would cause us to expend additional amounts to purchase inventory and to market our products. As a result of these increased investments, our profitability would decrease. In addition, we may evaluate complementary business opportunities, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new alliances with partners to market our alarm systems. Any of these new opportunities, customer acquisition channels or alliances, such as the acquisition of all commercial operations of Arlo in Europe in 2019, could have higher cost structures than our current arrangements, which could reduce profit margins. Moreover, our customer base includes long-time legacy customers, and it is a challenge to sell additional services to such customers.

As a result, our operating costs may increase faster than our associated revenues, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In late 2014, we began a group-wide operational improvement plan, FOG, with the aim of optimizing our cost structure and improving productivity, which is still ongoing and has become embedded in our culture. The program seeks to leverage our scale and share best practices across our global footprint in order to reduce costs and improve our margins. We have, since the program’s implementation, monitored the obtained savings through the implementation of a diligent bottom-up process with quarterly reporting to country and Group management teams. The actual savings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 exceeded €35 million, obtained through development and sharing of best practices in our alarm monitoring, customer care and maintenance departments, as well as our Group-wide procurement departments’ ability to leverage our size and negotiation power to obtain reduced prices for our largest costs. In recent months, we have introduced a new detailed bottom-up cost savings plan comprised of approximately 80 global initiatives and over 600 initiatives at the local level, which we believe will enable us to achieve targeted gross aggregate cost savings of over €200 million between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2025. We expect that our incremental cost savings for the period from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 will be at least €35 million, which represents amounts in excess of what is already reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA for the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized.

Our reputation may be harmed either through product defects, such as the failure of one or more of our alarm systems, or shortfalls in our customer service, such as a failure to provide reliable product maintenance. Any harm done to our reputation or business relationships as a result of our actions or the actions of third parties could have a significant negative effect on us. Our relationships with our customers are of particular importance. Customers generally judge our performance through their interactions with the staff at our monitoring centers, the reliability of our products and our maintenance performance for any products that require repair. Any failure to meet our customers’ expectations in such customer service areas could have a material impact on our attrition rate or make it difficult to recruit new customers. Moreover, we may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that any of our products is alleged to contain a defect and we may incur liability costs for the entire damage or loss claimed. Any claims could divert resources from operating the business and may adversely affect our reputation with our customers as a provider of quality solutions.

If we fail to respond effectively to an alarm, our customers could be harmed, their items could be stolen or their property could be damaged. Our customer contracts and other agreements pursuant to which we sell our products and services typically contain provisions limiting our liability to customers and third parties in the event that certain failures lead to a loss due to a system failure or an inadequate response to alarm activation. However, these provisions as well as our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us from potential liability. In addition, if a claim is brought against us, these limitations may not be enforced or enforceable. Any significant or material claim related to the failure of our products or services could lead to significant litigation costs, including the payment of monetary damages, reputational damage and adverse publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

We are subject to EU and local laws, rules and regulations in the geographic regions in which we operate. These regulations govern our operations, from the sales and installation process through to the monitoring and alarm verification process. Relevant regulation for our operations include such matters as consumer protection, fair trade, country-specific security industry regulation (including with respect to hardware requirements or operational requirements), data privacy, marketing and competition law. Many European countries have regulations governing consumer sales methods such as door-to-door, telemarketing and online sales or regulations governing trial periods during which customers may request a refund if they change their mind about wanting to purchase a given product or service. In order to install an alarm system, we generally must be licensed in the country where we are installing the system. Additionally, we generally must obtain operating certificates or permits for our alarm monitoring centers, and provide specified levels of training to our employees at those centers. We are also governed by regulations relating to when we can forward alarms to emergency providers, and may in certain countries be subject to consequences if we forward false alarms to such emergency providers. Any failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations (local or otherwise) in jurisdictions in which we operate may result in fines, penalties or a suspension or termination of our right to sell, install and/or monitor alarm systems in the relevant jurisdiction. Additionally, changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or the introduction of new EU regulation could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses to comply with such laws or regulations, or become unable to operate in the alarm sale, installation or monitoring market segment within the localities in 46 ----- which such laws or regulations are implemented, or could impact our sales channels. Such changes may also result in delays in commencement or completion of services for our customers or the need to modify completed installations. For example, the New Deal for Consumers adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council on April 18, 2019 (the “EU Directive”) may result in national legislation restricting door to door sales practices and may require us to change our sales approach with potential customers. The implementation of the EU Directive is likely to vary across our countries of operation.

These measures could include, among other things: - requiring permits for the installation and monitoring of individual alarm systems and the revocation of such permits following a specified number of false alarms; - imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to alarms at a particular location after a specified number of false alarms; - requiring further verification of an alarm signal before the police will respond; and - subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for transmitting false alarms. Enactment of such measures could adversely affect our costs and our ability to conduct our activities. For example, concern over false alarms in localities adopting these ordinances could cause a decrease in the timeliness of emergency responders. As a result, consumers may be discouraged from purchasing or maintaining a monitored alarm system. In addition, some local governments impose fines, penalties and limitations on either customers or the alarm companies for false alarms. Our alarm service contracts generally allow us to pass these charges on to customers. However, if more local governments impose fines or penalties, or if local governments increase existing requirements, our customers may find these additional charges prohibitive and be discouraged from using monitored alarm services. If the adoption of such ordinances reduces the demand for our products or services or if we are unable to pass related assessments, fines and penalties on to our customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Our suppliers’ abilities to meet our needs are subject to various risks, including political and economic stability, natural calamities, health epidemics or pandemics, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. We are therefore susceptible to the interruption of supply or the receipt of faulty products from our suppliers. Difficulties encountered with suppliers may result in disruptions to our operations, loss of profitability and damage to our reputation, and in such instances our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. See “Any disruption to the communities in which we operate, or in which _our suppliers operate, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our ability to increase our customer base at the same rate, maintain the same low levels of attrition, deliver uninterrupted high quality services to our customers or source the products needed for our operations and may therefore adversely affect our business.” For example, if suppliers for key components fail to deliver products or experience delays in delivery,_ such difficulties may prevent us from upgrading equipment, delivering products to our customer on time, or otherwise hinder our ability to install and upgrade systems and provide replacement parts. This could result in higher costs to us and a potential decline in confidence in our products and services among our customers. We are particularly vulnerable to any disruptions in supply of our legacy systems or replacement parts for these systems, as these products may become obsolete and may be out of production. Across the Group, we have a number of critical components in our systems where we have a single supplier, which subjects us to a higher risk of interrupted supply. We also must meet minimum purchase commitments with certain suppliers, which may require us to hold inventory in excess of our requirements or to buy volumes beyond actual demand where demand falls below expectations. For example, in 2008, as the economy slowed significantly, so did the demand for our products and we were required to purchase and hold excess inventory to meet our minimum purchase requirements. 47 ----- We also often partner with key suppliers to develop proprietary technologies and products used in our business. We use these partnerships to supplement our own internal product development team. If these suppliers fail to keep pace with technological innovations in the RHSB segment, we may incur increased product development costs or lose customers to competitors with access to these technological innovations. Any interruption in supply, failure to produce quality products or inability to keep pace with technological innovation by a key supplier could adversely affect our operations, as it may be difficult for us to find alternatives on terms acceptable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Therefore, we may be liable for defects in our suppliers’ component parts that manifest after the term of the manufacturer’s warranty expires. Further, our suppliers’ warranties also have limitations on the extent of their liability for repairs or replacements. Additionally, we may encounter situations where we believe a product is defective, but the manufacturer may not honor the warranty either because they do not agree that the product is defective or because the manufacturer has financial difficulties.

As such, our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us against liability from the hazards and risks related to our business. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at rates we consider reasonable.

We use our in-house development team to design proprietary products, including hardware and software protocols. We also cooperate with our network of manufacturing partners to jointly develop new and share patents for proprietary products and solutions. While we are increasingly seeking patent protection covering such proprietary technologies, the legal protections covering our proprietary technologies from infringement or other misuse may be inadequate. Likewise, the remedy for any breach of such protections may not be adequate to compensate us for the damages suffered. Any access to or use by competitors of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be subject to claims of patent or other intellectual property rights infringement by third parties. In developing technologies and systems, we may not adequately identify third-party intellectual property rights or assess the scope and validity of these third-party rights. Accordingly, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others and seeking that we cease to use the relevant technology. Intellectual property litigation could adversely affect the development or sale of the challenged product or technology or require us to pay damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Expanding into these geographies involves significant expenditures, over a period of several years, on development of monitoring and backup centers, hiring and training of personnel, and marketing efforts to introduce our brand to the new geography. We may not accurately predict such costs or accurately anticipate 48 ----- operational difficulties caused by local conditions, and therefore may not achieve our financial and strategic objectives for our operations in the new geographies. Accordingly, we may incur losses as we expand our operations. Some examples of the risks encountered in entering new regions include: - costs associated with signing up customers who may not prove as loyal as our current customer base, which would cause our attrition rate to increase; - increased investment associated with understanding new geographies and following trends in these areas in order to effectively compete; - increased costs associated with adapting our products and services to different requirements in the local markets areas, which may decrease our margins and profitability; - challenges relating to developing and maintaining appropriate, and risk of non-compliance with, risk management and internal control structures for operations in new geographies and understanding and complying with new regulatory schemes; - reduced ability to predict our performance because we will have less experience in the new geographies than in our existing geographies; - trade barriers such as export requirements, which could cause us to experience inventory shortages or an inability to offer our full set of products; - tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries; - currency effects, such as future currency devaluations; and - political, regulatory and other local risks. When we enter into acquisitions, such as the acquisition of all commercial operations of Arlo in Europe in 2019, we expect such acquisitions will result in various benefits. However, achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business we acquire can be operated in the manner in which we intend. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits and synergies could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of revenues generated by the combined business and diversion of management’s time and energy. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we cannot exclude that, in spite of the due diligence we perform, we will not inadvertently or unknowingly acquire actual or potential liabilities or defects, including legal claims, claims for breach of contract, employment-related claims, environmental liabilities, conditions or damage, hazardous materials or liability for hazardous materials or tax liabilities. We may also become subject to national or international antitrust investigations in connection with any acquisitions or otherwise. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Both our failure to accurately predict or manage costs or any operational difficulties we encounter in expanding into new geographies, and our failure to accurately anticipate or capture expected benefits from our add-on acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro into euro at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of certain other currencies (the Swedish krona (SEK) and Norwegian krone (NOK) in particular) against the euro may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. Our primary exposure is to the SEK and NOK. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 68% of our revenue was denominated in euro, 20% was denominated in SEK and NOK and 12% of revenue was denominated in other currencies. Historically, the euro/SEK exchange rate fluctuated significantly, as it averaged SEK 9.3248 = EUR 1.0 in 2015, SEK 9.4648 = EUR 1.0 in 2016, SEK 9.6464 = EUR 1.0 in 2017, SEK 10.2937 = EUR 1.0 in 2018, SEK 10.5824 = EUR 1.0 in 2019, and SEK 10.5779 = EUR 1.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Foreign exchange rate fluctuations can significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. In addition, certain of our supply contracts in non-euro denominated countries contain clauses that reset the prices at which we buy our goods based on fluctuations in exchange rates, which can increase our costs if rates move in a manner that is unfavorable to us. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations and any unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates, including as a result of the devaluation of a currency in a particular country we operate in, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

In particular, we are dependent on a small group of experienced senior executives. There can be no assurance that we will continue to attract or retain the qualified personnel needed for our business. Competition for qualified senior managers, as well as research and development personnel, in our industry is intense and there is limited availability of persons with the relevant experience. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience a delay or higher labor costs in order to attract and retain qualified managers and personnel from time to time. Also, our business model is specific and differentiated. So, we need to ensure new personnel have the time and training to become fully effective.

If such an event were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized market dislocation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, especially as our operations are primarily in Europe. Such unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of customers and, as a result, it may, among others, be more (i) difficult for us to attract new customers, (ii) likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (iii) difficult for us to maintain ARPU at existing levels. Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, operating cash flow, operating cash flow margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro such as supply contracts would be determined by laws in effect at such time.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or synergies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then-outstanding amount under the Senior Credit Facilities and 53 ----- the Existing Senior Secured Notes. At the maturity of the New Senior Credit Facilities (including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Senior Term Loan, which both mature or will mature before the Senior Notes), the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on any series of Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the New Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2020 Senior Facilities Agreement, limit or will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

The SEK Senior Notes, the Existing Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or STIBOR, as applicable, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Indentures, the New Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2020 Senior Facilities Agreement do not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of inter-bank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR and STIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and STIBOR. In addition, EURIBOR, STIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are or may be the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in 54 ----- the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or STIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the SEK Senior Notes, the Existing Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities whose interest rates are or will be linked to EURIBOR and STIBOR as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or STIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if STIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Senior Notes Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate comparable to STIBOR, which upon certification (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) by the Senior Notes Issuer of such rate to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the SEK Senior Notes (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) without any further action or consent by the noteholders or the Trustee. This means that interest on the SEK Senior Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the SEK Senior Notes issued on the Issue Date.

Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional senior indebtedness, any such additional debt incurred may be substantial and would rank senior in right of payment to the Senior Note Guarantees. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Senior Note Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of such senior indebtedness of such Senior Note Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Senior Note Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Note Guarantee. Until the senior indebtedness of such Senior Note Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Senior Note Guarantor. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Senior Note Guarantor, holders of senior debt of such Senior Note Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of such Senior Note Guarantee. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement contains significant restrictions with respect to payments of the Senior Notes, including payments by the Senior Notes Issuer, following an acceleration event under a prior ranking finance agreement. If there is a payment default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the New Senior Facilities Agreement or the 2020 Senior Facilities Agreement, or if a payment stop notice is issued following an event of default other than non-payment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the New Senior Facilities Agreement or the 2020 Senior Facilities Agreement, then payments will not be permitted to be made in respect of the Senior Notes until the expiration of the applicable payment stop notice. In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on the Senior Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders would be required to turn over such payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the holders of the Senior Notes are generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Senior Notes Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, nevertheless the Intercreditor Agreement places certain limits on enforcement. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Permitted Payments.” In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note Guarantees provide: - for customary turnover provisions by the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior debt of the Senior Note Guarantors; - that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Senior Note Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, such Senior Note Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Note Guarantee until such default is cured or waived; - that if any other event of default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness and the Senior Notes Trustee receives a notice of such event of default, such Senior Note Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Note Guarantee, until (amongst others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and - that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the agent for the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such Senior Note Guarantee, except in certain circumstances. The Senior Notes Indenture also provides and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the applicable Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture 60 ----- and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantor and by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.

The Indentures provide that the Guarantees and the Security Documents provide that the security interests, will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or in respect of which security interests may be granted by the relevant Guarantor or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest, as it relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law. See “Insolvency _Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In addition, enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors or security providers in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, set-off, counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or grantor of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee or security interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void any Guarantee or any security interest, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the granting of the Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the granting of the relevant Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or - the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or enforcement proceeds under the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; 61 ----- - the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over the Collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuers, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void. Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent (or, in favor of the holders of the Notes, as represented by the Security Agent, as applicable), including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain time period following the pledge or charge. In some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Spain, France and Portugal, procedural and administrative proceedings, including proceedings for enforcement and insolvency, have been suspended or delayed. This may hinder your ability to enforce your rights in the Collateral or to launch insolvency proceedings.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, a security interest may not in all circumstances have priority over a security interest granted over the same Collateral on a later date.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest and be under a fiduciary duty to protect the interest of the pledgor.

If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Senior Notes Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Senior Notes (due to, for instance, to an ongoing default or Event of Default under the Existing Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Credit Facilities), we may seek the consent of the debt holders under such indebtedness to such provision or may attempt to refinance the indebtedness that contain such prohibition, but may be unable to obtain consent or to refinance such indebtedness and would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Senior Notes. Future indebtedness of the Issuers or its subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a change of control. The change of control provision contained in each of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indentures. The definition of “change of control” contained in each of the Indentures includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “substantially all” of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the relevant Issuer would be required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant series of Notes. Additionally, an enforcement of the share pledge over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could constitute a “change of control” under each of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Insolvency proceedings with respect to companies in each of these countries would likely be governed by local law. However, they could be required to proceed under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the company has its “centre of main interests,” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interests” will be in the jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this presumption is not conclusive. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies may proceed under, and be governed by Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Danish or Swiss laws or potentially by the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the centre of main interests of those companies is determined to be in such other jurisdiction at the relevant time. The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as those of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar. See “Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and _the Collateral” for a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal,_ France, Denmark and Switzerland. In the event that the Issuers, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Guarantees and Collateral which may be provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the Guarantees or Collateral after a bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, or could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees and limit any amounts that you may receive. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurances that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the collateral. 68 ----- If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French authorities which must render a decision within two months of receipt of a filing which is deemed complete by the French authorities (failing which authorization shall be deemed to have been granted).

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are the leading provider of monitored alarm solutions for residential households and small businesses in Europe. We offer premium monitored alarm services to our portfolio of over 3.6 million customers (as of September 30, 2020) and design, sell and install alarms with network connectivity across 16 countries in Europe and Latin America. Our management estimates, based on third party data, that as of September 30, 2020, we were the leading provider in all ten of our top ten geographies. Our management also estimates that, on a weighted-average basis and based on our number of customers at the end of 2019, we benefit from a relative size advantage of 2.0 times across the totality of our geographies, 2.8 times across our top ten geographies and 3.0 times in our top five geographies. Since our company was founded in 1988, we have continually expanded our customer base, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17% from 2000 to December 2019. As of September 30, 2020, residential households comprised 80% of our customers, while small businesses accounted for the remaining 20%. Based on historical trends, we currently estimate that our residential customers remain with us, on average, for 15 years and our small business customers remain with us, on average, for more than 7 years. As a result, we believe that our Portfolio Services revenues (representing 82.2% of our total revenue for the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, and 81.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019) provide us with a high-margin, stable source of recurring cash flow. For the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, we generated revenue of €2,091.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €833.7 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenue of €1,900.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €702.9 million. We operate a subscription-based service business, which we conduct through two primary operating segments: - **Portfolio Services. Our Portfolio Services segment provides monitoring services to our over 3.6 million customers as of September 30, 2020 for a monthly subscription fee. We typically enter into self-renewing monitoring agreements with our customers at the time of installation, and the majority of our customers pay via direct debit. We then monitor our installed base of alarms through 20 dedicated monitoring centers located throughout Europe and Latin America to verify triggered alarms and initiate an appropriate response. We also provide customer service, maintenance and technical support for all our installed systems. We have a strong track record in customer retention, with an attrition rate of 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. This strong retention rate contributes to the stable and recurring cash flow that the segment generates, allowing us to fund investments that grow our customer base. For the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, our Portfolio Services segment generated revenue of €1,719.4 million (representing 82.2% of our total revenue) and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,255.0 million (representing a 73.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin). - **Customer Acquisition. Our Customer Acquisition segment develops, sources, purchases, provides and installs alarm systems for new customers in return for an upfront sales and installation fee. This installation fee typically only covers a portion of the costs associated with marketing, selling, purchasing equipment and installing each alarm system. As a result, the segment represents an upfront investment (which we partly expense and partly capitalize) in our business to acquire new customers. These new customers then become part of our Portfolio Services segment, driving revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and profitability growth. Due to the discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition activities, we are able to increase our marketing, sales and installation investment activities to grow our customer base, or, alternatively, reduce our investment in such activities to manage our cash on hand, over the short to medium term. 76 ----- Additionally, we classify certain non-core business under our Adjacencies segment, which mainly represents the sale of remote monitoring and assistance devices and services for senior citizens in our Spanish market and, starting in 2020, the sale of connected cameras under the Arlo brand in Europe. We offer a range of alarm systems with a variety of features, ranging from simple break-in detectors to more complex alarms with premium features, such as sophisticated cameras, home environment monitoring capabilities, smoke detectors, and two-way audio communication solutions. These alarm systems are directly connected to our monitoring centers, as well as to our customers through our web-based “MyPages” application and our mobile Verisure App, available on Apple iOS, Android and Microsoft-based smartphones. These applications allow our customers to set, monitor and control various alarm functions and settings. We primarily market under the Verisure and Securitas Direct brands, under which we have developed and launched an innovative line of products, which represent our newest technology and most advanced features (including our Verisure App). In all of the countries into which we have most recently expanded, we market exclusively under the Verisure brand.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

While we believe we have a resilient business model as compared to other industries, during periods of economic downturn, we have experienced higher attrition rates than during periods of economic growth in some regions. As customers seek to minimize their expenses, we may determine that more should be spent on marketing and sales per new customer, which may, in turn, increase our CPA. Economic downturns have historically impacted our small business customers more than our residential customers, as certain types of small businesses can often cut spending or can be more likely to go out of business during economic downturns. Conversely, improving economic conditions tend to be correlated with declining attrition rates. Our overall attrition rates, on a twelve-month rolling basis were 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.2% in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. While the COVID-19 outbreak has had, and continues to have, a material impact on business around the world and the economic environments in which they operate, it is too early to assess whether it will have a material impact on our future.

However, the average retention life of our residential customers is typically about twice as long as that of our small business customers. Factors that impact our customer mix include our marketing focus and desire to grow our business with different types of customers in different regions and general economic conditions, which tend to cause more fluctuations in renewal rates among our small business customers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Annual price increases in line with consumer price indices or cost development are generally provided for in our customer contracts. Further, our pricing levels are impacted by our ability to drive the introduction of new technologies and features to enhance our value proposition to customers. Our ability to maintain high customer satisfaction levels with respect to our products and services and competition in our market also impact pricing. Potential increases in fees may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending on local conditions, and we have and will seek to continue to differentiate the pricing within each segment to reflect service and value proposition provided, and between residential and small business customers to compensate for the shorter life span of small business customers. Further, our pricing levels are also impacted by our ability to deliver quality products and services to our customers. From time to time over the last several years, in certain regions we have implemented price increases in excess of inflation indices without a significant impact on our attrition rate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The cost of acquiring new customers varies 77 ----- according to a number of factors, including market competition, cost development, our overall growth strategy and investments in marketing. Any increase in these costs or a reduction in our installation fees may increase the amount of time it takes for us to recoup the upfront cost of acquiring customers. At the Group level, this metric is influenced by the mix of countries at different levels of maturity and different go-to market channels. We are comfortable with the range within which we are managing the cost of acquiring new customers.

We make significant investments to grow our customer portfolio, including expenses to market our products and services and to purchase the equipment used in our security systems. We also incur costs to develop new products. Following any successful expansion of our customer portfolio, we expect to generate increased revenue from customer fees and, because our business model is scalable with costs that are semi-fixed or fixed, improvements in our profit margin. As a result, changes in our growth strategy impact our Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from operations from period to period. Our customer growth will vary based on numerous factors, including actions by competitors in our geographies, economic conditions and our growth strategy, and we may not in the future grow as rapidly as we have done in the past.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Business and Operations,17.2.6,Customer Attrition,"Our attrition rates are a key factor impacting our business, since the total sales derived by our Portfolio Services segment are directly related to the number of installed customers. We review our attrition rates in order to determine our need to acquire new customers, and thus expend funds to market our products and services and invest in new customers. Factors influencing customer attrition often differ between our customer types and regions, and to a certain extent also vary over time. For residential customers, the main reasons for cancelling a subscription include factors such as moving to a new home, financial distress or dissatisfaction with customer service or prices. For small businesses, attrition is usually related to financial distress, the failure, closure or relocation of the business or dissatisfaction with customer service or prices. Our overall attrition rate on a twelve-month trailing basis for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 was 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the public health measures instituted in many of the geographies in which we operate and the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19 have not had a material impact on our attrition rates, though we cannot assess whether our attrition rates will be impacted materially in the long term due to COVID-19 or otherwise. Our subscription-based Portfolio Services segment has proven resilient and our attrition rates have not been materially impacted to date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Business and Operations,17.2.7,Fluctuations in Exchange Rates,"We report our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro into euro at then-applicable FX. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of certain other currencies (the SEK and NOK in particular) against the euro may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. For example, a stronger euro will reduce the reported results of operations of the non-euro businesses and conversely a weaker euro will increase the reported results of operations of the non-euro businesses. Our primary exposure is to the SEK and NOK. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 68% of our revenue was denominated in euro, 20% was denominated in SEK and NOK and 12% of revenue was denominated in other currencies. Historically, the euro/SEK exchange rate fluctuated significantly. For example, the exchange rate averaged SEK 9.6464 = EUR 1.0 in 2017 and SEK 10.2937 = EUR 1.0 in 2018, SEK 10.5824 = EUR 1.0 in 2019, and SEK 10.5779= EUR 1.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. FX fluctuations can significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. In addition, certain of our supply contracts in non-euro denominated countries contain clauses that reset the prices at which we buy our goods based on fluctuations in exchange rates, which can increase our costs if rates move in a manner that is unfavorable to us. We believe that we have limited foreign exchange transaction risk as we incur costs and derive subscription fees in the local currency of our geographies. Further, although 30 % of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is denominated in non-euro currencies, the majority of our indebtedness is euro-denominated. 78 ----- We have presented in the following table certain of our financial and operating results on a constant currency basis to allow investors to compare our results of operations and certain operating metrics across periods on a like-for-like basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on financial and operating measures, we believe that evaluating these financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to management. We have removed the effects of FX changes in our discussion of certain operating and financial metrics by re-translating each period’s non-euro denominated results using a constant rate of exchange for each of the applicable currencies. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flow. These non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

To the extent the SEK/euro exchange rate varies, the euro equivalent amount due upon repayment of principal could increase. We do not presently intend to hedge our SEK exposure as a portion of our revenues are denominated in SEK. We are also permitted to incur additional debt under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2020 Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Indentures, which debt may be used to fund acquisitions or for other purposes. Our large amount of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities, since a substantial portion our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the servicing of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as some of our competitors are less leveraged. Our leverage may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business, industry or the economy in general.

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results,17.4.2,Key Operating Metrics,"Our management uses a number of key operating metrics, in addition to our IFRS financial measures, in order to evaluate, monitor and manage our business. The non-IFRS operational and statistical information related to our operations included in this section is unaudited and has been derived from internal reporting systems. Although none of these metrics are measures of financial performance under IFRS, we believe that these metrics provide important insight into the operations and strength of our business. These metrics may not be comparable to similar terms used by competitors or other companies, and from time to time we may change our definitions of these metrics. These metrics include the following: _Adjusted EBITDA. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as the result for the period before net finance costs, income_ tax expense/benefit, depreciation and amortization and retirement of assets (which relates to the retirement of installed equipment due to subscriber cancellations). _Adjusted EBITDA Before SDIs. “Adjusted EBITDA Before SDIs” is defined as the result for the period before_ net finance costs, income tax expense/benefit, depreciation and amortization, retirement of assets (which relates to the retirement of installed equipment due to subscriber cancellations) and SDIs. _Adjusted EBITDA for our segments. “Adjusted EBITDA for our segments” is defined as revenue (including_ external and internal sales) minus cost of sales (including external and internal costs) and selling and administrative expenses. Our calculation of segment Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of depreciation and amortization, retirement of assets, SDIs, financial items or income tax expense because these items are allocated at the Group level. In addition, it does not reflect eliminations due to intercompany sales. _Adjusted EBITDA Margin. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA Margin from Portfolio Services. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin from Portfolio Services” is_ calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services by revenue from Portfolio Services. _Average Revenue per User. “ARPU” is our Portfolio Services segment revenue consisting of monthly average_ subscription fees and sales of additional products and services divided by the monthly average number of customers during the relevant period. _Monthly Adjusted EBITDA per Customer. “EPC” is calculated by dividing the total monthly Adjusted EBITDA_ generated by our existing customer portfolio (which is our Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services) by the monthly average number of customers over the same period. _Cancellations. Total number of cancelled subscriptions during the period, including cancellations on acquired_ portfolios. _Attrition Rate. The attrition rate is the number of terminated subscriptions to our monitoring service in the last_ twelve months divided by the average number of customers for the last twelve months. _Cash Acquisition Cost per New Customer. Cash acquisition cost per new customer (CPA) is the net investment_ required to acquire a customer, including costs related to the marketing and sales process, installation of the alarm system, costs of alarm system products and overhead expenses for the customer acquisition process. The metric is calculated net of any revenues from installation fees charged to the customer and represents the sum of Adjusted EBITDA plus capital expenditures in our Customer Acquisition segment on average for every customer acquired. _New Customers Added (gross). Total number of new customers added. Subscriber Growth Rate. Number of subscribers at the end of the period divided by the number of customers_ from the previous period. _Payback Period. Payback period is a proxy for the time in years required to recapture the initial capital_ investment made to acquire a new customer and is calculated as CPA divided by EPC, divided by 12. The following table shows those key operating metrics for each of our segments as of and for the periods set forth below. These metrics are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that these metrics provide a clearer picture of our results of operations generated by our core operating activities, thus enabling our management to evaluate relevant trends more meaningfully when considered in conjunction with (but not in lieu of) other measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS. The metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles. Our non-IFRS operating metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you 80 ----- should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS operating metrics only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” We have defined each of the measures and shown their calculation in “Summary Consolidated Historical _Financial and Other Data.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.7,Description of Key Items in Our Income Statement,17.7.1,Revenue Recognition,"Revenues include alarm monitoring and installation fees. The revenues are recognized only where there is persuasive evidence of a sales agreement, the delivery of goods or services has occurred, the sale price is fixed or determinable and the collectability of revenue is reasonably assured. Revenues are recognized less discounts and value added tax and after eliminating sales within the Group. 81 ----- For customer agreements containing multiple deliverables (installation and monitoring services) the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. More specifically, income is recognized as follows: - **_Alarm monitoring. Income from alarm monitoring services is recognized during the period to which the service relates. - **_Installation fees. As part of alarm installation, customers pay an installation fee and, in certain cases, a payment for products sold. This fee is recognized as income on the installation date. In circumstances where part of an installation fee is deferred, we recognize as income the present value of the deferred payments, adjusted for cost of capital and the risk of default. Revenue also consists of other revenue, which is derived primarily from new products and services sold to customers in our existing installations. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales includes cost of materials (excluding material costs that are capitalized), salaries, commissions, depreciation, amortization, bad debt expense, cost due to retirement of alarms and other costs directly attributable to installation of new alarms or alarm monitoring. We currently capitalize the costs of the alarm equipment purchased by us from our suppliers and installed in connection with newly acquired customers to the extent we retain ownership of the equipment, and these costs are not reflected as cost of sales. In addition to material costs, we also capitalize direct costs related to the acquisition of customer contracts as intangible assets as they fulfil the requirement in IAS 38, intangible assets, of internally generated intangible assets. Our salespeople sometimes both sell systems to new customers and install such systems once the sales are made. As a result, in these instances, the costs of both selling and installing the systems are included in costs of sales because they cannot be accurately separated. Thus, “cost of sales” includes some costs that are actually selling expenses but cannot be separately allocated to a specific selling and administrative function. _Selling and Administrative Expenses_ Selling and administrative expenses includes salaries, commissions, depreciation and amortization, cost due to retirement of property, plant and equipment as used in selling and administrative functions, rents and other indirect costs for sales supervision, sales branches, customer support supervision, information technology services and other overhead costs such as finance and human resources and management and SDIs. _Finance Income_ Finance income primarily includes income earned from our currency and interest rate derivatives and interest income. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs relates mainly to exchange rate differences, interest expenses, net effects from currency derivatives, changes in fair value of interest rate swaps, FX swaps and other finance costs. External and intra-group loan balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity are revalued at the end of each reporting period and adjusted for currency fluctuations. _Income Tax Expense_ Income taxes include current and deferred tax. These taxes have been calculated at a nominal amount according to each country’s tax provisions and the tax rates that have been defined or announced and are highly likely to become effective. Current tax is tax that is paid or received for the current year and includes any adjustments to current tax for prior years. In the case of items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income, any tax effect on equity or other comprehensive income is also recognized. Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, by which deferred income tax is calculated on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the amounts can be utilized. 82 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions, was 13.0%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the increasing customer base. Our customer base grew 12.0% from 3,236,226 on September 30, 2019 to 3,623,024 on September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of our continued customer acquisition efforts and low attrition.

Interest expense increased by €14.6 million mainly due to higher indebtedness. The increase of €99.5 million in our other financial items cost was due primarily to a negative impact from non-cash FX valuation of certain of our debt items. _Income Tax Expense/Benefit_ Income tax expense decreased by 26.0%, or €10.1 million, to €28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from €39.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions, was 18.6%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in our customer base and increases in our average revenue per user. Our customer base grew from 2,930,753 as of December 31, 2018 to 3,346,712 as of December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of our continued customer acquisition efforts and low attrition.

In the past we have hedged our foreign exchange exposure when we have deemed it appropriate. Our current risk in transactions primarily relates to material purchases in US dollars procured by our logistics centers. In our operating countries we have limited foreign exchange transaction risk as we incur costs and derive subscription fees in the local currency of our countries of operation.

When testing for impairment of goodwill and other assets, the carrying amount should be compared with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less its costs to sell and its value-in-use. Impairment testing is an area involving management judgment, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flow derived from such assets using cash flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. Since there are normally no quoted prices available to estimate the fair value less costs to sell an asset, the asset’s value-in-use is usually the value against which the carrying amount is compared for impairment testing purposes and is measured on the basis of assumptions and estimates. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flow, certain assumptions are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including management’s expectations of: - long-term sales growth rates; - growth in adjusted EBITDA; - timing and quantum of future capital expenditures; - change in working capital; and - the selection of discount rates to reflect the risks involved. We prepare and approve formal long-term financial plans for our operations, which are used in value in use calculations. For the purposes of the calculation, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: - an assumed 3% growth rate for mature regions; and - a projected long-term compound annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA in accordance with the long-term financial plan with extended periods for developing countries.

The calculation of the our total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain tax positions the resolution of which is uncertain until an agreement has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process. The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profits, losses and/or cash flows. The complexity of our structure following geographic expansion makes the degree of estimation and judgment more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the company and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result, there may be substantial differences between the tax charge in the consolidated income statement and tax payments. The Group has also exercised significant accounting judgment regarding net operating loss utilization. Moreover, we have exercised significant accounting judgments regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets. The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future against which the reversal of deductible temporary differences can be realized. Where the temporary differences related to losses, the availability of the losses to offset against forecast taxable profits is also considered. Recognition therefore involves judgment regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax assets have been recognized. 92 ----- The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements in respect of each matter are derived from the company’s best estimation and judgment as described above.

We offer premium monitored alarm services to our portfolio of over 3.6 million customers (as of September 30, 2020) and design, sell and install alarms with network connectivity across 16 countries in Europe and Latin America. Our management estimates, based on third party data, that as of September 30, 2020, we were the leading provider in all ten of our top ten geographies. Our management also estimates that, on a weighted-average basis and based on our number of customers at the end of 2019, we benefit from a relative size advantage of 2.0 times across the totality of our geographies, 2.8 times across our top ten geographies and 3.0 times in our top five geographies. Since our company was founded in 1988, we have continually expanded our customer base, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17% from 2000 to December 2019. As of September 30, 2020, residential households comprised 80% of our customers, while small businesses accounted for the remaining 20%. Based on historical trends, we currently estimate that our residential customers remain with us, on average, for 15 years and our small business customers remain with us, on average, for more than 7 years. As a result, we believe that our Portfolio Services revenues (representing 82.2% of our total revenue for the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, and 81.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019) provide us with a high-margin, stable source of recurring cash flow. For the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, we generated revenue of €2,091.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €833.7 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenue of €1,900.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €702.9 million. We operate a subscription-based service business, which we conduct through two primary operating segments: - **Portfolio Services. Our Portfolio Services segment provides monitoring services to our over 3.6 million customers as of September 30, 2020 for a monthly subscription fee. We typically enter into self-renewing monitoring agreements with our customers at the time of installation, and the majority of our customers pay via direct debit. We then monitor our installed base of alarms through 20 dedicated monitoring centers located throughout Europe and Latin America to verify triggered alarms and initiate an appropriate response. We also provide customer service, maintenance and technical support for all our installed systems. We have a strong track record in customer retention, with an attrition rate of 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. This strong retention rate contributes to the stable and recurring cash flow that the segment generates, allowing us to fund investments that grow our customer base. For the last two quarters ended September 30, 2020, annualized, our Portfolio Services segment generated revenue of €1,719.4 million (representing 82.2% of our total revenue) and Adjusted EBITDA of €1,255.0 million (representing a 73.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin). - **Customer Acquisition. Our Customer Acquisition segment develops, sources, purchases, provides and installs alarm systems for new customers in return for an upfront sales and installation fee. This installation fee typically only covers a portion of the costs associated with marketing, selling, purchasing equipment and installing each alarm system. As a result, the segment represents an upfront investment (which we partly expense and partly capitalize) in our business to acquire new customers. These new customers then become part of our Portfolio Services segment, driving revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and profitability growth. Due to the discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition activities, we are able to increase our marketing, sales and installation investment activities to grow our customer base, or, alternatively, reduce our investment in such activities to manage our cash on hand, over the short to medium term. Additionally, we classify certain non-core business under our Adjacencies segment, which mainly represents the sale of remote monitoring and assistance devices and services for senior citizens in our Spanish market and, starting in 2020, the sale of connected cameras under the Arlo brand in Europe. We offer a range of alarm systems with a variety of features, ranging from simple break-in detectors to more complex alarms with premium features, such as sophisticated cameras, home environment monitoring capabilities, smoke detectors, and two-way audio communication solutions. These alarm systems are directly connected to our monitoring centers, as well as to our customers through our web-based “MyPages” application and our mobile Verisure App, available on Apple iOS, Android and Microsoft-based smartphones. These applications allow our customers to set, monitor and control various alarm functions and settings. We primarily market under the Verisure and Securitas Direct brands, under which we have developed and launched an innovative line of products, which represent our newest technology and most advanced features (including our Verisure App).

Within our first ten years of operations, we had expanded our platform internationally, entering the home security market segments of Norway, Denmark, Finland, Spain and France, with subsequent expansion into Portugal in 2001 and Belgium and the Netherlands in 2002. In September 2006, we separated from Securitas AB and were listed on the OMX Stockholm Nordic Exchange, before being taken private in an acquisition by EQT Holdings AB in 2008. In 2009, we entered Latin America by establishing operations in Chile, followed by entry into Brazil in 2011. We were acquired by Bain Capital and H&F in 2011. Between 2012 and 2015 we opened operations in Peru, Italy and the United Kingdom. We began operations in Germany in November 2018 and in Argentina in July 2019. In late 2015, H&F acquired Bain Capital’s stake as part of the 2015 Acquisition, placing it in a majority shareholder position alongside Company management. In July 2017, H&F sold approximately 9.4% of its stake in the Group to Eiffel and in January 2019, H&F further sold approximately 12.5% of its stake in the Group to Eiffel. In April 2019, H&F sold approximately 7.5% of its stake in the Group to Alba. Throughout our recent history a portion of our equity has consistently been held by our broad management team, whose interests are thus closely linked to the interests of our investors.

Residential monitored alarm penetration rates remain relatively low in the market segments in which we operate. For example, Western Europe and the United States have roughly the same addressable market segment; however, penetration rates in Western Europe are approximately 4 times lower than in the United States. According to third-party data and our estimates, the average penetration of residential dwellings and business premises with monitored alarms in 2019 is estimated to be approximately 4% in Western Europe, compared to approximately 19% in the more-developed U.S. market. Furthermore, there is significant potential for further penetration of monitored alarms in our existing markets. For example, based on third-party data and our estimates, in all of our existing geographies the addressable market segment was approximately 127 million locations compared to approximately 83 million locations in the United States, with a penetration rate of less than 10% (or approximately 12 million locations) compared to approximately 41% (or approximately 34 million locations) in the United States. In 2019, the total number of locations (business and residential households) in our existing geographies was approximately 352 million, comprising approximately 35 million businesses and approximately 317 million residential households, compared to approximately 177 million in the United States, made up of approximately 32 million businesses and approximately 144 million residential households. Penetration rates across the total number of locations in our existing geographies in 2019 was less than 4% compared to approximately 19% in the United States. We are present in all large Western European countries including Germany where we began operations in November 2018. Within Europe, 5 of the 12 countries in which we currently have operations have average penetration rates below the Western European average. Source: Company estimates and third-party data. We believe that there is not a permanent structural gap between Western Europe and the United States in terms of the residential monitored security market segment and that Western Europe offers significant headroom to grow. Additionally, we believe we are uniquely positioned to reach the untapped potential customer-base in the Western European market. We believe that the primary driver of the different penetration rates between the United States and Europe is historically lower marketing spending and commercial presence in Europe and, as 97 ----- a result, lower consumer awareness of the benefits of security systems. As we have focused on increasing product awareness, through our GTM model, our European operations have shown strong growth. From December 2009 to September 30, 2020, we grew our subscriber base in Europe from approximately 1.2 million to over 3.6 million. Source: Company estimates and third-party data. Therefore, we believe the European market segment for monitored security is structurally attractive and we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of future business growth opportunities. Our larger scale, sophisticated GTM model and ability to access innovations will continue to enable us to reap the benefits of the structurally attractive European market segment. _Significant market know-how in an industry with scope for differentiation_ We believe that there is significant scope for differentiation in the alarm monitoring business. - First, market participants need to gain awareness and brand trust among customers in order to be given permission to monitor customers’ families and assets. This not only requires an established presence in the market but also a balance between lead generation and maintaining a high-density sales force. The GTM model requires interplay of customized products, brand, recruitment, training, lead generation and allocation, which we believe is highly complex to build and operate. We also seek to tailor our approach to the countries where we operate in order to deliver differentiated service to our customers that indicates comprehensive understanding of cultural norms and communities. - Second, we believe that scale, including on a regional basis, is a differentiating factor in the alarm monitoring market segment. Scale provides avenues for increased investment in innovative product and service features, greater customization of products to fit GTM efforts, enhanced monitoring and response service and the ability to drive operating leverage on fixed and semi-fixed cost structure. - Third, the demands of customer safety and well-being drives significantly higher service level requirements than in many other subscription-based businesses, which we are able to address through deep customer know-how, our 20 monitoring center locations and our sizeable sales force. 98 ----- We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these market dynamics owing to our established and leading competitive position, our strength of brand and reputation, our scale and density of operations, our differentiated GTM model with experienced face-to-face salespeople, our technology and our diversified customer base.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Our focus on regions throughout Europe, including the Nordics and Southern Europe, as well as certain geographies in Latin America, helps mitigate the risks of localized economic downturns. We focus on residential homes and small businesses, offering differentiated security services and products, which has resulted in a high recurring revenue. We additionally benefit from relationships with police and fire departments, which allow us to provide exceptional service to our customers, bolstering our levels of customer trust and loyalty. Our residential customers tend to be middle-to-higher-income households with assets to protect and lower price sensitivity. The resilience of the demand for our security systems is underpinned by the strength and reputation of our brand and the nature of the services we offer, as we address the safety of our customers’ families and property, and we believe customers view our solutions as less discretionary than other expenditures. As such, we believe that customers are less prone to cancel our services during economic downturns. Consequently, we currently estimate that our residential customers, which represented 80% of our total customers as of September 30, 2020, have an expected subscription life of, on average, 15 years. We are a vertically-integrated company that benefits from a differentiated product and service offering. We capitalize upon our expertise in both traditional and digital media marketing, which we believe provide us with strong lead-generation when engaging potential new customers. Furthermore, we can invest significant resources in product development to drive the introduction of new technologies and features into our alarm systems which helps upselling, enhances subscribers’ engagement and experience and, as a result, reduces attrition. As a result of our efforts, we have been successful in introducing new products and technologies to enhance our value proposition to our customers such as our Seniors and Guardian offerings (in Spain), anti-jamming (in Spain, Portugal and France) and compact and affordable vision-impairment smoke-releasing devices (in Spain since June 2017, the United Kingdom and France since 2018, and Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Chile, Norway and Belgium during 2019 and 2020). As a result of our high level of engagement with customers and our industry-leading product and service offering, we reap the benefits of high customer advocacy and the high-quality referrals generated by our existing subscriber base, which enables us to consistently grow our business. Our growth strategy is supported by our execution at a local level of a tried and tested set of competencies, as well as by leveraging our industry know-how at an international level by operating in a range of geographies at different stages of their expansion lifecycle. We also supplement our growth strategy through strategic alliances and accretive tuck-in acquisitions, which allow us to grow our business through multiple pathways. _Industry leading customer retention_ In addition to our diversified, high quality customer base, we have the lowest rate of customer attrition amongst our industry peers (as shown in the chart below based on a representative sample of other consumer subscription businesses), with an attrition rate of 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, which we define as the number of terminated subscriptions to our monitoring service in the year, divided by the average number of subscribers over the year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

We believe our leading position in the geographies where we operate in the monitored alarm segment is due to our differentiated business model. We offer premium monitored alarm services that include high quality products tailored to the residential and small business market segments. In 2019, within our market segments, we were the largest player in nine out of ten of our largest operating countries by subscribers count, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Italy and Brazil, in which we held a RGS (compared to our nearest competitors) of 5.8 times, 2.2 times, 1.4 times, 1.7 times, 1.4 times, 4.2 times, 1.8 times, 2.9 times and 1.9 times, respectively. We also estimate that during 2020 we became the largest player in France, with a RGS of 1.0 times. Most of our traditional competitors have small local or national portfolios, the largest of which have between 250,000 and 550,000 customers. We also believe our position is further strengthened by high brand awareness in our largest geographies, and plan to use our leading position and expertise to drive future growth into new geographies. We dedicate significant resources to marketing, advertising and selling activities to further grow brand awareness and our subscriber base. For example, management estimates that our sales force in Spain of approximately 3,600 full-time employees, as of September 2020, is approximately three times larger than that of our closest competitor in monitored alarm services. Our sales force, in addition to having the advantage of being larger in size than those of our competitors, also benefits from what we believe to be industry-leading training and a sales method that we continually refine and improve in order to best serve our customers. We believe that the depth and scale of our activities provide us with a significant advantage in competing for talented employees, by allowing us to offer a leading, growing and international career platform. We are the driving force behind the growth of the residential monitored alarm segment in the regions in which we operate. In 2019, we estimate that we represented approximately 60% of the net subscriber growth in such regions. We have been able to grow our subscriber base every year since 2000, from approximately 170,000 to over 3.3 million as of December 31, 2019, which is a CAGR of approximately 17%. We believe that our scale, along with the differentiation provided by our brand trust and awareness, sales force coverage and direct go-to-market (“GTM”) model (wherein our large network of field sales representatives meet potential customers 96 ----- face-to-face), our focus on innovation and our ability to attract talented employees, have resulted in a track record of above-market growth in certain of our geographies. For example, in Spain from 2008 to 2019, we grew the number of our customers at a CAGR of 7.4% compared to an estimated 2% for all other market participants (based on third-party data), while in France during that same period we grew our customer base at a CAGR of 20% compared to 4% for all other market participants (based on third party data). Further, our ability to grow our subscriber base has resulted in an increase in our share of supply relative to our competitors across the residential monitored alarm segment as a whole. We estimate that our market segment share, in our 2019 geographies, grew from 17% in 2009 to 28% in 2019, representing a CAGR of our share of approximately 5%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

We believe our products benefit from industry-leading innovations that provide our customers with premium security solutions for the entire spectrum of residential monitoring needs. We believe these innovations also help us secure higher price points from our customers given they support our premium service (we call this our “more-for-more” strategy) as well as promote greater customer loyalty. We are also the only European residential alarm provider to have developed an anti-jamming capability, as well as an affordable, compact, wireless and battery-operated vision-impairment smoke-releasing device (promoted under the name “ZeroVision” with the slogan “they can’t steal what they can’t see”, and launched between the 100 ----- second half of 2017 and the first half of 2020 in all of our countries except Peru, Brazil and Argentina), in all cases driving upselling and enhancing subscribers’ engagement and experience. In 2019, we also formed a strategic partnership with Arlo, the world’s leading innovator in the connected camera category, and acquired its European business for $54 million (approximately €48 million at then-current exchange rates). This allows us to offer connected camera services alongside our professional security proposition. We believe that Arlo’s European retail and e-commerce presence is highly complementary with our existing go-to-market structures, creating as a result what we view as the first European multi-channel go-to-market strategy for consumer security and surveillance products and services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Our management team, supported by our strong regional teams, has a successful operating history, with one co-founder still serving in a leadership role. Under their leadership we have delivered growth in customers, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our management team is a blend of new talent from the consumer and telecom industries as well as those who have significant history with the business. Our Group Chief Executive Officer, Austin Lally, now in his seventh year with the Company, has led the development of our strategic roadmap with our management team, co-founder and Sponsor, leveraging his prior experience of over 25 years in building and growing leading consumer businesses in Europe, the United States and Asia. Our co-founder Luis Gil remains involved in critical roles that support our plans for further growth, including geographic expansion. Our senior managers are deeply aligned with their co-shareholders as large shareholders themselves, and have extended this “owner-operator” culture by driving clear accountability down to every branch level in the organization. Our strong culture and strategic alignment across geographies, including sharing of best practices, is another source of competitive differentiation. _High level of employee engagement_ We have a high level of employee engagement, evidenced by our engagement and employee net promoter score (“eNPS”) model launched in 2016, which saw the participation of approximately 92% of our employees in 2019. In the last three years, our level of company engagement has remained very high, at around 82 points out of a possible 100, based on the arithmetic average of 9 questions designed by Willis Towers Watson to assess whether employees are engaged, enabled and energized.

Among other things, we believe the “sunk cost” of the installation fee is a factor behind our customer loyalty. This helps screen for more committed customers and, we believe, increases the likelihood of customers continuing to use our system over the long term. We believe that our installation fee and subscription service creates “skin in the game” and an incentive to remain a long-term customer, which in turn helps us avoid low-quality customers, since, historically, low upfront fees can be associated with higher levels of attrition. We believe that our high upfront fees well-reflect our quality proposition and give us a long-term competitive edge over competitors, who install systems for free or with a low upfront fee. Our prices are typically at a premium to our competitors’ prices. We believe our customers’ willingness to pay such premium prices is due to our high level of customer trust, leading brand name, innovative solutions, and exceptional levels of product and service content.

The profitability of our Portfolio Services segment results from its relatively low operating cost and capital expenditure requirements (in the Portfolio Services segment, capital expenditures amounted to 2.3% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020). While our subscriber growth is dependent on our Customer Acquisition segment, we have discretion when to invest in acquiring new customers to either replace cancelling customers or grow our existing subscriber base. Furthermore, a significant portion of our Customer Acquisition spend is variable in nature, including marketing investment and variable sales commissions. Our historically low attrition rate has meant that we do not need to divert significant resources towards customer replacement costs. As such, we have flexibility in how we invest the substantial cash flow generated by the Portfolio Services segment. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we invested 33% of our Adjusted EBITDA from the Portfolio Services segment to acquire new customers and used the remaining 67% of Adjusted EBITDA from the segment primarily to replace cancelled customers, service our debt, for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. If, on the other hand, we invest our additional cash flow to acquire new customers, it allows us to potentially grow our Adjusted EBITDA in the long term. As a result of the discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition spend, we are able to efficiently manage our growth, reducing our costs and capital expenditure requirements and allowing us to use additional cash flow for debt service requirements or other purposes. For example, as lockdowns were instituted in many of the countries in which we operate as a result of COVID-19, which made customer acquisition challenging, we took decisive steps to reduce our costs, including reducing marketing spending and temporarily suspending a portion of our field sales force. During the month of June, as governments began or continued to relax lockdown restrictions, we increased our commercial activity and progressively brought back our field sales force. In the three months ended September 30, 2020, cash flow from operating activities increased to €311 million due to an increase in profitability from the three months ended June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

For Argentina, considered a hyperinflation economy, a monthly average FX has been used (EUR/ARS 80.20 for September 2020). In late 2014, we began a group-wide operational improvement plan, FOG, with the aim of optimizing our cost structure and improving productivity, which is still ongoing and has now become embedded in our culture. The program seeks to leverage our scale and share best practices across our global footprint in order to reduce costs and improve our margins. We have, since the program’s implementation, monitored the obtained savings through the implementation of a diligent bottom-up process with quarterly reporting to country and Group management teams. The actual savings in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 exceeded €35 million, obtained through development and sharing of best practices in our alarm monitoring, customer care and maintenance departments as well as our Group-wide procurement departments’ ability to leverage our size and negotiation power to obtain reduced prices across our main cost buckets. We expect that our incremental cost savings for the period from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 will be at least €35 million. In recent months, we have introduced a new detailed bottom-up cost savings plan comprised of approximately 80 global initiatives and over 600 initiatives at the local level, which we believe will enable us to achieve targeted gross aggregate cost savings of over €200 million between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2025. _Resilient performance during economic downturns_ We have a consistent track record of profitable organic growth despite ongoing economic uncertainty in certain of our geographies. Both in Spain and Portugal, where the effects of the previous economic downturn were among the most severe in Europe, we continued to expand our operations. For example, between December 2008 and December 2010 we were able to grow our customers in Spain and Portugal by 8.4% and 48.9%, respectively despite GDP contracting by 3.6% and 1.4%, respectively. In Spain, from December 2010 to December 2013, during a period of continued economic uncertainty, we were able to grow our customers by 6.5%, while GDP fell 5.5%. Likewise, in Portugal during the same period, we were able to grow our customers by 37.6%, while GDP fell by 6.6%. Source: Company information and third-party data (1) Cumulative growth at constant prices Between 2007 and 2019, our subscribers in Spain and Portugal grew at a CAGR of 7.7% and 13.3%, respectively. Along with increasing the number of total customers during a period of economic uncertainty, we were also able to grow our Portfolio Services EBITDA. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-march 2020, our business has demonstrated the ability to quickly and successfully adapt to the new environment. We have continued to grow our customer base, reaching over 3.6 million customers as of September 30, 2020 (corresponding to an annual growth rate of 12% compared to September 30, 2019). Our track record of organic growth has been consistent to date. During the first nine months of the year, we increased our subscribers by over 276,000 (83,000, 38,000 and 155,000 during the first, second and third quarters of the year, respectively) while also maintaining our attrition rates largely in line with previous periods at approximately 6.5% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 despite the uncertain macroeconomic situation. 103 ----- _Flexible cost base can be adjusted amid an economic downturn_ Our cost base is highly variable, and in the event of an economic downturn, can be downsized. For example, in response to the economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced customer acquisition spending through a reduction in marketing expenditures and realigned remuneration and commission structures. We also temporarily suspended the employment activities of many of our field sales organization and other commercial teams. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our cost base, including both operating expenses and capital expenditures, was €1,739 million (excluding SDIs), of which approximately 62% consisted of costs from our Customer Acquisition segment (both operating expenses and capital expenditures), approximately 27% consisted of operating expenses from our Portfolio Services segment, approximately 6% consisted of general corporate capital expenditures, approximately 3% consisted of capital expenditures from our Portfolio Services segment and approximately 1% consisted of costs from our Adjacencies segment. Of the costs from our Customer Acquisition segment, approximately 39% related to cost of sales and installation, approximately 26% related to branch and central support costs, approximately 22% related to the cost of material (with limited minimum volume commitments) and approximately 13% related to marketing costs (which are fully variable and discretionary). Approximately 75% of our cost of sales and installation and branch and central support costs were salary related costs, and cost of sales and installation salary costs are largely variable and based on commissions. Operating costs from our Portfolio Services segment are also largely variable, with most of the cost varying with portfolio size, and the corporate and Portfolio Services capital expenditures are largely discretionary.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Each of our monitoring centers has a designated back-up facility where we can transfer most of our monitoring and customer service capabilities in a short period of time. In some of our larger countries this backup facility is in the same country. In other countries we use a monitoring center in one of our other countries to serve as the backup facility. In each case, the backup facility will be able to operate as a fully functional monitoring center if we need to transfer operations. This backup capability is intended to ensure that our customers will not experience a significant service gap if one of our centers has a malfunction or disruption. Furthermore, we are able to provide remote alarm monitoring services in the event our employees are not able to reach the monitoring center, which has enabled us to provide consistent service and response levels. Our alarm monitoring centers receive tens of thousands of alarm triggers every day. Our monitoring staff analyses each triggered alarm through a process of verification and prioritization whereby they identify false alarms and reduce the number of times false alarm messages are forwarded to emergency responders (such as police and fire departments). We use a variety of techniques to verify alarms. In many geographies, we primarily use call-backs, whereby our operator calls the customer to determine the reason for the alarm, often using code words. There is usually a separate code for deactivating a false alarm and another code for a duress situation. If the duress password is given, our staff will alert the police. A majority of our alarm systems also use camera detectors that record a sequence of images when an alarm is triggered and subsequently transmit these images to the monitoring center for operator verification. A third verification technique used in most geographies is a guard service that will physically respond and investigate upon alarm notification. We outsource this function to third-party security guard services on a contractual basis. Our verification processes are designed to rapidly identify the source of and respond to each alarm, which is key to maintaining customer satisfaction and filtering false alarms. 105 ----- _Customer Service and Support_ Top-quality customer service is the main focus of our business. Customer loyalty (and sustaining low attrition rates) is directly linked to the quality of the service we deliver. Maintaining high-quality standards is therefore a key element to retaining customers and thereby maintain our recurring revenue and profitability. We aim to minimize attrition by using a “first time fix” strategy, whereby we make every effort to address a problem when it first arises. This approach reinforces our customers’ perception of our responsiveness, reliability and high-quality service. We regularly evaluate our customer service performance through a variety of key performance indicators, including response time, first time resolution, net promoter score and attrition rate. We believe our customer service and support function is a key reason we have been able to maintain low attrition rates among our customer base. We also proactively support our customers through a number of quality assurance programs focused on retaining customers. For example, in most regions we offer our customers a structured training program for the first six months after installation of our monitored alarm systems to familiarize them with their systems, recognizing that the more comfortable customers are at using our products, the more likely they are to maintain their subscriptions. We tailor these programs to the dynamics and culture of each region where we operate. _Alarm Response Coordination_ To the extent a triggered alarm is verified, we work with local police forces, guarding companies and fire services to coordinate a response. In this context our industry-leading ability to filter false alarms, and only call first responders when there is a high likelihood of a real problematic situation, is key. In Spain, for example, law enforcement trusts us enough to have established a direct connection between our monitoring station and their dispatch system.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Within this segment, our marketing activities and partnerships generate high-quality leads, which are converted to sales by our sales force and franchise partners. The origination of each new customer requires a net investment from us, as the costs associated with acquiring a new customer exceed the upfront installation fee we charge. In addition to the costs of the alarm equipment installed, we also have costs associated with sales commissions, sales activities, training of our sales staff, marketing and installation overhead. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, our average cash acquisition cost (including related capital expenditure) per new customer net of installation fees (CPA), was €1,242, representing a 3.5 year payback period. Our Customer Acquisition segment comprises three primary operating activities: product development, manufacturing and supply and sales and installation. _Product Development_ We use our in-house development team or contract with third parties to design our products. We operate two development centers located in Malmö, Sweden and Madrid, Spain. We actively drive development of next-generation products and applications to meet the changing needs of our customers. We also seek to develop products and applications that allow us to up-sell our existing customers and to attract new customers. We strive to develop products that can be brought to market quickly, with a focus on obtaining approvals from local governments and adhering to local regulatory requirements. We have many innovative technologies, including battery operated motion detectors with built-in cameras and interconnected smoke detectors. We also have proprietary technology solutions, especially in our wireless communication and integrated solutions capabilities that govern the communication between the alarm system and the operator. We are entering a phase of progressive deployment of our next generation of products and services, starting with a vision-impairment smoke-releasing device recently launched in Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and France, which makes it highly difficult for a burglar to see beyond his or her hands. We expect further product launches over the next two to three years, and we expect those products to widen the gap between our offering and that of our competitors. In 2019, we also formed a strategic partnership with Arlo, one of the world’s leading innovators in the connected camera category. We are now able to offer connected camera services alongside our professionally monitored security proposition, both leveraging Arlo’s industry-leading catalogue products and custom cameras specifically designed for our business. 106 ----- _Manufacturing and Supply_ We outsource the manufacture of our products to our network of electronic equipment manufacturers. Outsourcing the manufacturing of our alarm systems reduces our fixed costs and enhances our flexibility. We source our alarm systems primarily through a limited number of suppliers but have contingency plans in place in case of a disruption in supply. For example, in some cases we have equivalent products that we are able to offer to our customers, and in others we have alternative suppliers for the affected products. We typically have exclusivity agreements with our suppliers with regard to our proprietary technologies. If a supplier fails to meet agreed upon delivery dates, we may (depending on the severity and frequency of the failure) have a contractual right to terminate our agreement with that supplier and, provided that we have the necessary intellectual property rights, switch to a new supplier. We generally also have minimum purchase commitments with our suppliers. _Sales and Installation Customer Qualification. Customer qualification is an essential component of our customer acquisition strategy,_ as we seek to attract customers who are more likely to value quality and retain our services over the long term. Consequently, we target households and businesses we believe will be long-term customers, such as residential customers living in wealthier areas and in owned single-family dwellings and, to a lesser extent, owned apartments. We also selectively target small business customers. Our customer qualification process often involves credit checks, where allowed under local laws. Additionally, in the majority of cases, we typically charge a substantial upfront fee for installing an alarm system. We believe this upfront fee essentially acts as a qualifier, ensuring that we attract customers that are financially able and motivated to retain our services for the long term. This function is particularly important in the context of certain types of small businesses that tend to experience higher turnover rates. We believe that the way we shape the customers’ expectations and understanding of our solutions through the initial sales and installation process, as well as our customer onboarding process, supports our low attrition levels. _Sales Approach and Marketing Strategy. Our sales efforts are conducted through our large network of field_ salespeople (including both franchise partners and direct employees) and telesales channels, which seek to engage customers directly at their home. To maximize the potential for customer acquisition, each sales person goes through our rigorous training program, learning both the benefits of our products and the most effective way to communicate these to potential customers. We also provide our salespeople with sales coaches to help them reach sales targets. We source our leads directly from our sales force and by way of a centralized lead-generation process through which we coordinate our various marketing efforts to generate prospects to further support our sales force, particularly our more junior salespeople. Our salespeople are evaluated by strict performance standards and are remunerated with a largely variable compensation package that is linked to attracting quality customers. This enables us to identify and appropriately compensate talented individuals, such that our most talented employees have an incentive to continue working with us on a long-term basis. Our core GTM approach centers on leads-based, face-to-face sales. Additionally, where possible we are employing a “sales-installer” approach, whereby the person responsible for selling an alarm system also has the responsibility for its installation. We gain several operational benefits from the sales-installer model, including reduced costs by combining the roles of salesperson and installer and speed of installation. Moreover, our sales-installers have a more comprehensive knowledge of the benefits and technical details of our offerings and their know-how and ability to deliver an effective security system lends credibility to themselves as sales-installers and to our product offerings. From the sales-installer’s perspective, combining the sales and installer roles generates more income for the sales-installer and increases the sense of accountability among our sales force, further fostering a customer service oriented culture and enhancing the sales and service experience for our customers. In the partner model, we cooperate with local entrepreneurs who sell, install and manage the ongoing customer service within their designated geographic area. The appropriate sales and service model for each country has been selected on the basis of local characteristics. Partners are typically local entrepreneurs who work exclusively with us and have the right to use our SECURITAS DIRECT and VERISURE trademarks. Although these partners become our agents, they remain legally independent from us and we retain full ownership of the contracts negotiated between the partner and the customer on our behalf. Selection of partners involves a strict evaluation process that focuses on key attributes such as entrepreneurial and sales skills and knowledge of the regional area. Once selected, partners undergo rigorous training to ensure that they meet the same high standards we expect of our own employees. We design our compensation plans for our partners to align their goals with our targeted key performance indicators, which helps us generate quality accounts and encourages high quality customer service and long-term partnerships. 107 ----- Partners represent a material proportion of our sales in Sweden and in Norway, while a non-material share of sales in Finland and Denmark are generated using this model. We design our marketing strategy to support our field sales and to grow our brand awareness. These efforts often include local TV advertisements, online marketing and cooperation with local companies (for example, utility and insurance companies). Online marketing is an increasingly important component of our marketing strategy, as our websites provide information about our products and services and enable potential customers to book a sales and qualification visit by one of our sales- installers. Further, we work with various alliance partners, including insurance companies and banks, in most of our countries to generate leads and increase awareness of professionally monitored alarm services among families and small business owners.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

We believe that offering a full and integrated suite of services and products provides us with a competitive advantage in our geographies, especially compared to certain players in the connected home market or the telecommunications market, or competitors in certain countries who offer only a limited range of services. We have two primary segments: our Portfolio Services segment, through which we manage our existing customer base; and our Customer Acquisition segment, through which we seek to gain new customers to replace cancelling customers and selectively grow our customer base. Additionally, we classify certain non-core business under our Adjacencies segment. This segment mainly captures the sale of remote monitoring and assistance devices and services for senior citizens and, starting in 2020, selling connected cameras under the Arlo brand in Europe.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Our product strategy combines what we believe to be superior services with advanced technology. Accordingly, we have five key goals: - deterrence that relies on exterior signs (explicit rather than generic signs, including, for example, warnings about our anti-jamming capabilities and smoke-releasing devices) and alarm sirens; - detection using magnetic and motion detectors with cameras; - identification and verification using high-quality image, two-way voice and voice recording; - personal protection; and - rapid response to alarm triggers (within approximately 60 seconds from the time the alarm is triggered), including the ability to quickly expel an intruder through release of thick vision-impairment smoke. A typical new alarm installation would consist of the following: - a central unit with wireless communication, control of other alarm components (the gateway), and, often, embedded anti-jamming technology; - a control panel for switching the alarm system on and off with a security code or smart key; - an alarm siren; - a number of cameras and motion detectors; - door and window magnetic contacts; and - a vision-impairment smoke-releasing device controlled remotely from our monitoring station. Additional residential offerings include a wireless smoke detector that communicates with other smoke detectors in the home for quicker warning in the case of a fire. The control panel for our products uses two-way radio. As an alternative to a security code, the alarm can be activated or deactivated using a smart key. These devices are securely linked to our central monitoring station and can also be accessed from the internet via our web-based MyPages application as well as from customers’ smartphones using our Verisure App. With these applications, customers can, for example, activate and deactivate their alarm systems, receive the status of the alarm, remotely unlock doors and control other home automation functions through their personal devices, including smartphones. By bundling services and establishing partnerships with companies in complementary segments, we have begun extending some our core services in the context of the “connected home,” with examples including our offering of Arlo’s digitally connected cameras and alliance with ASSA ABLOY to offer digital locks. Our platform also provides the flexibility to seamlessly add new applications to our security system. Our add on features include additional keypads, additional door and window magnetic contacts, automatic switches to open doors and windows, flood detectors, humidity detectors, additional encrypted keys and SOS buttons. In some countries, customers are able to order certain add-on features from our websites. Some add on features may be self-installed by the customer, while other features require a sales installer to install such products. 108 ----- The majority of our small business installations use the same wireless platform that we use in our residential alarms, but we can offer added functionality, such as video capture. _Funding Our Growth—Cost Savings Initiative_ - In late 2014, we began our first group-wide operational improvement plan, FOG, with the aim of optimizing our cost structure and improving productivity. This board and management approved our cost savings program to leverage our scale and share proven best practices across our global footprint, thereby reducing costs and improving our margins. The program is implemented around three categories of initiatives since late 2014: Portfolio Operations, Direct Spend and Indirect Spend. In late 2019, the program was extended to also incorporate Commercial and Technology initiatives, and in recent months we have launched a new operating cost review process to identify additional cost saving opportunities and covering the entire cost base of the Company. The program is closely monitored and savings are reported quarterly at the board and management level, with 2017, 2018, 2019 and overall program to date results exceeding expected level. Our incremental cost savings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 exceeded €35 million, and we expect incremental cost savings for the period from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 will be at least €35 million. - **_Portfolio Operations are aimed at lowering maintenance costs by focusing on automation, improving product quality, introducing refurbished products and reducing the number of maintenance visits; focusing on improving call-center operations and expanding customer self-service; and lowering the total number of call-outs (i.e., dispatching guards to customers). - **_Direct Spend is aimed at lowering our direct spend by renegotiating prices for our core products with our main suppliers, implementing technological insights gained from our analysis of our competitors’ products, and optimizing our manufacturing supply chain. - **_Indirect Spend is aimed at reducing our indirect spend, primarily through the implementation of professional procurement practices across our global footprint (including the establishment of a group-wide procurement function), leveraging our purchasing scale in negotiations with vendors and lowering costs associated with our car fleet, telecom services and office IT costs. - **_Commercial Costs is aimed at optimizing our cost of acquisition by focusing on refining our sales-installer model and their compensation scheme; optimizing our marketing spend by controlling effectiveness and efficiency of the campaigns and call centers; having a lean sales support leveraging digital tools and business intelligence; having a frugal approach to non-core costs (salesmen benefits, branch expenses, travel, etc.); and monthly control and accountability of spend at every cost center. - **_Technology Spend is aimed at optimizing our investment in R&D and IT by improving productivity though transforming our ways of working (e.g., Agile/Scrum methodologies, continuous delivery); investing in new more efficient technologies (e.g., test automation, continuous delivery, API-based and microservices architecture); enhancing our infrastructure efficiency; evolving our demand management processes; and reviewing our new product development model strategy and approach. Successful realization of our anticipated cost savings is subject to a number of assumptions.

When we began our business in 1988, the SECURITAS DIRECT name leveraged the reputation that the broader SECURITAS brand name had in the security business market segment, and we expanded this reputation to the residential and small business alarm market segment. We believe our logotype and trademark are now widely recognized in the residential and small business marketplace and make up important elements of our marketing and sales strategy. The Group’s use of the SECURITAS DIRECT and DANSIKRING DIRECT (in Denmark) brand names is subject to non-exclusive license agreements for the use of the trademarks SECURITAS and DANSIKRING (only in combination with DIRECT) from the Group’s former parent company, Securitas AB (publ). In accordance with these agreements, we can sublicense our rights to our subsidiaries that are wholly owned and controlled by us as well as to our partners who are responsible for installation and maintenance of our alarm systems. The Group currently has a good working relationship with Securitas AB (publ) and the current license agreement is not due to expire until December 2029 (subject to certain termination provisions). In 2009, we developed the proprietary VERISURE brand to complement Securitas Direct as part of our long term branding strategy. The VERISURE brand is proprietary to the Group and the Group owns approximately 120 registered trademarks across 20 jurisdictions, many of which relate to the VERISURE brand. The Group continues to invest in developing the VERISURE brand in all jurisdictions in which it operates, and plans to progressively transition all its operations to the VERISURE brand in the future.

These regulations are not currently present in our largest geographies, such as Spain, Sweden, France, Portugal and Norway. However, Denmark does prohibit door-to-door sales. In this jurisdiction, we have had to alter our sales approach to rely more on advertising our products in public forums. A similar restriction is in place in Belgium. Nevertheless, a European Directive approved in December 2019 establishes that door-to-door sales cannot be banned “as is” but that limitations to this activity can be adopted by Member States, which have two years to transpose the Directive into law. If we continue to encounter these regulations, it may require us to change our sales approach with potential customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and _Industry—Our business operates in a regulated industry, and noncompliance with regulations could expose us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and negative consequences.” All of the countries in which we operate_ have regulations protecting consumers in their dealings with a company’s sales force.

An increasing number of local governmental authorities have adopted laws, regulations or policies aimed at reducing the perceived costs to them of responding to false alarm signals. For example, in France, police will only respond to an alarm they have been forwarded once that alarm has been verified. Spain, our largest country by revenue, has recently regulated verification protocols requiring that alarms have to be verified either through video, audio or personal verification steps in order to be considered “confirmed alarms.” Otherwise, emergency personnel will not respond unless three sequential alarms are triggered within 30 minutes or are verified by means of audio or video. If emergency personnel are dispatched to a false alarm, some jurisdictions allow for penalties to be 110 ----- imposed on either the alarm owner or the alarm provider. In France, police are allowed to penalize the alarm provider for a false alarm that has been forwarded. Likewise, in Spain, emergency responders have discretion to impose penalties for frequent false alarms as high as €30,000 per incident. These changes may cause alarm service providers to adopt additional measures to limit the risk of false alarms, such as the use third-party guard services to verify alarms, install new monitoring equipment or upgrade existing equipment.

In order to conduct installations of alarms, we generally must be registered for this purpose in the countries we operate in. We currently have all required registrations in each of our countries. Some markets impose regulations on the maintenance of our products. France and Spain require that we provide certified maintenance service as part of each contract we enter into with a customer.

On or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Senior Noteholders in respect of the Senior Notes Liabilities in accordance with the Senior Notes Finance Documents. _Payment Blockage Provisions_ Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of the Senior Agent, (to the extent otherwise prohibited under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” below, the Senior Notes Issuer shall not make (and shall procure that its subsidiaries shall not), and neither the Senior Notes Trustee nor the holder of Senior Notes (the “Senior Noteholder”) may receive from the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, any Permitted Senior Note Payment (other than certain amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee for its own account, although this excludes any amounts for services provided by the Senior Notes Trustee or any adviser, receiver, delegate, attorney, agent or appointee thereof, in each case in respect of restructuring advice that exceeds a de minimis threshold) if: - a Senior Secured Payment Default is continuing; or - an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) (other than a Senior Secured Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as the case may be) delivers a payment stop notice specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Secured Event of Default to the Senior Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Notes Trustee until the earliest of: - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that payment stop notice; - in relation to payments of Senior Notes Liabilities, if a Senior Notes standstill period is in effect at any time after delivery of that payment stop notice, the date on which that standstill period expires; - the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default has been remedied or waived in accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities or the Senior Secured Finance Documents (as applicable); - the date on which the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as applicable) delivers a notice to the Senior Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice; - the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and 136 ----- - the date on which the Security Agent or the Senior Notes Trustee takes Enforcement Action (as defined below) permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor. Unless the Senior Notes Trustee waives this requirement (i) a new payment stop notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior payment stop notice and (ii) no payment stop notice may be delivered in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of Default more than 60 days after the date the Senior Agent and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as applicable) received notice of that Senior Secured Event of Default. The Senior Agent and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) may only serve one payment stop notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) to issue a payment stop notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No payment stop notice may be served by the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) in respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) at the time at which an earlier payment stop notice was issued. Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Notes Indenture as a result of the issue of a payment stop notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Notes Indenture or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice with respect to the relevant Event of Default on behalf of the Senior Noteholders. No payment stop notice will prevent the Senior Notes Issuer from making a payment from its own assets if that payment is of the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Notes and such payment is not financed by a payment to the Senior Notes Issuer from a member of the Group that was prohibited by the Senior Credit Facilities, or the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents or prohibited under “—Payment Blockage _Provisions” above. Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_ No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Notes Finance Document (including the Senior Notes Indenture) by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior _Notes” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those_ provisions. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Notes Finance Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice. _Cure of Payment Stop_ If: (i) at any time following the issue of a payment stop notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default, that payment stop notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and (ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Noteholders an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Senior Notes Indenture and which would have been Permitted Senior Note Payments but for that payment stop notice or Senior Secured Payment Default, then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Notes enforcement notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Noteholders. _Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Noteholders may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Notes Finance Documents (other than the Intercreditor Agreement or any security document) in accordance with their terms at any time, provided that the terms of the Senior Notes Finance Documents may not be amended or waived if such amendment or waiver would breach the terms of the Senior Secured Finance Documents. 137 ----- _Restrictions on Senior Notes Enforcement_ Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group: (i) neither the Senior Notes Trustee nor any Senior Noteholders shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any transaction security;

or - the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization of any member of the Group which owes any liabilities of the Group owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, or has given any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities, or any of such member of the Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such member of the Group, or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction, except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action: - the taking of any action falling within the seventh paragraph of the first bullet point above or the bullet point immediately above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary) to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the registration of such claims before any court or governmental authority and the bringing, supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent any loss of the right to bring, support or join proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; - any discussions or consultations between, or proposals made by, any of the Primary Creditors with respect to instructions to enforce the transaction security; - to the extent entitled by law, the taking of action against any creditor (or any agent, trustee or receiver acting on behalf of such creditor) to challenge the basis on which any sale or disposal is to take place pursuant to powers granted to such persons under any security documentation;

Each Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes will, at the time a Guarantor grants such Guarantee: - be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee (including, in the case of (i) the Senior Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Notes, and (ii) in the case of all Guarantors, the senior guarantee given in favor of the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations, if any); - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including the guarantee of the Senior Notes by that Guarantor (other than the Senior Notes Issuer)); - be secured as set forth below under “—Security”; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade creditors) of that Guarantor that is secured with property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor’s Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. 155 ----- The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the _Collateral.” The Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will_ apply to, and restrict the granting of, guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. All of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Not all Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not, and will not, guarantee the Senior Secured Notes generated 5% of our EBITDA. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of September 30, 2020, after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had €6,937.5 million of Indebtedness (as well as €700.0 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and related ancillary facilities after taking into account outstanding letters of credit), and its non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would have had no material Indebtedness. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Security Agent will act with respect to Collateral only at the direction of a simple majority of the senior secured creditors (including, for this purpose, both drawn and undrawn uncanceled commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities, Hedging Obligations and Indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes). The Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the Collateral. As a result, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, so long as any amounts under any other senior secured debt (including, for this purpose, both drawn and undrawn uncanceled commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities, Hedging Obligations and Indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes) remain outstanding, other than in limited circumstances.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Senior Secured Notes as described under this heading “Change of Control” upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as defined above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a 170 ----- definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. The occurrence of a Change of Control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also require the Issuer to make an offer to holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes to repurchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to holders thereof to repurchase any Senior Notes, in each case at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including financial resources of its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—We _may not be able to finance a change of control offer and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a change of control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any clause of this covenant is or may be based on Consolidated EBITDA, the amount that may be Incurred under such clause shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated 175 ----- EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue). If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “— _Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._ Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial Calculations” below, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) for the purpose of Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Issuer may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a different currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness; (b) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (c) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, subject to the election in clause (a) above; and (d) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial _Calculations” below, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if_ Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior-priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Interest on the SEK Senior Notes will: - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2021; and - be payable to the holder of record of such SEK Senior Notes on the Clearing System Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date, or to the extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, to the holders of record of the SEK Senior Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date. If a particular interest payment date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next Business Day. Therefore, the relevant interest period will be one or more days longer. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Determination Date, determine the SEK Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following SEK Interest Period (the “SEK Interest Amount”). The SEK Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the SEK Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each SEK Senior Note outstanding at the commencement of the SEK Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the SEK Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The determination of the SEK Applicable Rate and the SEK Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the SEK Senior Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; _provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the SEK Senior Notes is permitted under any applicable law. “Determination Date” means, with respect to an SEK Interest Period, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such SEK Interest Period. 239 ----- “Reuters Page Side” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “SEK Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first SEK Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude May 15, 2021. “SEK Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) SEK 10,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “STIBOR” with respect to an SEK Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in SEK for a three month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page Side as of 11:00 a.m. Stockholm time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page Side does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal Stockholm office of each of four major banks in the Stockholm inter bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Stockholm time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Stockholm inter-bank market for deposits in a SEK Representative Amount in SEK for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the SEK Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in Stockholm, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Stockholm time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a SEK Representative Amount in SEK to leading European banks for a three month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the SEK Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the SEK Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding SEK Interest Period. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this definition, STIBOR with respect to any SEK Interest Period shall not be less than 0% per annum. “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans European Automated Real Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Euro Senior Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and each new SEK Senior Note will be in a principal amount that is at least SEK 1,250,000 and integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Senior Notes as described under this heading “Change of Control” upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as defined above under the caption “—Optional _Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding_ anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. The occurrence of a Change of Control under the Senior Notes Indenture would also require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to holders thereof to repurchase any Senior Secured Notes, in each case at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, 254 ----- even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including financial resources of its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a change of control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any clause of this covenant is or may be based on Consolidated EBITDA, the amount that may be Incurred under such clause shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue). If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “— _Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._ Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial Calculations” below, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) for the purpose of Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Issuer may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a different currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness; (b) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (c) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, subject to the election in clause (a) above; and (d) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency 259 ----- Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial _Calculations” below, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if_ Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. 321 ----- We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledges such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations issued thereunder by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare 323 ----- contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (i.e. the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuers or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. 325 ----- source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations 328 ----- where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”. Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the secondary insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex for _concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: (a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; (b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; (d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking 329 ----- must be made in writing and is subject to approval by known local creditors. The rules on qualified majority and voting that apply to the adoption of restructuring plans under the laws of the Member State shall also apply to the approval of the undertaking. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: (a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii)insolvency practitioners and courts; (b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group, (c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and, (d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralised system for the interconnection of the insolvency registers referred to under (b). The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (“exit day”) and has now entered its transition period. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it has effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) shall form a part of domestic law on and after exit day until the end of the transition period. In addition, whilst direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be made to the Recast Regulation.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs 330 ----- in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of (i) the amount of the claims in each class and, (ii) where the Member State so requires, the number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by 17 July 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on 17 July 2024 or, in others, on 17 July 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

When declared bankrupt, a receiver in bankruptcy (konkursförvaltare) who is appointed by the competent court will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distributing the proceeds amongst the creditors. The purpose of Swedish bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up a Swedish company in such a way that the company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is considered best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in accordance with mandatory priority rules (see below under the heading “—Priority of certain creditors”). In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and its directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets. The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in bankruptcy may, under certain circumstances, in its discretion, choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts.

Upon obtaining an enforcement order or judgment against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. If (i) agreed between a pledgor and a secured creditor or a party acting as agent on behalf of a secured creditor and (ii) the secured creditor or its agent is in physical possession of the security assets, the secured creditor or the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without having obtained an enforcement order or court judgment. However, where a security holder seeks to enforce such security itself, certain statutory notice requirements apply and the pledgee is under a fiduciary duty to protect the interest of the pledgor when exercising its rights as a secured party or liquidating a secured asset. This duty includes, inter alia, an obligation to notify the pledgor of any liquidation or sale of the collateral, to account for the proceeds of such liquidation or sale, and to pay to the pledgor that portion of the proceeds of such liquidation or sale which exceeds the debt secured by such asset. There are provisions in the Swedish Contracts Act (avtalslagen (1915:218)) which prohibit an enforcing party from foreclosing a secured asset by assuming ownership of the secured asset without accounting for the value thereof. Certain categories of properties may however only be enforced through the Swedish Enforcement Authority. Additionally, in respect of a pledge over shares, the secured creditor or its agent may subject to the conditions above, carry out the enforcement and sell the shares through private or public sale or auction. Such process is however subject to certain fiduciary duties and must be carried out in a manner that safeguards the interests of the pledgor. For example the process should include a reasonable notice period before enforcement. There is no set time for such notice period; instead it will depend on the circumstances at hand. Generally, the notice period should be sufficient to allow the pledgor to participate in the sales process or prevent the enforcement by settling the secured obligations and sufficient for potential buyers to be able to make an informed decision in the sales process so that they may place the best possible bid for the shares. However, when determining what is a reasonable notice period, the interests of the secured creditors must also be taken into consideration, where one aspect may be that a delay in enforcement might lead to deterioration of the value of the security. In certain circumstances the fiduciary duty will also mean that the notice period needs to be shortened in the interest of the pledgor to prevent such deterioration. An enforcement in bankruptcy of security over, inter alia, shares, can in principle be carried out in the same manner as outside bankruptcy (subject to certain statutory notice requirements and mandatory fiduciary duties). A creditor having security over a specific object may demand that such object is sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue delay, provided the underlying claim is not disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does not, however, apply to property that is necessary for the continuation of the debtor company’s business. The receiver in bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the receiver in bankruptcy determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the implementation of a composition would become substantially more difficult, provided that a postponement is not unreasonable to the secured creditor. Upon enforcement of security over shares, such shares may, subject to the conditions and certain fiduciary duties as set out above, be sold by the secured creditor or its agent in an auction process. Such process will be subject to certain statutory notice requirements which depend on whether or not the shares are deemed to be financial instruments. In respect of shares which are not financial instruments, the shares may not, unless the receiver in bankruptcy consents otherwise, be sold earlier than four weeks from the day of the court session where the directors testified on the veracity of the accounts (edgångssammanträde) and the receiver in bankruptcy shall be given no less than three weeks prior notice of the auction and be offered to acquire the shares at least one week prior to any enforcement action is taken. In respect of shares which are financial instruments, the secured creditor may sell the shares without such notice periods, provided that the auction is carried out in a commercially prudent manner and that in respect of shares in an unlisted subsidiary of the bankruptcy debtor, after notifying the receiver in bankruptcy and giving the bankruptcy estate the opportunity to acquire the shares.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, some preferential and secured creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: “Specific preferential rights” and “General preferential rights.” “Specific preferential rights” apply to certain specific property and give a creditor a right to payment from such property. “General preferential rights” cover all property belonging to the 332 ----- insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Such preferential and secured creditors may also under certain circumstances enforce the security in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (utsökningsbalken _(1981:774)), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets (handpanträtt), enforcement_ through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act.

Corporate reorganisation proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year. An administrator (rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors of the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that the consent of the administrator is required for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the granting of a reorganisation order, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the granting of a reorganisation order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business. The corporate reorganisation proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts entered into by the debtor. Further, the opening of corporate reorganisation proceedings entails, under certain circumstances, limitations in the contracting party’s right to terminate a contract due to the debtor’s delay with payment of performance. During the reorganisation procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue as normal. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor may not pay a debt that fell due prior to the granting of the reorganisation order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganisation proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor (which is the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company and with a Swedish law pledge over a loan evidenced by a negotiable promissory note (löpande skuldebrev) provided that the share certificates of such company or such negotiable promissory note (as the case may be) has been physically delivered to the secured creditor or its agent and kept by the secured creditor or its agent).

Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set-off rights or priority rights.

This could be the case if, at the time the guarantee or security interest for the obligations of a third party is provided by a Swedish Company, such third party is deemed unable to fulfil its obligation to indemnify the Swedish Company if the guarantee is utilized or if the security is enforced. Further, this could also be the case if a Swedish Company provides any security interest or guarantee in respect of debt owed by a non-wholly-owned subsidiary of the Swedish Company without the Swedish Company receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return.

The Swedish Companies Act also prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a guarantee or a security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company or the shares in any of its parent companies incorporated in Sweden. Moreover, it is generally believed that the prohibition also applies when a Swedish Company provides a guarantee or a security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of a subsidiary of any of its parent companies incorporated in Sweden not being a subsidiary of the relevant Swedish Company.

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an acceleration event would therefore not be effective until an acceleration event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected. Such unperfected security interests are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider.

In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 health crisis, the Spanish Government has approved various extraordinary resolutions. These extraordinary resolutions include, among others, Royal Decree-Law 16/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 16/2020, de 28 de abril, de medidas procesales y administrativas para hacer frente al COVID_19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia) (“Royal Decree-Law 16/2020”), Royal Decree Law 34/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020, de 17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial y al _sector energético, y en materia tributaria) or Act 3/2020 (Ley 3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia) (“Act_ 3/2020”) which have introduced several temporary and extraordinary measures that impact pre-insolvency and insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings, which are called “concursos de acreedores,” are applicable to all persons or entities (except for public entities). As a general rule, these proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors (“CVA”) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets. Insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current insolvency (insolvencia actual) or imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is deemed insolvent when it becomes unable to meet regularly its obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency) or when it foresees the inability to regularly and timely pay liabilities as they become due and payable (imminent insolvency). _Voluntary insolvency_ Insolvency is considered “voluntary” (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. A debtor (and in the case of a company, its directors) is required to apply for insolvency proceedings within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of current insolvency. A debtor is entitled to apply when it expects that it will be unable to meet its current obligations in the near future. Insolvency proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that the debtor may request in order to avoid the attachment of its assets by its creditors. The general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if the debtor who is in actual or imminent insolvency and has not been declared in insolvency notifies the court that it has started negotiations with its creditors to seek support for either an out-of-court refinancing agreement (acuerdo de refinanciación) or an early composition agreement (propuesta anticipada de convenio) set out in articles 596.1º and 333 et seq., respectively, of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 bis communication by reference to the previous regulation, currently regulated in article 583 of the Spanish Insolvency Law). After filing, the debtor is not entitled to file another communication for a term of one year. The debtor has a three-month additional grace period to reach an agreement with its creditors and one month more to file for insolvency if the above mentioned period of three months has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such three-month period following the filing of the pre-insolvency communication, creditors’ petitions for 335 ----- insolvency will not be accepted (a petition for insolvency potentially filed by a creditor within the next month will not be processed by the court unless the borrower does not file for insolvency by the end of such month) and court or out-of-court enforcement actions, other than those arising from public law claims, over those assets or rights deemed necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business activities, are prohibited or suspended, as applicable. In addition, enforcement proceedings over any other type of assets that have been brought by creditors holding financial liabilities shall be prohibited or suspended (as applicable) provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating. Nevertheless, secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the corresponding secured assets although once proceedings have been initiated they shall be immediately suspended. The prevention or suspension of enforcement procedures does not apply to public credit rights (créditos de derecho público). Additionally, article 6.1 and 6.2 of Act 3/2020 establishes a suspension of the legal duty to file for insolvency until 14 March 2021, irrespective of the debtor having filed an article 583 communication or not. Moreover, the courts will not accept mandatory insolvency filings (including those filed since the state of emergency was declared on 14 March 2020) until such date. In addition, voluntary insolvency filings within such period will have preference, even if they are filed after the mandatory insolvency filings. Likewise, article 6.3 of Act 3/2020 grants the debtor with a six-month term (instead of the four-month regular term) to petition for insolvency if the debtor files the so-called 5 bis communication on or before December 31, 2020. _Mandatory insolvency_ If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed “voluntary” (concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a third party, the insolvency is deemed “mandatory” (concurso necesario). Under Article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if it can prove that it has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amounts owed. Creditors petitioning a mandatory case must prove one of the following circumsntances to show the debtor’s current insolvency (creditors do not have standing to file upon imminent insolvency): (i) there is a prior judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency of the debtor, which is final (i.e., that cannot be appealed), (ii) there is a title by which an order for execution or enforcement has been issued without the seizure having resulted in sufficient eligible assets known for full payment, (iii) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets, (iv) there is a generalised default on payments by the debtor (v) there is a generalised default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three months), or (vi) there is a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets. _Certain effects of the insolvency on the debtor_ In the case of voluntary insolvency (which should be filed by the debtor within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of current insolvency), as a general rule, subject to certain exceptions, the debtor retains the management and full powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention (intervención) of the insolvency administrators (administradores concursales). In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, subject to certain exceptions, the debtor’s management powers are suspended, and management’s former power, including the power to dispose of assets, is conferred solely upon the insolvency administrators (sustitución). The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the court will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and in turn whether the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a timely basis or is incomplete, and the workload of the court. _Ranking of credits_ A judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within one month of the publication of the insolvency proceedings’ commencement in Spanish Public Gazette (“BOE”) (although there are some exceptions). Creditors must provide original documentation or electronic form thereof to justify their claims. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a report which includes a list of the debtor’s assets, and a list of acknowledged claims that are classified according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims benefiting from special privileges, (ii) claims benefiting from general privileges, (iii) ordinary claims and (iv) subordinated claims. - Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially, in rem security). These privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from the date of declaration of the insolvency, 336 ----- unless the relevant charged asset is not necessary for the debtor’s professional or business activity. The amount of debt benefiting from special privileges is limited to the collateral assets as valued according to certain criteria described in the Spanish Insolvency Law (i.e., the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset minus those claims that hold higher ranking security over such asset)). The remainder will have the ranking that would have corresponded to it if it had not been secured by an in rem security. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are secured. However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities and pay these claims (as a debt against the insolvency state—créditos contra la masa) under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to the composition agreement unless they give their express support by voting in favour of the composition agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favour of such composition agreement. - Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others, specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities. Debts with public entities or authorities corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations are recognized as privileged for half (50%) of their amount, debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, for up to half (50%) of the amount of such debt. Also, new funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 606 et _seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate_ will also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the composition agreement if they do not agree to the said composition agreement, unless creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class (there are four classes: public, labor, finance and others) vote in favour of such composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first collecting payment, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish Insolvency Law. - Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid after claims benefiting from general privileges have been completely paid and on a pro rata basis vis-à-vis each other and together with the amount not covered by the proceeds obtained from the foreclosure of assets guaranteeing the privileged credits. If the debtor achieves a composition agreement, the ordinary credits will be affected. - Subordinated creditors (those subordinated to all ordinary creditors by virtue of an agreement or pursuant to law), include, among others, credits communicated late (outside the specific one- month period mentioned above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines; creditors which are “specially related parties” (personas especialmente relacionadas) to the insolvent debtor; claims resulting from acts that were set aside where the creditor was declared in the judgment to have acted in bad faith (rescisión concursal); and certain credits deriving from contracts with reciprocal obligations if the creditor attempts to prevent the fulfilment of the contract to the detriment of the insolvency interests. Subordinated creditors are second level creditors; they do not have the right to vote at the creditors’ meeting (whereby the CVA is approved or rejected) and have very limited chances of collection, according to the ranking established by Spanish Insolvency Law. - Exceptionally, Article 7 of Act 3/2020 establishes that credits deriving from “cash receipts from loans, credits or other analogous transactions” granted to the debtor “as from the declaration of the state of emergency” by “specially related parties”, will rank as ordinary claims if insolvency proceedings are opened during the two years following the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain (i.e., before 14 March 2022). Likewise, ordinary and privileged credits of third parties upon which specially related persons related subrogate as a consequence of payment of those debts in the name and representation of the debtor as from the declaration of the state of emergency will also rank as ordinary claims in any insolvency proceedings opened during the indicated period. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability, (ii) any direct or indirect shareholders holding more than 5% (for companies which have issued securities listed on an official secondary market) or 10% (for companies which have not issued securities listed on an official secondary market) of the debtor’s share capital by the time the credit right under dispute in the 337 ----- insolvency scenario arises, (iii) directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company, as well as such individuals holding such positions within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency, and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set out in (ii) above. In addition, it is established in the Spanish Insolvency Law the refutable presumption that the assignees of the above are also “specially related persons” if the assignment has occurred within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency. Nevertheless, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalised their credit rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 606 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law shall not be deemed as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Notwithstanding the above, claims against the debtor’s estate (for example, certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration opening the insolvency proceedings) will be generally payable when due according to their own terms. Debts against the insolvency estate, include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after insolvency proceedings are declared and deriving from obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency, (iv) those that derive from the exercise of claw back actions within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from non-contractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency, (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a CVA in accordance with Article 672 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, excluding claims granted by the debtor or by “specially related parties” to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose (Article 4.3 of Act 3/2020 has provided for an exception of this limitation in case of default of CVAs approved or modified until 14 March 2022, as long as the new CVA, or the amended one, identifies the borrower and the maximum amount of the financing to be granted or the guarantee to be perfected), and (viii) in case of subsequent insolvency, 50% of the funds lent in compliance with a refinancing arrangement in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 606 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law (except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose). As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings. When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtors and creditors, the law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is, then, legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or inferring measures affecting the debtor’s asset (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). Additionally, as a general rule, subject to specific exceptions established by Spanish case law, the right to setoff is prohibited unless (i) the legal requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency, even if such compensation is alleged afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the claim to the insolvency administrator; (ii) the claims and debts arise from the same legal relation; or (iii) the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a foreign law that permits set-off in cases of insolvency. _Moratorium_ The current Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights (in _rem security) over assets or rights that are considered to be necessary for the continuance of the debtor’s_ business in the event of insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the date of the declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency if the insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation; (ii) the date the creditors reach an agreement that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest; or (iii) the court conducting the insolvency proceedings declares that the asset is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s activities in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Law. Commencement of the liquidation phase causes the loss of the right to commence a separate enforcement process in relation to those secured lenders who did not commence enforcement either before the declaration of insolvency or after a year since the declaration of insolvency. _Early termination provisions_ Pursuant to the Spanish Insolvency Law, early termination provisions due to the insolvency of one of the parties to a contract are unenforceable, unless the debtor or the insolvency administrator, with the approval of the court, considers that termination is in interest of the insolvency estate. In addition, the declaration of insolvency 338 ----- determines that interest accrual is suspended, except credit rights secured with an in rem right, in which case non-moratorium interest accrues up to the value of the security. _Hardening periods_ There is no automatic claw back by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings but instead the insolvency administrator must expressly challenge those transactions. In addition, creditors who have applied to exercise any claw back action (stating the specific action they aim to contest or revoke and their grounds), shall be entitled to exercise such action if the insolvency administrator does not do so within the two months following their request. Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, upon declaration of insolvency, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate (i.e., causing a so-called “patrimonial damage”) carried out during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded, regardless of fraudulent intention. However, in accordance with Article 238 of the Spanish Insolvency Law actions that took place earlier than two years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the general regime of avoidance set forth in the Spanish Civil Code. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.” Damage does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest or on the equality of treatment among creditors. The Spanish Insolvency Law contains the non-rebuttable presumption: that those acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts which result in the early repayment or settlements of obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an _in rem security) are detrimental. In addition, unless the debtor or another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a disposal made in favour of a related person or entity (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) as well as the creation of a security interest securing a pre-existing obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency and which are secured by means of an in rem security, are presumed to be detrimental. In the case of actions not covered by the presumptions above, the burden of proof is on the person bringing the action of rescission. The business, acts and payments made in the ordinary course of business and under market conditions, and the security created in connection therewith, may not be rescinded. Accordingly, any act of disposal with a “related person or entity,” as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law, is presumed to be detrimental unless proved otherwise. Also, the general principle of “No termination effect”, although there are some statutory exceptions, is established such that all agreements remain effective at the time of the insolvency. Any contractual provision in such kind of contract granting a creditor the right to terminate an agreement based only on the declaration of insolvency of the debtor (except if expressly permitted by specific laws, e.g., Law 12/1992, of May 27, on agency agreement (Ley 12/1992, de 27 mayo, sobre contrato de _agencia), or if the unilateral termination of the contract is allowed by law) will be deemed as non-existent (void)_ and will, therefore, be unenforceable. Payments made to the debtor in insolvency will release the payor as long as he or her was not aware of the debtor’s declaration of insolvency when making the payment (knowledge is presumed in the event the declaration of insolvency has been published in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado). Besides, certain refinancing agreements (acuerdos de refinanciación) meeting certain legal requirement set forth in Article 597 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law are also protected against the claw back risk. Only the insolvency administrator is entitled to challenge said refinancing agreements and clawback actions can only be based on a breach of the requirements set out below. There are two types of protected refinancing agreements: (i) collective refinancing agreements and (ii) individual refinancing agreements. Collective refinancing agreements are defined as those agreements which the debtor enters into with creditors whose credits represents at least three-fifths ([3]/5) of the debtor’s liabilities on the date of the agreements (evidenced by an auditor’s certificate), which must (i) be based on a viability plan that allows the on-going operation of the company in the short and medium term; (ii) significantly extend the credit available or modify the debtor’s obligations (for example, by extending the term or including new obligations to substitute former ones), and (iii) be executed in a public instrument. Individual refinancing agreements include refinancing agreements that, despite not supported by the majority of creditors needed for collective agreements, may still be protected if they comply with certain strict 339 ----- requirements (among others, that they improve the ratio of assets over liabilities and that the resulting amount of current assets is equal to or greater than current liabilities). Additionally, court-sanctioned refinancing agreements or “Spanish scheme of arrangement” (acuerdos de _refinanciación homologados) will be protected against clawback actions (said protection derives from the court_ approval obtained when those are signed by creditors representing at least 51% of the financial debt). _Liquidation_ Liquidation operates where a resolution between the debtor and its creditors is not reached or when it is decided upon by the insolvency court. The debtor can file a petition for liquidation at any time; although it must file such petition if, during the period while the arrangement is in force, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of such arrangement (except for the exceptional regulation set forth in Article 4 of the Act 3/2020, as provided below). In such a case, the company will be aimed at dissolution. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits. The insolvency administrator will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the insolvency court. The insolvency administrator is required to report quarterly on the liquidation process and has one year to complete the liquidation. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint (if so required) a different insolvency administrator. Default of a CVA leads to liquidation of the debtor, so that no legal possibility to amend the CVA is allowed. Exceptionally, Articles 3 and 4 of Act 3/2020 have included some temporary exceptions to the creditors’ right and debtor’s duty to file for liquidation, as well as the possibility for the debtor to pursue an amendment to a CVA previously approved, subject to certain limitations and requirements. Secured lenders commencing an enforcement process after a year as of the declaration of insolvency will not lose their right to enforce separately in liquidation. _Additional amendments to the Spanish insolvency regulation_ Additional amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law are expected in future, in order to comply with the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency). The implementation of the Directive should be concluded by 17 July 2021 (although Member States are allowed to delay such implementation for a term of one year in the event they encounter particular difficulties in implementing the Directive).",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent’s actions in an enforcement situation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain was to be carried out by the Security Agent, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in their favor by each of the note holders, duly notarized and legalized. Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly 340 ----- contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself.

This restriction applies to granting credit and providing guarantees and security interest. The term “credit” covers loans to shareholders but could also cover sales from the company to shareholders on credit and prepayments of purchases by the company from its shareholders. The term “security” covers both asset security as well as personal security (for example, guarantees or co-debtor arrangements). Whether a credit or security is in compliance with the Acts has to be determined at the time the credit or security is granted. If, for example, the conditions later change so that the company no longer has any distributable funds, this does not affect the status of the credit or security already granted. The above restriction does not, however, apply to credit, guarantees or security interests for the obligations of a parent company or another company within the same “group,” as defined in the Acts. This exemption must be read in conjunction with the group definition in Section 1-3 of the Acts which, broadly speaking, includes Norwegian (private or public) limited companies which are controlled (directly or indirectly) by the parent company of the group. A Norwegian limited liability company may also grant credit or provide guarantees and security interest for the obligations of a foreign parent or sister company, provided that such credit, guarantee or security interest serves the “financial interest of the group,” as defined in the Acts. The Norwegian preparatory works to this exception of the Acts sets out that guarantees and/or security interest granted in favour of other group companies (Norwegian or foreign) should as a general rule be considered to serve the financial interest of the group, however, guarantees and/or security interest granted to enable funds being distributed to the ultimate owners of the group will most likely not fall within this exception. Accordingly, any guarantees and/or security interests by Norwegian guarantors in favour of other obligors for funds made available under the Notes for the purpose of distributing dividends to the ultimate owners/sponsors of the group will be void and infringing the above limitation. In addition to the restrictions with regard to, amongst others, upstream and cross-stream guarantees and security as outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Acts, restricts the ability of a Norwegian limited liability company from providing financial assistance (including to put funds at disposal, grant loans or provide security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or in connection with the acquisition of shares in its parent company (including any intermediate parent company) (hereinafter referred to as “Acquisition Debt”). The restrictions against financial assistance referred to above apply irrespective of whether the company in which shares are acquired is a Norwegian or foreign company. In order for a guarantee, loan or security provided by a Norwegian guarantor in favour of a purchaser of shares in the Norwegian guarantor or its parent company to be valid and binding, the general rule being that financial exposure of the Norwegian guarantor must not exceed the amounts that the Norwegian guarantor has available for distribution of dividends to its shareholders, and adequate security must be deposited for the repayment or recovery claim. There is furthermore amongst others a requirement that the credit worthiness of the purchaser is evaluated by the board of directors, that the assistance is approved by the board of directors and that the assistance is approved by the general meeting of the Norwegian guarantor according to a special procedure. From 1 January 2020 this strict legislation was amended and certain exemptions introduced which, subject to various conditions, permits a Norwegian guarantor to provide financial assistance for Acquisition Debt in circumstances where the acquirer is domiciled in an EEA state and the acquirer is member to the same group of companies as the Norwegian Guarantor or the acquisition results in the establishment of a group of companies. The restrictions apply not only to the granting of loans, guarantees and security, but also to making assets available and other transfers which are not lawful distributions in accordance with the Acts. 341 ----- The assistance is prohibited if made “in connection with” the acquisition of shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing of an acquisition loan facility or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity). There must, however, be sufficient connection both in time and as regards other circumstances surrounding such financial assistance for it to contravene Section 8-10. Accordingly, any guarantees and/or security interests by Norwegian guarantors in favour of other obligors for funds made available under the Notes for the purpose refinancing loans used to finance the acquisition of the shares in Securitas Direct (including any intermediate parent company) or finance the acquisition of the shares in such Norwegian guarantor may be void under Norwegian law as infringing the above limitations. A loan, guarantee or security interest infringing the limitations set out in Section 8-7 and/or Section 8-10 of the Acts is void and any funds paid out pursuant to such guarantee or security interest will have to be repaid. In addition, loans, securities and guarantees of guarantors incorporated in Norway may be deemed void for failing to comply with the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Acts regulating transactions between the relevant company and its shareholders and transactions within the “group.” The principle of corporate benefit also exists in Norway and may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian guarantor’s ability to offer credits or a guarantee and provide security interest to shareholders (or close associates of the shareholders), in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance and upstream/cross stream guarantees, loans and security interest described above. As a consequence of the restrictions on financial assistance in Norway, the value of a guarantee and any security provided by a Norwegian guarantor may be limited. In addition, a guarantee or security interest infringing the limitations set forth in Sections 8-7 and/or 8-10 of the Acts will be void, and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. Finally, an illegal arrangement of this kind may give rise to directors’ liability issues. To cater for the above mentioned restrictions, the Guarantees and the security interests provided by the Norwegian companies are subject to limitation language substantially in the form as follows: The obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway (“Norwegian Guarantor”) for the Issuers’ obligations under the Guarantees shall be limited by such mandatory provisions of law applicable to that Norwegian Guarantor limiting the legal capacity or ability of the relevant Norwegian Guarantor to grant and/or honor a guarantee thereunder (including, but not limited to, the provisions of Sections 8-7 to 8-10 (both inclusive) of the Norwegian Private Limited Liability Companies Act of 13 June 1997 No. 44 1997 or the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act of 13 June 1997 No. 45 1997 (as the case may be) (the “Norwegian Companies Act”)), and the obligations and liability of each such Norwegian Guarantor under the Guarantees or under any other guarantee or indemnity contained therein shall only apply to the extent not so limited. The limitations set forth in these sections will apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Norwegian Guarantor and to any guarantee, undertaking, indemnity, any similar obligation resulting in a payment obligation and any payment, including but not limited to distributions, cash sweeps, credits, loans and set-off, pursuant to or permitted by any such security and made by any Norwegian Guarantor. The liability of each Norwegian Guarantor for the Issuers’ and the other Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes will be limited to €3,600,000,000 of the principal value of the debt being guaranteed, with the exact amount to be reflected in the underlying documents, plus any unpaid amount of interest, fees, liability, costs and expenses under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The key features of Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of debtor’s assets, (ii) assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) testing and revocation of transactions (including securing of existing claims) made prior to the bankruptcy, (iv) handling of the debtor’s contractual relationships and (v) distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors. 342 ----- Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors (holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy. There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) be in “deficit” (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenues) (the “balance sheet test”). During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor’s assets are controlled by the court appointed liquidator (generally a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor’s assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then to distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors. All of the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests/rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not limited to the realization of assets. Secured creditors are in principle not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may realize the security, and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (automatic stay) (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate may, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, also decide to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal rights in the assets. Any under-secured amount (i.e., any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed as an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim. In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority: - secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset—either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate); - super priority claims (claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s costs, obligations of the estate); - salary claims (within certain limitations); - tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations); - ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and - subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three-month period (and in respect of transactions in favor of related parties up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for old debt and transaction at under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one creditor at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years. It should also be noted that the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the respective asset’s estimated value or sales value over assets mortgaged/pledged by the debtor or mortgaged/pledged by a third party for the debtor’s indebtedness (limited, however, to the standard Norwegian Court Fee (presently being in the amount of 1 172 Norwegian kroner) multiplied by 700 for assets registered in an asset register (No. _realregister)). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security pursuant to the Norwegian Financial_ Security Act no. 17/2004 (cash deposits and financial instruments), cf. the Norwegian Liens Act no. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9). 343 ----- _Solvent Enforcement_ Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is written on a promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his claim. Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee/chargee files an application to enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the involvement of the enforcement authority or a court. A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party. On May 11, 2020, the Norwegian Parliament implemented a temporary Act on restructuring (hereinafter the “Restructuring Act”) to aid businesses facing economic difficulties as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Restructuring Act is temporarily replacing Part 1 on debt negotiations of the current Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 which relates to judicial debt restructuring proceedings and will apply from the effective date until January 1, 2022. The key provisions of the Restructuring Act are as follows: (i) the institution of restructuring proceedings shall not be conditional upon the debtor being unable to pay its debts when due, (ii) creditors may, on certain conditions, file a petition for institution of restructuring proceedings, (iii) ability to fund the debtor's operations during the restructuring period, (iv) improved prospects for converting debt into equity in connection with restructuring, (v) authorization of new administrative regulations to grant exemptions from the statutory priority of corporation tax claims, value added tax claims, etc., (vi) the current requirements for equal treatment of creditors upon coluntary composition and a minimum dividend upon compulsory composition are abolished, and (vii) amendments to the provisions on adoption of a restructuring proposal. Among the most notable provisions of the Restructuring Act is the introduction of provisions conferring super-priority, i.e. priority ahead of existing security interests, on any security interest established in accounts receivable, inventories, machinery and plant, to secure loans granted to fund the continuation of operations during the restructuring period and to fund the restructuring proceedings. The Restructuring Act may have an impact on the Group’s operations in Norway.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Insolvency proceedings with respect to any Portuguese company may be initiated in Portugal. Such proceedings shall be governed pursuant to the PICRC. In addition, a Portuguese party will, in principle, be subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, Portuguese courts are entitled to open main insolvency proceedings against a Portuguese party if its COMI is located in Portugal. Such a proceeding has a universal scope and intends to cover the whole of the debtor’s assets. In the case of a company or a legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary. However, this presumption will cease to apply if the registered office has been moved to another EU Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. If the COMI of a debtor is located in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), Portuguese courts may only open “secondary insolvency proceedings”, provided that the debtor possesses an establishment in Portugal. The effects of such “secondary insolvency proceedings” are restricted to the assets of the debtor located in Portugal.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The debtor is deemed insolvent when it is unable to comply with its obligations as they fall due. Companies are also deemed insolvent when liabilities are significantly higher than assets (over-indebted balance sheet). Both 344 ----- are determined on the basis of a fair assessment. However, the insolvency proceeding may be started, for example, in the following cases: (i) general default of the debtor’s payment obligations; and (ii) the escape of the members of the board of directors, without appropriate replacements being appointed; among others. It is up to the debtor to prove its solvency with recourse to its legally mandatory account books. In addition to the standard insolvency proceedings provided in the PICRC (as better detailed below), the 2012 reform introduced a new pre-insolvency proceeding named “special revitalization procedure” (processo especial _de revitalização) (the “PER”), which was again amended in June 2017. The PER aims at facilitating the recovery_ of any debtor who owns or runs a business (all other debtors may resort to another proceeding named “Processo _Especial para Acordo de Pagamento,” which is very similar to the PER) in financial distress or in the imminence_ of becoming insolvent by means of an agreement between the debtor and its creditors. If such an agreement has been approved by the prescribed majority of creditors and has been confirmed by the court, it becomes binding to all creditors, including those who opposed the agreement. The filing for the PER is made jointly by the debtor and by creditors holding, at least, 10% of the non-subordinated credits. Moreover, the application for the PER must be instructed with a statement signed by a certified accountant or a statutory auditor, whenever the auditing of accounts is legally required, attesting that the company is not in a situation of insolvency. The insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by (i) the debtor (voluntary insolvency); (ii) any person who is responsible for the debtor’s debts; (iii) any of its creditors, whatever the nature of the credit or (iv) by the Public Prosecution Office (Ministério Público) (compulsory insolvency). Debtors have the duty to file for insolvency within 30 days upon becoming aware of the insolvency situation or after the date the debtor should be aware of the insolvency situation. Individuals who do not own a business are exempt from the duty to file for insolvency. The PICRC establishes a single main insolvency procedure, called _processo de insolvência. The insolvency proceedings may, after the insolvency’s declaration having been issued by the court, lead to the liquidation of the company or to the approval of an insolvency plan. The commencement of the insolvency proceedings is based in a written petition filed by the debtor or by any of the persons described above with the court. Where the insolvency petition is filed by the debtor (being a legal person), the following information must be therein indicated: (i) an indication as to whether the insolvency situation is existing or imminent; (ii) identification of the company’s directors and of its five major creditors, (iii) the debtor’s commercial registry certificate issued by the commercial registry office; (iv) a list of all known creditors and the details of each claim; (v) a list of all pending lawsuits brought up against the debtor; (vi) a comprehensive explanation of the company’s activities over the last three years and all the debtor’s establishments, as well as of the reasons, in the debtor’s view, that determined the insolvency situation; (vii) identification of all the shareholders, known associates or members of the debtor and those who may be legally liable for the company’s debts; (viii) a list of all company’s assets and rights; (ix) the accounting books of the company for the preceding three fiscal years; (x) a list of all the debtor’s employees; and (xi) a copy of the resolution passing the filing of the corresponding petition. Where the insolvency petition is not filed by the debtor, the petitioner shall present the information referred to in (ii) and (iii) above. If it is not possible for the petitioner to present such information, it may request the debtor to do so. The petitioner shall also justify the origin, nature and amount of its claim, or, if applicable, its liability for insolvency credits (créditos sobre a _insolvência), as well as present all information in his possession relating to the assets and debts of the debtor._ The court shall notify the debtor to submit within ten days a pleading challenging the insolvency petition. If and when the debtor does not oppose the petition, the facts described in the petition are deemed confessed and the court shall immediately declare the insolvency of the debtor if such facts are sufficient to establish that the debtor is insolvent. If the debtor submits a pleading challenging the insolvency petition, the court must schedule a hearing of the petitioner and the debtor within five days. After the hearing, the court declares the insolvency or orders the closing of the proceedings. In the declaration of insolvency, the court shall, inter alia, appoint the insolvency administrator (administrador _da insolvência) (the “Liquidator”), who will immediately take control of the debtor’s assets. The declaration of_ insolvency is registered in the civil or commercial registry (as the case may be) and is published online in a webpage run by the Portuguese Ministry of Justice, called Citius. The Liquidator has the power to collect the assets of the debtor company wherever those assets may be located.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

However, the court or the first general meeting of creditors may, in certain circumstances and at the debtor’s request, allow him to retain the management of his assets, provided that he has submitted a restructuring plan or undertakes to submit such plan within 30 days.

Creditors will be able to submit their claims by lodging their proofs of claim with the Liquidator. Creditors are entitled to challenge the Liquidator’s decisions on this subject by filing a motion with the court. All creditors have to file a proof of claim with the Liquidator within the deadline set by the court (up to 30 days from the declaration insolvency). Any creditor who fails to file a proof of claim within the prescribed deadline runs a high risk of not being acknowledged by the Liquidator and of not being paid within the insolvency proceedings, unless said creditor, provided certain requirements are met, files a special lawsuit for the acknowledgement of its claim (ação de verificação ulterior de créditos) within six months from the day when the declaration of insolvency has become final and definitive (res judicata). The court has to issue a ruling on the claims and on their ranking before any payments can be made. If no one has challenged the Liquidator’s decisions on the claims and their ranking, the court may simply confirm them. If such decisions have been challenged, the court may, if need be, hold a hearing and then rule on the subject. The PICRC distinguishes between guaranteed claims (créditos garantidos) which constitute secured claims (including special preferred claims), privileged claims (créditos privilegiados) that include general preferred claims over assets of the insolvent estate, common claims (créditos comuns) and subordinated claims (créditos _subordinados)._ Among others, the following creditors or claims enjoy some degree of priority: (i) claims from employees; (ii) court fees, including the remuneration of the Liquidator and other administrative and legal costs; (iii) taxes and social security; and (iv) creditors with security over the assets of the debtor. Before making any payments to the creditors, the Liquidator will set aside the sums or assets needed to pay off the debts of the insolvent estate (namely, expenses incurred after the declaration of insolvency in connection with the management or liquidation of the debtor’s assets). The debts of the insolvent estate are paid out of the income of the insolvent estate. If the said income proves insufficient, the remaining debts of the insolvent estate are paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the debtor’s assets. In principle, only 10% of the proceeds from the sale of assets encumbered with in rem security interests may be set aside to pay the debts of the insolvent estate. This 10% threshold may, however, be disregarded by the Liquidator if necessary to pay off all debts of the insolvent estate. After securing full payment of the debts of the insolvent estate and after the court’s ruling on the claims and their ranking has become final and definitive (res judicata), the Liquidator may begin to make payments to all other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Under certain circumstances, such acts may be rescinded on behalf of the insolvency estate, provided that they have been performed within two years prior to the filing of the insolvency proceedings. In this case, rescission is only possible if the third party has acted in bad faith.

In addition, and in cases where the acts to be carried out in the context of an enforcement proceeding (processo _executivo) or insolvency proceeding related with the judicial sale and delivery of properties are likely to damage_ the debtor's livelihood, the debtor may request the suspension of the judicial sale or delivery, provided that such suspension does not gravely harm the creditor's subsistence or causes irreparable damage, and the court must decide this incident within 10 days, after hearing the parties.

Any contract or unilateral act of the Portuguese company in breach of the aforementioned rule shall be deemed null and void, pursuant to article 322(3) of the Portuguese Companies Code and, therefore, the limitation described above on the liabilities and obligations of any Portuguese Guarantor may have the effect of reducing the amount of the obligations or liabilities assumed and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero. Pursuant to article 6.3 of the Portuguese Companies Code, the granting of any guarantee or security by a Portuguese company to secure the obligations of a third party shall be considered _ultra vires unless (i) the Portuguese company is in a group or control relationship (as such terms are defined in the Portuguese Companies Code) with the entities whose obligations are being secured (although it may be sustained that, for these purposes, both the parent and subsidiary companies must be domiciled in Portugal); or (ii) the Portuguese company has a justifiable corporate interest (justificado interesse próprio) in granting the guarantee and/or security. Please note that Portuguese law does not define the concept nor exemplifies what may be considered a justifiable corporate interest of a given company and Portuguese courts and scholars tend to use as criteria to determine the existence of justifiable corporate interest in specific situations, in particular, amongst others, the fact of whether the granting of the guarantee and/or security is necessary for the company to obtain a potential economic benefit/advantage or to avoid a loss. Therefore, in the event any Portuguese company is considered not to have a justifiable corporate interest in the granting of guarantees and/or security to secure the obligations of the Issuers, such guarantees and/or security may not be enforceable under Portuguese law. The documentation in relation to the guarantees and security, to the extent they concern a Portuguese Guarantor, may contain limitation language and, hence, such guarantees and security interests are limited in the manner described therein.

The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Portuguese courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts is subject to: - the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable under their governing law; - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off, fraud, abuse of rights (abuso de direito), violation of public policy principles, duress, misrepresentation, undue influence, conflict of interests, force majeure, exception non adimplenti contractus, error, abatement and counterclaim; and - the applicable statute of limitations. As a general rule, under Portuguese law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another obligation to which it is ancillary (princípio da acessoriedade), which must be clearly identified in the relevant 348 ----- guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that the invalidity of the underlying obligation entails invalidity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Portuguese courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or security are not enforceable. The enforcement of security (including a guarantee) before the Portuguese courts will be subject to the following: - a Portuguese court may refuse to give effect to any provision of the relevant agreements on the grounds that such provision conflicts with Portuguese public policy (ordem pública); - the Portuguese courts will not grant enforcement in the event that they deem that a right has been exercised in abuse of right (abuso de direito) and will not enforce an obligation in case of fraud; - a Portuguese court may issue an award of damages where specific performance is deemed impracticable; and - a Portuguese court may not enforce a penalty clause within the meaning of article 812 of the Portuguese Civil Code which the court would consider excessive as a pre-estimate of damages or if the obligations secured by the penalty clause have been performed in part; in this event the court may reduce the amount of the penalty. The principles above mentioned are of general application and in applying such principles a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial. Finally, it should be noted that Portuguese Guarantors will be entitled to claim for themselves immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process in respect of its obligations under the Collateral to the extent that their assets are covered by the immunities legally set forth, which include, but are not limited to, assets that are part of the public domain of the Portuguese Republic (domínio público do Estado) or allocated to public service purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

In addition, to the_ extent that the registered office or their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France or they have an establishment in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings being either safeguard (sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde accélérée), accelerated financial safeguard (sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). Specialized courts exist for conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to (i) debtors that exceed (directly or through the companies under their control) (y) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (z) €40 million in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where 349 ----- the EU Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of this group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds). Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group._ In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the Notes Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests in the Collateral. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings. The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes. Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the Restructuring Directive into French law with respect to which French statute n° 2019-486 dated 22 May 2019 (“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it should be noted that Order No. 2020-341 of 27 March 2020 (“Order No. 2020-341”), Order No. 2020-596 of 20 May 2020, (“Order No. 2020-596”) and Order No. 2020-1443 of 25 November 2020 (“Order No. 2020-1443”) have modified rules concerning companies and agricultural businesses’ difficulties in order to adapt some provisions of Book VI of the French Commercial Code. Most of the measures under Order No. 2020-596 and all the measures under Order No. 2020-1443 will apply until 31 December 2021 included. _Grace periods_ In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil). Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published annually by decree) or that payments made shall first be allocated to the repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or other penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. When the debtor benefits from conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, these statutory provisions shall be read in combination with Article L. 611-7 and Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (see “Court-assisted Proceedings” below). _Insolvency test_ Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria. The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an 350 ----- agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see below). Order No. 2020-341, as amended by Order No. 2020-596, provides that, until 23 August 2020 inclusive, the debtor’s insolvency was to be assessed as at 12 March 2020. However, the assessment of the date of insolvency on 12 March 2020 did not preclude the possibility of setting the date of insolvency earlier. _Court-assisted proceedings_ A French debtor facing difficulties may request the commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad _hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders. Mandat ad hoc and conciliation are proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the court,_ which do not involve any stay of enforcement against the debtor. _Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties provided that they are not_ insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal, confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those who have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, as set forth above. The agreement reached is reported to the court but is not formally approved by it. The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of_ a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “Insolvency test” above) or has not been in a state of insolvency for more than 45 calendar days. _Conciliation proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliateur may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). According to Order No. 2020-341, as amended by Order No. 2020-596, conciliation proceedings opened by the president of the Court until 23 August 2020 were automatically extended for a five-month duration and, according to Order No. 2020-1443, the duration of conciliation proceedings opened on or after 24 August 2020 may be extended, one or more times, at the request of the conciliator, by a motivated decision of the president of the court, for a maximum duration of 10 months, until 31 December 2021 included. The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or _liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition before the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced _conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose such grace periods on any creditor having participated in the _conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for its claims that were not dealt with in the _conciliation agreement for which such creditor 351 ----- initiates legal action for payment, such decision being taken after hearing the _conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement. However, pursuant to Order No. 2020-596, as amended by Law No. 2020-1525, until 31 December 2021 included, the debtor in conciliation may ask the president of the court, having opened the proceedings, to rule by order on request: (i) to interrupt or prohibit any legal proceedings from a creditor seeking an order against the debtor for the payment of a sum of money or the termination of a contract for a default of payment, (ii) to stop or prohibit any enforcement proceedings from a creditor on both movable and immovable property, as well as any distribution proceedings which did not have an allocating effect prior to the application and (iii) to postpone or defer the payment of due liabilities. This mechanism may be combined with the request for grace periods, which can be obtained under some favorable conditions: the debtor can request the judge to apply Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code prior any formal notice being served or legal action being filed by a creditor who did not accept, within the time limit determined by the conciliator, the request made by the conciliator to postpone the due date of payment of his claim. The _conciliation agreement reached between the debtor and its creditors and/or trade partners party to the agreement may be either acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the _conciliation proceedings remain confidential._ Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate); - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below- see “The hardening period (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and _liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_ (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). 352 ----- Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force: - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and - a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors that is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or_ (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. _Court-administered proceedings—safeguard_ A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (en état de _cessation des paiements). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of nor do they attend the hearing before the_ court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed. At the request of the debtor or the public prosecutor or by the court on its own, two or more administrators can be appointed. The appointment of several administrators is mandatory when the debtor (i) owns at least three establishements outside the jurisdiction of the court where it is registered, or (ii) holds or controls (as provided by Article L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) at least two companies subject to court-administered proceedings, or (iii) is held or controlled (as provided by the same articles) by a company subject to court-administered proceedings, such company itself holding or controlling another company subject to such proceedings, and (iv) generates at least 20 million euros of net turnover (for (ii) and (iii)). In case mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings were commenced before the commencement of court-administered proceedings, the public prosecutor can object to the appointment of the mandataire ad hoc or conciliator as 353 ----- administrator. The administrator is appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months, and to help the debtor elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will propose to its creditors. The observation period was automatically extended for a three-month duration for safeguard proceedings opened until 23 August 2020 included, pursuant to Order No. 2020-341, as amended by Order No. 2020-596. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed administrator who will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment, exercise ex post _facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor in making all or_ some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. The insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) can appoint one to five controllers (contrôleurs) among the creditors who have filed a request, provided they meet certain conditions (in particular no affiliation to the debtor). If more than one controller is appointed, at least one must be chosen among secured creditors and at least one must be chosen among unsecured creditors. Controllers assist the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) in his duties and assist the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) in his duty of supervising the management of the business. In order to protect creditors’ interests and under certain conditions, the controllers may act in the interests of the creditors when the creditor’s representative fails to take sufficient action. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: (i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) (b), the court may act upon its own initiative; and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and if they do not relate to expenses necessary for the debtor’s business activities during the observation period (see above), are not for the requirements of the proceedings, or are not in consideration for services rendered or goods delivered to the debtor during this period is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine _fiduciaire)._ Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor_ or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have less than 150 employees or less or €20 million of turnover or less unless, upon theirs or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below). In the standard consultation procedure, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, 354 ----- regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific different position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of the claim over the length of the plan (initial duration of ten years maximum subject to further extension of the duration of the plan pursuant to Order No. 2020-341 and Order No. 2020-596 (cf. below), except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved do not need to be consulted. Creditors consulted in writing which do not respond within 30 days are deemed to have accepted the proposal (except debt-for-equity swaps). Until 31 December 2021 included, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative, the supervisory judge may reduce from 30 days to 15 days the time limits applied to creditors consulted in writing (Order No. 2020-596, as amended by Law No. 20201525).The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused proposals that were_ submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals for which the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without its creditor’s individual acceptance. Pursuant to Order No. 2020-341, the duration of an ongoing safeguard plan and any safeguard plan sanctioned before 23 August 2020 may be extended from 24 August and for a period of six months (i.e. 23 February 2021), the plan implementation officer or the Public Prosecutor may request the extension of the plan for one year. It should be noted that, the duration of ongoing plans or plans adopted until 23 June 2020 is automatically extended by three months. Pursuant to Order No. 2020-596, as amended by Law No. 2020-1525, the duration of ongoing safeguard plans and safeguard plans to be sanctioned before 31 December 2021 can be extended for a maximum time period of two years. This two-year time period may be added to the term of the automatic and optional extensions set out above. For each case of extension of the duration of the plan, the president of the court or the court shall adapt the payment deadlines initially adopted by the court to the new duration of the extended plan. The duration of the plan may be extended from ten to twelve years in the event of a substantial amendment (modification _substantielle) in the objectives or the means of the plan. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first_ payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. _Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies (whose accounts are certified by a statutory_ auditor or established by a chartered-accountant and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million), or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees have to be established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the debts that arose prior to the initial judgment: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities (including shareholders) having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (or their successors) (the “credit institutions committee”); and 355 ----- - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of _obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances and of the governing law of those obligations (the “Bondholders’ General Meeting”). As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general meeting. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Order No. 2020-596 introduce a post-money privilege for those who make a new cash contribution to the debtor either during the observation period or as part of the safeguard plan (these cash injections will be mentioned in the judgment which adopts or modifies the plan). Contributions made by the debtor's shareholders in the context of a capital increase are excluded from the safeguard privilege. Creditors benefiting from the safeguard privilege are paid for the amount of their contribution: (i) by priority, before all others claims and in the order provided for under paragraph III of Article L. 622-17 and paragraph III of Article L. 641-13 of the French Commercial Code and claims secured by the safeguard privilege cannot be subject to deferred payment maturities or write-off, unless the creditors expressly agreed to them. These measures are applicable to ongoing proceedings and to proceedings opened between the date of entry into force of the Ordonnance No. 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 (i.e. 21 May 2020) and 31 December 2021 included. Creditors which are members of the credit institutions’ committee or the suppliers’ committee may submit to the court an alternative plan under safeguard proceedings, it being specified that approval of these alternative plans is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the Bondholders General Meeting (although the law does not provide the same rights for the bondholders to present an alternative plan). The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission which can be reduced to a minimum of 15 days, subject to the insolvency judge’s (juge commissaire) authorization. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee, provided that the majority is two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. Each creditor member of a creditors committee and each holder of the Notes member of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote, to the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to the creditor/holder of the Notes a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/Bondholders General Meeting. In the event of a disagreement, the creditor/note holder or the court-appointed administrator may request that the matter be decided by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings. The amounts of the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) constituted as a guarantee granted by the debtor are not taken into account to determine voting rights in the committees or in the general meeting of all holders of such debt securities. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the 356 ----- plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the Bondholders’ General Meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the Bondholders’ General Meeting and determination of a rescheduling of the claim of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. In considering such approval, the court has to verify that the interests of all creditors are sufficiently protected and that relevant shareholder consent, if any is required, has been obtained. Once approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees, and, if applicable, the general bondholders meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. _Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social security_ and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. _Court-administered proceedings—accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard_ A debtor that is engaged in _conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure _de sauvegarde financière accélérée)._ The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard procedures have been designed to “fast-track” difficulties of large companies i.e. those (i) whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by an accountant (expert comptable) and having more than 20 employees or a, turnover (excluding VAT) greater than €3 million or whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million or (ii) that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code. If the debtor does not exceed the provided thresholds to constitute a creditors’ committee (see above), the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. Pursuant to Order No. 2020-596, as amended by Law No. 2020-1525, the provided thresholds are not applicable to ongoing proceedings and to proceedings opened between the date of entry into force of Order No. 2020-596 (i.e. 21 May 2020) and 31 December 2021 included. 357 ----- To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill five conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days prior to the commencement of the _conciliation proceedings;_ - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; - the debtor must exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above) or the court shall have authorized such constitution in the opening decision; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his business as a going concern supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) and Bondholders General Meeting (if any) within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (or within a maximum of two months of the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de _sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee,_ but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “committee-based _consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated_ safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). In particular, the creditors committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of it being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadlines, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. 358 ----- The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor and shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below). _Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_ Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, with respect to liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for _conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it does not, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requests the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may consider judicial liquidation proceedings and order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator is usually appointed by the court (administrateur judiciaire) to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (except in case of application of the COVID-19 three-month specific extension of the observation period), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a reorganization plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The debtor requesting the opening of reorganization proceedings is (as in safeguard proceedings) authorized to suggest the name of one or more administrators to the court. The debtor is thus able to request the appointment of the judicial administrator who previously assisted them during safeguard proceedings that have been converted into judicial reorganization proceedings. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). Regarding COVID-19 specific measures, Order No. 2020-341, Order No. 2020-596 and Order No. 2020-1443 apply in the same way in safeguard and reorganization proceedings. At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the state prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and vote on behalf of the shareholders which refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the 359 ----- total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise), in which case the court will usually appoint a court-appointed administrator during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) to manage the debtor and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession), any third party being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; or - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: - launch auction sales; - sell on an amicable basis each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). 360 ----- If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event that there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. _The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings_ The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The date of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the “période _suspecte” (otherwise referred to as “hardening period”), being the period between the date of insolvency and_ the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period may be void or voidable by the Court. - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no, or nominal, consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts (including a security granted to secure a guarantee obligation) previously incurred and provisional attachment or seizure measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, transfers into a trust (fiducie) (unless the transfer is made as a security for indebtedness simultaneously incurred), modifications to existing transfers into a trust securing previous debts, and a declaration of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, notices of attachment made to third-parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie _attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that_ the creditor knew of the insolvency of the debtor. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. _Status of creditors during safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings_ Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to 361 ----- terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. The court-appointed administrator can, conversely, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) as described above, in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or, during the observation period, against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determines the amount due, in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; and - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en _cours) will be required._ However, a natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan _de redressement”)._ In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. 362 ----- As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, unless with respect to very limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim during the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its accountant). Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust, if necessary, the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the _conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset. _Creditors’ liability_ Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, or (ii) wrongfully interfered with the management of the debtor or (iii) obtained security or guarantees that are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In France, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account 363 ----- (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de _compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will_ have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre _de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security_ interests which are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered. With respect to a French law pledge of shares (parts sociales) issued by a company in the form of a société en nom collectif or a société à responsabilité limitée, it will only be legally perfected and binding (opposable) against third parties when such pledge has been filed with the Trade Registry of the Commercial Court of the place of registration of such company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,852,INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL,852.6,France,852.6.3,Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”),"Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court- appointed expert in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or judicially- appointed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). 364 ----- There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indentures that become particularly important following defaults or events of default under the Indentures, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code by Article 792-0 bis of the French Code _général des impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published_ decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, inter alios, the Trustee or the Senior Notes Trustee, as applicable. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The _action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so, (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests 365 ----- in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered. Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a lower ranking pledge thereon. The lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers convenus” (entiercement), that the first ranking or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the creation of lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as _tiers convenus and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking or lower ranking secured parties. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore there is a risk that the lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an acceleration event.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Under French financial assistance rules, a company incorporated as a société anonyme or a société par action _simplifiée is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly,_ for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, the aggregate obligations and liabilities of a French Guarantor under its guarantee for the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes, its guarantee of the Senior Notes and its guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and the amounts recoverable thereunder shall be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts borrowed directly (as borrower under the Senior Credit Facilities, as the case may be) or indirectly under On-Lending Facilities (as defined below) by that French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries and outstanding from time to time (the “Maximum Guaranteed Amount”); it being specified that any payment made by any such French Guarantor under its guarantee or under its Senior Credit Facilities guarantee or under its Senior Notes guarantee shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans (if any) due by such French Guarantor under such On-Lending Facilities. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by a French Guarantor under the On-Lending Facilities shall reduce the Maximum Guaranteed Amount. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its guarantees. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. “On-Lending Facilities” means, in respect of a French Guarantor, the loans made available to such French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries as borrowers (including all interest, commissions, costs, fees, expenses and other sums accruing or payable in connection with such amount) to the extent that such loans are financed by way of amounts which are made available to such French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries by a borrower under the Senior Credit Facilities with the proceeds of the Senior Credit Facilities and/or by the Senior Notes Issuer with the proceeds of the Senior Notes and/or by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes, and on-lent (either directly or through one or more other subsidiaries of the borrower of the Senior Credit Facilities and/or of the Senior Notes Issuer and/or of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) to, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to, such French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

These laws may adversely affect the enforcement of a holder’s rights under the Notes and may not be as favorable to their interests as a creditor as the laws of other jurisdictions. In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated, and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors based on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale of a going concern. Pursuant to the Danish Bankruptcy Act (Consolidated Act No. 11 of 6 January 2014 as amended, in Danish: “konkursloven”), bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is unable to fulfil its obligations as they fall due and that the insolvency is not temporary based on an assessment of the debtor’s liquidity status. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s creditors. The principle is, however, to some extent modified by the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy. Some claims (certain preferential and privileged claims) rank before ordinary claims and other claims (certain subordinated claims) rank below ordinary claims. The status of a claim is dependent upon express statutory authority (except for subordinated loans, which by contract are subordinated). Preferential claims primarily include costs and expenses involved in the administration of the bankruptcy estate and debts approved by an administrator during a suspension period. Privileged claims are mainly salary claims (excluding salary claims from the top management), including salary income taxes relating thereto. Most tax claims are ordinary claims. Interest accrued on ordinary claims will rank as ordinary claims up to the date of the bankruptcy adjudication, after which date the accrued interest will rank as a subordinated claim. Danish bankruptcy law contains several provisions enabling the trustee in bankruptcy to initiate proceedings to have certain transactions prior to the bankruptcy avoided. Most avoidance provisions contain time limits, which are generally three or six months, but such periods are extended (i) up to two years if (inter _alia) a transaction has been made to the benefit of a person or entity closely related to the debtor and/or (ii) for_ an indefinite period if the debtor was or became insolvent or unable to pay its debts due to the transaction and if the transaction is deemed improper. Payments made by unusual means and payments made before they are due or in amounts that have had a distinctly impairing effect on the debtor’s ability to pay its debts, are typically subject to avoidance. In addition, all types of charges, mortgages and other types of security that were not granted to the creditor at the time the debt was incurred or that were not perfected without undue delay after the time the debt was incurred will generally be subject to avoidance. Under Danish bankruptcy law the issuance of guarantees may also be subject to avoidance if, among other things (i) the issuance was made at a time when the issuer was insolvent, (ii) the issuance is without due consideration and/or (iii) between closely related parties. A creditor who wishes to raise a claim for avoidance may do so through the trustees in bankruptcy, who must litigate the matter under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts (not the bankruptcy court). As a general rule, such legal proceedings must be initiated within twelve months after the declaration of the bankruptcy adjudication. In the event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be converted into Danish kroner using the Danish National Bank’s (Nationalbanken) official exchange rate for the relevant currency against Danish kroner as at the date of declaration of bankruptcy by the Danish bankruptcy court. 368 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The creditor’s meeting is scheduled to a date after the bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated and the proceedings haven been opened. The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is normally the case. The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules set out in the Danish Bankruptcy Act. The trustee must not be a related party of the debtor or otherwise dependent on the debtor and there must not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. As a further general rule, the bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee.

Reconstruction proceedings are an alternative to bankruptcy proceedings for companies. During the reconstruction procedure, creditors are restricted in their ability to enforce their claims, but valid and binding security may be enforced under certain conditions. A company as well as a creditor may file an application for restructuring with the bankruptcy court. The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the company operates its business. For the bankruptcy court to initiate a restructuring process it is required that the company is unable to fulfil its obligations as they fall due (and that the insolvency is not temporary) as further described in the section above entitled “Bankruptcy” above. The main purpose of the restructuring is for an otherwise healthy company to overcome the insolvency. A restructuring must involve a compulsory composition/moratorium and/or a business transfer or a combination of both. When a restructuring process is initiated, the bankruptcy court will appoint a restructuring administrator and an accountant. The administrator shall, inter alia, prepare a restructuring plan and, together with the court-appointed accountant, a final restructuring proposal. A meeting shall be held at the bankruptcy court where the creditors must vote on the final restructuring proposal. If the restructuring process does not result in a compulsory composition/moratorium and/or a business transfer or a combination of both that is adopted by the creditors, the bankruptcy court will commence bankruptcy proceedings. The restructuring will, however, be lifted if the debtor becomes solvent during the proceedings. As a result of the restructuring, the debtor will be protected against claims for payment by his creditors during the restructuring.

Transactions favoring particular creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors pursuant to the statutory priority of claims may include, among other things, payment by unusual means of payment, payments made in advance of the due date of the debt or payments that have critically deteriorated the debtor’s ability to pay, in each case provided that the relevant payment did not appear to be ordinary, or the provision of security for debts already incurred (known as “old debt”). Below is a summary of (i) the avoidance rule relating to security for old debt and (ii) the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions. Other avoidance rules are not summarized herein. Pursuant to Section 70 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, any security interest which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the incurrence of the underlying secured debt, or which is not duly perfected without undue delay after the incurrence of the underlying secured debt, can be avoided if the relevant act of perfection is completed later than the date falling three months prior to the “deadline date” (in Danish: “fristdagen”). The deadline date is further defined in Section 1 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act. In practice, the deadline date will often be the date on which the bankruptcy court received a petition for reconstruction proceedings or bankruptcy. The hardening period of three months is extended to two years if the security is provided in favor of a related party of the debtor unless it is proven that the debtor neither was, nor upon creation of the security became, insolvent. Pursuant to Section 74 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act (known as the “general clause” (in Danish: _“generalklausulen”)), any disposition which unduly favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or_ whereby the debtor’s property is prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the debtor’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the debtor was, or by the disposition became, insolvent, and the favored party knew or ought to have known about the debtor’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the disposition “improper” (in Danish: “utilbørlig”). For these purposes, transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behavior will generally be deemed improper. Improper behavior may be any such behavior which is contrary to the purpose of insolvency proceedings, for example, where a creditor should have realized that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to satisfaction of their claims.

The insolvency laws of Switzerland may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Switzerland. In the event that Swiss guarantors experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to Swiss insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the case under United States, Swedish or any other non-Swiss bankruptcy laws. Under Swiss law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against an entity having its registered office or assets in Switzerland. In the event of a Swiss entity’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would be governed by Swiss law as a result of such Swiss entity’s offices being registered in the competent commercial register in Switzerland. In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over assets of a foreign entity located in Switzerland. The enforcement of claims and questions relating to insolvency and bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy, as amended from time to time. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of bankruptcy (Konkurs) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets, even if located outside Switzerland, and liabilities of the debtor. However, with regard to assets located outside Switzerland, a Swiss bankruptcy decree is enforceable only if it is recognized at the place where such assets are located. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special 371 ----- enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed on a private liquidation. However, if bankruptcy is declared while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer permitted. As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt enforcement procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons by local debt enforcement authorities (Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior proceedings if the following requirements are met: (i) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors or the auditors of the company (in case of failure of the board of directors) declare that the debtor is overindebted (überschuldet) within the meaning of art. 725 (2) of the Swiss Code of Obligations (or the corresponding provision of the Swiss Code of Obligations in case of a limited liability company (GmbH)) or if it declares to be insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), and (ii) at the request of a creditor, if the debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of its creditors or ceases to make payments (Zahlungseinstellung) or if certain events happen during composition proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung) which will draw up an inventory of the assets and, further to a creditors’ call for the filing of claims, establish a schedule of claims (Kollokationsplan). All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently form the bankrupt estate which, after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, is used to satisfy the creditors. However, in respect of assets located abroad, the Swiss authorities do not have jurisdiction to collect such assets for the purpose of including them in the Swiss bankruptcy estate of the debtor. It is therefore the foreign law applicable at the place where the assets are located abroad, or treaties between Switzerland and the state in which such assets are located, that will determine whether and to what extent the foreign authorities can assist in the collection of these assets. Assets of the bankrupt estate over which a pledge was created in favor of a creditor before the declaration of bankruptcy are included in the bankrupt estate. The pledgee is under an obligation to remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate. The assets are liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy in the same manner as the other assets of the bankrupt estate, but the creditor secured by the pledge retains its privilege to be satisfied from the proceeds of the liquidation of the assets pledged to it with priority over the unsecured creditors. Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The first and the second class, which are privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident insurance, pension plans, family law and claims for deposits under the Swiss banking act. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class. A secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral. If the enforcement proceeds are not sufficient to fully satisfy the secured claims, the remainder of the claims have equal rank as unsecured claims with all other unsecured and (provided it is not a privileged claim) non-prioritized claims. If several pledges secure the same claim, the amount realized is applied proportionally to the claim. Any creditor wishing to contest the schedule of claims because his claim has been entirely or partially rejected by the receiver in bankruptcy or not allocated in the rank requested must bring an action against the estate before the competent court. If any creditor wishes to contest the admission of another creditor to the schedule of claims or the allocated rank, he must bring an action against such creditor. Such court proceedings could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a liquidation under U.S. bankruptcy law. Such proceedings could also cause payment to the holders of the Notes to be delayed, as compared with holders of undisputed claims. Claims assigned for security purposes by a Swiss entity that came into existence prior to the opening of bankruptcy can be enforced by the assignee outside Swiss bankruptcy proceedings, subject to potential avoidance actions. According to the current jurisprudence of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, assigned claims that come into existence after the opening of bankruptcy over a Swiss entity or similar insolvency proceedings that lead to the loss of the capacity of the relevant assignor to dispose of such rights or claims may generally not be enforceable by the secured creditor. Guarantees by Swiss guarantors (the “Swiss Guarantees”) are, based on a choice of law, subject to the laws of the state of New York. Should a Swiss court accept jurisdiction in proceedings on the merits, a Swiss court will generally recognize the choice of law. The scope of such choice of law is, usually, limited to the rules of the substantive law chosen by the parties; as to procedural matters, a Swiss court will apply Swiss procedural law. Due to the different nature of Swiss procedural law and the procedural law in common law jurisdictions (such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom) classification and delimitation issues between 372 ----- substantive and procedural law could occur. To establish the non-Swiss substantive law applicable to the merits, a Swiss court may, in pecuniary matters, request the parties to establish the non-Swiss substantive law; Swiss law will be applied, if the content of the foreign substantive law cannot be established. While a Swiss court will generally accept a choice of law, restrictively applied exceptions exist: Swiss courts may diverge from the chosen substantive law if such chosen law would lead to a result contrary to Swiss public policy, if the purpose of mandatory rules of Swiss law require, by their special aim, immediate application, or if the purpose of mandatory rules of another law, to which the dispute is closely connected, are considered legitimate under Swiss legal concepts and, upon weighing the interests of the parties involved, the clearly predominant interest(s) of one party so require. Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors. Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a stay (Nachlassstundung) pending negotiation of the composition agreement with the creditors and confirmation of such agreement by the competent court. A distinction is made between a composition agreement providing for the assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) which leads to a private liquidation and in many instances has analogous effects as a bankruptcy, and a dividend composition (Dividenden-Vergleich) providing for the payment of a certain percentage on the creditors’ claims and the continuation of the debtor. Further, there is the possibility of a composition in the form of a mere payment term extension (Stundungsvergleich). During a moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending proceedings are stayed. An assignment of claims for security purposes entered into by a Swiss entity prior to the granting of a moratorium is ineffective if the assigned claims come into existence only after the granting of a moratorium. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). The moratorium aims at facilitating the conclusion of one of the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims. Foreign bankruptcy decrees issued in the country of a debtor’s domicile may be recognized in Switzerland only, provided that (i) the bankruptcy decree is enforceable in the country where it was issued, (ii) its recognition is, _inter alia, not against Swiss public policy, and (iii) it was either issued in the country of the debtor' domicile or in_ the country where the debtor has its center of main interest, provided that the debtor was not domiciled in Switzerland at the time the foreign bankruptcy proceedings were initiated.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

In particular, since the Swiss Guarantees constitute obligations/guarantees for liabilities of direct or indirect shareholders (so-called “upstream obligations/guarantees”), the liability of the Swiss Guarantors under the Swiss Guarantees is limited under Swiss law (i) insofar as such upstream obligations/guarantees must be within the corporate purpose and interests of such Swiss Guarantor and (ii) to the amount of such Swiss Guarantor’s freely disposable equity, being the balance sheet profits and non-statutory reserves available for the distribution as dividends at the time of enforcement of the Swiss Guarantees. The payment of dividends from the Swiss Guarantors to the Issuers will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Swiss Guarantees. Also, following a recent decision by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, the distributable reserves of the Swiss Guarantors may be reduced by the amount of any upstream or cross-stream intercompany loan provided by Swiss Guarantors which is not at arm’s length terms. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_ A Swiss Guarantor is under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if a Swiss Guarantor has distributable profits and reserves, such Swiss Guarantor may make dividend payments that reduce its distributable profits and reserves to zero. Since a Swiss Guarantor may pay dividends to service indebtedness and for tax-planning purposes. There can be no assurance that a Swiss Guarantor will have 373 ----- distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Swiss Guarantees, whether or not such dividend payments are made. The payment of dividends to service debt obligations of a Swiss Guarantor (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Swiss Guarantees. In addition, the enforcement of upstream obligations (i.e. payment under the Swiss Guarantees by the Swiss Guarantors) may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report determining the freely distributable reserves at the time of enforcement under then applicable law, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. In addition, financial assistance rules are uncertain under Swiss law. The Swiss Guarantors cannot provide any assurance that future court rulings will not further restrict the enforceability, or deny the validity, of guarantees. Such rulings would negatively affect the ability to enforce the guarantees granted by Swiss Guarantors. Further, Swiss corporate law rules may significantly impact the value of the Swiss Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The avoidance may relate to (i) gifts and gratuitous transactions made in the suspect period of twelve months prior to being declared bankrupt or the grant of a moratorium, (ii) certain acts of a debtor (e.g. repayment of a debt which has not yet fallen due, settlement of a debt by unusual means of payment, granting of a collateral for previously unsecured liabilities without previously being obliged to do so) in the suspect period of twelve months prior to being declared bankrupt or the grant of a moratorium if the debtor at that time was over-indebted, and (iii) dispositions made by the debtor within a suspect period of five years prior to being declared bankrupt or the grant of a moratorium with the intent, identifiable by the other party, to disadvantage its creditors or to prefer certain of its creditors to the detriment of other creditors. In case of an avoidance action regarding a disposition in favor of an affiliated person, including a group company, the favored person bears the burden of proof that the intent of disadvantaging the creditors was not identifiable. In case of successful avoidance, the relevant creditors (such as holders of the Notes) are under an obligation to repay the amounts received. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Swiss Guarantor’s Guarantee. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the Swiss Guarantee may become unenforceable and any amounts received by the holders of the Notes under a guarantee that is avoided must be refunded by the holders of the Notes to the insolvent estate. The holders of the Notes who have restituted the avoided amount paid to them regain their original claim against the Swiss Guarantor and are entitled to list their claim in the schedule of claims in their respective rank and priority.

Nordea Bank Abp’s ability to engage in U.S. securities dealings is limited under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act and it may not offer or sell securities that are offered or sold in the United States. Nordea Bank Abp will only offer and sell the Notes that are part of its allotment solely outside the United States. CaixaBank, S.A. is only participating in the Offering outside the United States under Regulation S. CaixaBank, S.A. is not a broker dealer registered with the SEC nor has an agreement with a registered broker dealer for such purposes and will not be offering or selling securities in the United States or to U.S. nationals or residents unless it is through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to certain conditions precedents, including, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. None of the Issuers or the Guarantors will for a period of 90 days following the time when sales of Notes were first made, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of, or guarantees by, the Issuers or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates that are substantially similar to the Notes without the prior written consent of the relevant representative. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the Offering price and other selling terms of each series of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the latter of the Issue Date and the date on which the Notes were first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Regulation S), an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering of the Notes) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

See “Important Information” and “Transfer Restrictions.” One or more Initial Purchasers may make offers or sales of the Notes in the United States through an affiliate or any other U.S. registered broker-dealers pursuant to applicable U.S. securities laws. The Notes and the Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Securities Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Securities Official List of the Exchange or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—An active trading market _may not develop for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial Offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. _Stabilization_ In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—An active trading market may _not develop for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, provide currently and may provide in the future, commercial lending and banking, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuers, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees, commissions and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders or agents under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the 2015 Senior Term Loans and the Senior Credit Facilities, in connection with which they receive certain fees and commissions, or are otherwise holders of the Existing Notes or otherwise act as solicitation agents in connection 376 ----- with the Consent Solicitation. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Financing to repay the 2015 Senior Term Loans in full and redeem all of the Existing Senior Notes. To the extent that the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the 2015 Senior Term Loans or Holders of the Existing Senior Notes, they will receive a portion of the proceeds of the Financing. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve investments or securities of the Issuers, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the Issue Date, which will be six Euroclear or Clearstream business days and five U.S. business days following the date of pricing of the Notes due to disparate non-business days between Euroclear and Clearstream on the one hand and the United States on the other hand (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+6” outside the United States and “T+5” in the United States). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next two U.S. business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement code at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.

It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (tingsrätt). Pursuant to the 2012 Brussels Regulation, if a judgment contains a measure or an order which is not known under the laws of the Member State in which the recognition of the judgment is invoked or in which the enforcement of the judgment, the court settlement or the authentic instrument is sought, that measure or order shall, to the extent possible, be adapted to a measure or order known under the laws of that Member State which has equivalent effects attached to it and which pursues similar aims and interests. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Contracting Party, will, provided that a motion for enforcement has been filed and granted with the relevant district court, be enforceable in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under the Lugano Convention. A judgment entered against a Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention, a Member State (as defined in the 2012 Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention), for example, the United States, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial on its merits. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by the courts of such state, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden. In order to enforce any such judgement in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by the courts of such state may be regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability, the translation into Swedish of any relevant document. Further assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations. Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor. 383 ----- It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish Party giving such powers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

These provisions set out that any unappealable judgment rendered outside of Spain (apart from countries bound by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters) may be recognized and enforced in Spain pursuant to the following regimes: (i) in accordance with any applicable international treaty, or (ii) in the absence of any such treaty, when the requirements in Title V of Law 29/2015, including those applicable to exequatur proceedings, are complied with (basically, that the judgment must be final, translated into Spanish and apostilled). The foregoing is without prejudice to any special rules applicable under Spanish law (for example, the insolvency regime). Law 29/2015 expressly prohibits the competent Spanish court from reviewing a foreign judgment on the merits (revisión sobre el fondo). Since there is no applicable treaty between Spain and the United States of America, the conditions referred to in point (ii) in the above paragraph must be satisfied in order to recognize and enforce an unappealable judgment of a United States court in Spain. These conditions require that none of the following circumstances concur: - that the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (órden público); - that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching the rights of defence of any of the parties and, in particular, if the judgment has been rendered by default of the defendant (en rebeldía) it would be deemed to breach his rights of defence if the defendant was not regularly and timely notified to enable him to defend himself properly; - that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish Courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute; - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another Spanish judgment; - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgment which meets the requirements to be enforceable in Spain; - that there is an on-going proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same subject which was opened before a Spanish Court prior to the opening of the proceedings before the foreign court; - that the foreign judgment does not meet the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law if any of the Issuers is subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain; or - that the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is not duly apostilled. According to Article 3.2 of Law 29/2015 the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with other state’s authorities if there has been a repeated refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States of America could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Issuers or Guarantors, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the Issuers or any of the Guarantors in 384 ----- any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 Decembe 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby. Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized and enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) which must be filed with the relevant Spanish First Instance Court (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil). The competence to hear applications for exequatur corresponds to the trial courts of the domicile of the party against which the recognition or enforcement is sought, or of the person who referred to the effects of the foreign judgment. Secondarily, the territorial jurisdiction shall be determined by the place of execution or the place in which resolution should produce its effects, being competent, in the latter case, the Court of first instance before which stands the demand for exequatur. If the part that calls the exequatur was subject to bankruptcy process in Spain and judgment had aimed some of the material competence of the judge of the competition, the competition to meet the request for exequatur will be up to the judge of the competition and shall be dealt with by the procedures of the bankruptcy incident. Additionally, pursuant to Article 54 of the current Civil Procedure Law the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the Civil Procedure Law and the Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute); therefore such article does not cover the validity of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts. Once a judgment has been recognised under the exequatur procedure, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Civil Procedure Law; in particular, the deadline for filing enforcement requests will be applicable (5 years). The enforcement of any judgments in Spain involves, _inter alia, the following principal actions and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled; (c) certain professional fees required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain (if needed); (d) certain court fees and/or judicial taxes must be paid; (e) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (f) the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts (which could, again, entail certain costs). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and such rules will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the relevant agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicted solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Portugal. A final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court for the payment of a specific sum of money would be enforceable in the courts of Portugal, after having been confirmed by a Portuguese court, as set forth in the Portuguese Code of Civil Procedure (Código de Processo Civil). The Portuguese court with jurisdiction over such confirmation would be the Court of Appeal (Tribunal da _Relação) of the judicial district where the relevant person against whom the judgment will be enforced is_ domiciled. Pursuant to the Portuguese Code of Civil Procedure (Código de Processo Civil), in order for the judgment rendered in the U.S. federal or state courts to be enforceable, the following conditions must be met: - there should be no doubts regarding the authenticity or the reasoning of the judgement; - the judgment is final (res judicata) according to the applicable U.S. federal or state laws; - the U.S. federal or state courts jurisdiction was not established fraudulently and the judgement does not relate to a matter over which Portuguese courts have exclusive jurisdiction; - _lis pendens and condition of res judicata cannot be alleged based on a case pending or judged on a Portuguese court, except if the foreign U.S. federal or state courts prevented the jurisdiction; - the defendant was duly notified of the proceedings, under the U.S. federal or state laws, and the adversarial nature of proceedings and the principle of equality of the parties were duly complied with during the proceedings; and - the judgment rendered is not incompatible with the international public policy of the Portuguese State. If a judgment by a U.S. federal or state court is issued against a Portuguese national (either an individual or a company), its confirmation may also be challenged whenever its final outcome is less favorable to the Portuguese party than it would have been if the relevant court had applied Portuguese law (provided that, according to the Portuguese rules of private international law, Portuguese law should have been applied). It should be mentioned that confirmation may also be challenged (i) if there is another final judgment which proves that the judgment under analysis arises from a crime committed by the judge in the exercise of his functions, (ii) if a document is presented whose existence a party was unaware of or if such party could not use such document during the proceedings in which judgment under analysis was rendered, provided that such document alone is deemed sufficient to modify the decision in favor of the defeated party or (iii) if the judgment is based on a sham litigation and the court has not prevented the parties from reaching their goal due to the fact that the court was unaware of the fraud.

The directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. 386 ----- The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not be recognized or enforceable in France ipso jure. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate recognition proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. Judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res _judicata effect (autorité de la chose jugée) as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus_ be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. The discovery process could also be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No 2018 670 of July 30, 2018 having transposed into French law Directive (EU) No. 2016/943 of June 8, 2016 (relating to the protection of certain business information). Similarly, French data protection rules (which mainly appear in law No. 78 17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to 387 ----- Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts, and thus refused to recognize foreign judgments that had exercised jurisdiction over French nationals. However, according to more recent case law, French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,854,ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS,854.6,Denmark,854.6.1,,"The United States and Denmark do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgement rendered by a U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in Denmark. A final judgement properly obtained in a U.S. federal or state court would therefore not be recognized nor enforced by the Danish courts without re-examination of the substantive matters thereby adjudicated. In connection with any such re-examination, such judgement would generally be accepted as material evidence, but the parties must provide the Danish courts with satisfactory information about the contents of the relevant foreign law and, if they fail to do so, the Danish courts may apply Danish law instead. Further, certain remedies available under U.S. federal or state law may not be allowed in Danish courts, i.e. if they are contrary to Danish public policy, including, among other, punitive damages. The Danish courts may award damages only to the extent necessary to compensate for actual economic losses. Similarly, procedural remedies, including specific rules on the taking of evidence such as the rules on “discovery” in the U.S., may not be available in legal proceedings before Danish courts. Similarly to the above, there can be no certainty that the Danish courts will enforce court judgements or orders obtained in the United States against any of the directors, officers, or other executives of a Danish guarantor, or that Danish courts will otherwise entertain actions in other jurisdictions. Foreign arbitral awards against a Danish guarantor (or against any of its directors, officers, or other executives) may be enforced in Denmark under the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and the 2005 Danish Arbitration Act.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
281_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,854,ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS,854.7,Switzerland,854.7.1,,"Judgments in civil or commercial matters of a non-Swiss court or authority will be recognized and enforced against an individual or a legal entity with legal domicile or seat in Switzerland pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral treaty or convention between the foreign country and Switzerland. Where no applicable treaty or convention exists, the rules of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (“PILA”) apply. In cases where a foreign judgment for a monetary claim shall be enforced, the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure (“ZPO”), apply in addition to the PILA. The judgment of a Swiss court or authority of first instance concerning recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment, including a U.S. Judgment, is generally subject to appeal. 388 ----- There is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in Switzerland and the applicability of U.S. federal or state laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a foreign court may be recognized under the PILA and enforced upon request by filing an application with the competent court in Switzerland only if certain requirements of the PILA are met, in particular: - the foreign court had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss law perspective. Jurisdiction or authority is established: - if a provision of PILA so provides or, in the absence of such provision, if the defendant had his legal domicile in the country in which the judgment was rendered; or - if the parties, in a pecuniary dispute, entered into an agreement valid under the PILA submitting their dispute to the jurisdiction of the court or authority which rendered the judgment; or - if the defendant, in a pecuniary dispute, proceeded on the merits without objecting to jurisdiction; or - if, in the event of a counterclaim, the court or authority which rendered the judgment had jurisdiction over the principal claim and if there is a factual connection between the principal claim and the counterclaim; - the judgment of such foreign court has become final and non-appealable under applicable foreign law, and no ordinary legal remedy is available against such judgment; - the recognition of the foreign judgment is not manifestly incompatible with Swiss public policy; - the defendant has been properly served with process according to the law of the state of his/ her/its domicile or ordinary residence (if in Switzerland, through judicial aid granted by the Swiss authorities) or the defendant has unconditionally appeared in the proceedings; - the proceedings leading to the judgment have respected the principles of a fair trial (as understood in Switzerland) and, in particular, that the defendant has been granted the right to be heard and the possibility to properly defend his/her/its case; and - no action between the same parties and on the same subject matter has been commenced or decided upon first in Switzerland and no judgment between the same parties and on the same subject matter has first been rendered by a foreign court, which judgment may be recognized in Switzerland. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce in Switzerland judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from foreign courts; however, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Awards of punitive damages in original actions outside Switzerland may also not be enforceable in Switzerland as they might be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a foreign court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damage. It is doubtful whether a Swiss court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings commenced in Switzerland predicated solely upon United States federal or state securities laws. In addition, in an action brought in a Swiss court on the basis of United States federal or state securities laws, the Swiss courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Any amount denominated in a foreign currency adjudicated in a final judgment which has to be enforced through Swiss debt collection authorities (schweizerische Zwangsvollstreckungsbehörden) has to be converted into Swiss francs. Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings, may prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery process exists (but the parties have very limited rights of precautionary taking of evidence in particular if one party shows credibly that the evidence is at risk or that it has a legitimate interest). Instead, before Swiss courts, the parties present the evidence in their possession during the proceedings and may request the production of documents in the counterparty’s possession in the course of the proceedings. 389 ----- Finally, no statement can be made as to the time and efficiency of the recognition and enforcement in Switzerland of a foreign judgment considering that recognition and enforcement proceedings tend to be time-consuming in Switzerland. Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad, amongst others, the United States of America to a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s reservations to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra-Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters concluded on 15 November 1965) and service needs to be effected by way of judicial assistance. 390 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

When testing for impairment of goodwill and other assets, the carrying amount should be compared with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. Impairment testing is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flow derived from such assets using cash flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. Since there are normally no quoted prices available to estimate the fair value less costs to sell an asset, the asset’s valuein-use is usually the value against which the carrying amount is compared for impairment testing purposes and is measured on the basis of assumptions and estimates. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flow, certain assumptions are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including management’s expectations of: - long-term sales growth rates - growth in adjusted EBITDA - timing and quantum of future capital expenditures - change in working capital - the selection of discount rates to reflect the risks involved. F-7 ----- The Group prepares and approves formal long-term management plans for operations, which are used in value-in-use calculations. For the purposes of the calculation, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as: - an assumed 3% growth rate for the mature markets - a projected long-term compound annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA in 5-10 years, estimated by management for developing countries. Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projections, could significantly affect our impairment evaluation and hence results. The yearly impairment test of goodwill is performed on the closing of the second quarter each year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain tax positions, the resolution for which is uncertain until an agreement has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process. The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profits, losses and/or cash flows. The complexity of our structure following our geographic expansion makes the degree of estimation and judgment more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the company and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the consolidated income statement and tax payments. We also have exercised significant accounting judgment regarding net operating loss utilisation. The Group also has exercised significant accounting judgment regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets. The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future against which the reversal of deductible temporary differences can be realised. Where the temporary differences related to losses, the availability of the losses to offset against forecast taxable profits is also considered. Recognition therefore involves judgment regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax assets have been recognised. The amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements in respect of each matter are derived from the company’s best estimation and judgment as described above. However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means eventual resolution could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the company’s results and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598

Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the financial settlement.

The incremental borrowing rate depends on a number of factors including length of lease period and asset type and are specific for each country. Extension options and end options. When the entity has the option to extend a lease, or end the lease before the contract end date, management uses its judgement to determine whether or not an option would be reasonably certain to be exercised. Management considers all facts and circumstances including their past practice and any cost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help them determine the lease term. The extension period has only been included in the present value calculation of future lease payments if it is deemed reasonably certain that the contract will be extended, and if it is deemed reasonably certain that an end option will be exercised this period have been excluded from the calculation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,598
