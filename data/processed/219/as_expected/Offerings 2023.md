Regulation S provided that an investor in a Member State of the EEA must not be a retail investor (as defined below) and an

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into whose
possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of jurisdiction in which you are

e-mail is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that it is free from viruses and other items
of a destructive nature.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any
place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed
broker or dealer and the Initial Purchaser (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchaser is a
licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchaser or such affiliate
on behalf of the Issuer (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering
Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in
any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be_
offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available
to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For the purposes of this provision, the expression retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to time, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended from time to time, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing
the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling
or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in any Member
State of the EEA (“Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending
to make an offer in a Member State of securities which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering
Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser to publish a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the
Initial Purchaser have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in which an
obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus for such offer.

_MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product_
approval process of Goldman Sachs International (the “Manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the debt
securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt
securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the
Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be_
offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available
to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For the purposes of this provision, a retail investor means a person who
is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information
document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK
or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation or the United Kingdom.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
“UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the UK of securities which are the subject of the offering
contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the


-----

Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such
offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities
in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus for such offer.

_UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product_
approval process of the Initial Purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (the “UK Manufacturer”), the
target market assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined
in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into
consideration the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product
Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the securities (by either adopting
or refining the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for distribution only
to persons (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being investment professionals falling within
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial
Promotion Order”)), (ii) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”)
of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) who are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) to whom an invitation or inducement to
engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection
with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such
persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and
must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the
Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. No part
of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to
any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
does not apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this
medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the Initial Purchaser,
any person who controls the Initial Purchaser, the Issuer, the Guarantors (each term, as defined in the Offering Memorandum),
any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or affiliates of any of the foregoing entities or persons, accepts
any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in
electronic form and any version that will be provided to you at a later date on request from the Initial Purchaser.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**


**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JULY 10, 2023**

**NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO U.S. PERSONS**


**CHF  100,000,000     % Senior Secured Notes due 2028**
**issued by Matterhorn Telecom S.A.**

Matterhorn Telecom S.A., a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the “Issuer”), is offering CHF 100,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of its     % Senior Secured Notes due     , 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated the Issue Date (as defined below) (the
“Indenture”).

The Notes will mature on       , 2028. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on each        and      , commencing on     , 2024. Prior
to      , 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “make-whole” premium. At any time on or after     , 2025 the Issuer
may redeem all or part of the Notes by paying a specified redemption price. In addition, prior to      , 2025, the Issuer may redeem at its option no more than 40% of the Notes
with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price specified herein, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
remains outstanding after the redemption. Additionally, upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control triggering event or upon certain asset sales, the Issuer may be
required to make an offer to purchase the Notes. A change of control triggering event, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is
not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes. In addition,
in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis, subject to certain limitations, by Matterhorn Telecom Holding
S.A. (the “Parent Guarantor”) and Salt Mobile SA (the “Company” or “Salt”) (together, the “Guarantors”). The guarantee by each Guarantor (each a “Guarantee” and, collectively,
the “Guarantees”) of the Notes, as applicable, will be (i) senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor; (ii) effectively senior in right of
payment to any existing or future obligations of the relevant Guarantor that is unsecured or secured on a basis junior to the Notes as defined herein, to the extent of the value of the
collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes; and (iii) effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Guarantor’s Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness.

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking liens granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the same assets that secure the Existing Euro 2027 Senior
Secured Notes (as defined herein), the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein), the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein) and the
Existing Senior Facilities (as defined herein), subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein).
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging obligations will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the security in priority to holders of
the Notes. See “The Offering—Security.”


The Notes will be represented by a global note in bearer form, which will be deposited with SIX SIS AG (“SIX SIS”) on or about July   , 2023 (the “Issue Date”).

There is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The SIX Exchange Regulation (the “Authority”) for the provisional admission to trading and the listing of the
Notes on the market for straight bonds of the SIX Swiss Exchange (the “Exchange”) and permission to deal in the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on
the Exchange or that such permission to deal in the Notes on the Exchange will be granted. This offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) may not be reproduced or
used for any other purpose, or be furnished to any other person other than those to whom copies have been sent.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction.
The Notes and the Guarantees are only being offered outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions by the Initial Purchaser (as defined herein) in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”), and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from,

Offering Memorandum is personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally
to subscribe for or otherwise acquire Notes. Distribution of this Offering Memorandum to any person other than the prospective
investor and any person retained to advise such prospective investor with respect to the purchase of Notes is unauthorized, and
any disclosure of any of the contents of this Offering Memorandum, without our prior written consent, is prohibited. Each

The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer has made all
reasonable inquiries and confirmed to the best of its knowledge, information and belief that the information contained in this
Offering Memorandum with regard to itself and its affiliates and the Notes is true and accurate in all material respects, that the
opinions and intentions expressed in this Offering Memorandum are honestly held, and the Issuer is not aware of any facts the
omission of which would make this Offering Memorandum or any statement contained herein misleading in any material
respect. The Issuer accepts responsibility accordingly.

including the section entitled “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” is subject to change in or reinterpretation of the rules,

Issuer, the Company and the other Guarantor have furnished the information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

Application will be made to the Authority for the provisional admission to trading and the listing of the Notes on the Exchange
and permission to deal in the Notes. In connection with such listing application, we contemplate to submit this Offering
Memorandum to the competent authority to be used as the base for such listing particulars. Although the listing particulars are
likely to contain substantially the same information as that contained in this Offering Memorandum, it is possible that we may
be required (under applicable law, rules, regulations or guidance applicable to the listing of securities or otherwise) to make
certain changes or additions to the financial and other information included in this Offering Memorandum and, in particular,
we may be required to include additional information, including additional financial information, in respect of the Guarantors.
We also may be required to update the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in our business, financial
condition or results or operations and prospects. Following the approval of the listing prospectus, the relevant listing particulars
will be available in electronic form on the website of the competent prospectus review body. Any investor or potential investor
should not base any investment decision relating to the Notes on the information contained in this Offering Memorandum after
publication of the listing particulars and should refer instead to those listing particulars.

We cannot guarantee that the application to the Authority for the Notes to be listed and the permission to deal in the Notes
thereof will be granted as of the Issue Date for the Notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining this admission to trading.

Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors.” The price of securities and the income from them can go down as
well as up.

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (THE “STABILIZING
MANAGER”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) MAY OVER-ALLOT NOTES

UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION. SUCH STABILIZING, IF COMMENCED, MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT
ANY TIME AND, IF BEGUN, MUST BE BROUGHT TO AN END AFTER A LIMITED PERIOD. ANY STABILIZATION
ACTION OR OVER-ALLOTMENT MUST BE CONDUCTED BY THE STABILIZING MANAGER (OR PERSONS
ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND

any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended from time to time, “MiFID II”) or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to time, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended from time to time, the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPS Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering
Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA will be deemed to have
represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor. The Issuer, the Initial Purchaser and their affiliates and
others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement.

_MiFID II Product Governance / professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market: Solely for the purposes_
of the product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for the Notes is “eligible counterparties” and “professional clients” only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturer’s
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

The Luxembourg financial sector supervisory commission (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) has not

intended for, and may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose.

**NOTICE TO UNITED KINGDOM INVESTORS**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is being distributed
only to and is directed only at: (i) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments and are
“investment professionals” as defined within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Order”), (ii) high net worth bodies corporate and any other person falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, (iii) persons outside the United Kingdom and (iv) persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or
investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in
only with relevant persons. Recipients of this Offering Memorandum are not permitted to transmit it to any other person. The
Notes are not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or
rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: (i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will
only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which
Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and (ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions
of the FSMA in respect of anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving, the United Kingdom.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes referred to herein in the United Kingdom
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to herein.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the United Kingdom of Notes which are the subject of the
offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the
Issuer or the Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in
relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any
offer of Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus for
such offer.

The Notes described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available
to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

_UK MiFIR Product Governance / professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market: Solely for the purposes_
of the product approval process of any relevant Initial Purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (a “UK
Manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “UK distributor”)
should take into consideration the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK
MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH YOU SHOULD READ

Guarantor” refers to Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A., a société anonyme organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of

**Financial and Other Data**

This Offering Memorandum includes the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”), as well as the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (the “Unaudited
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”).

The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standards 34 (“IAS 34”) “Interim Financial Reporting,” the standard of IFRS applicable to the preparation of
interim financial statements. The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have not been audited or
reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Société coopérative, nor have any procedures been performed by them with respect
thereto.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and
2022 and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 have been derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group, respectively.

Total current assets and total non-current assets as of December 31, 2021 have been extracted from the unaudited comparative
column of the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 as the presentation of
the current prepaid expenses as of December 31, 2021 in the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2021 had been overstated by CHF 9.5 million and the non-current prepaid expenses had been understated
by the same amount, therefore, the classification of the prepaid expenses as of December 31, 2021 between current and noncurrent in the unaudited comparative column of the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 has been re-presented accordingly, for comparability purposes.

Total current liabilities and total non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 have been extracted from the unaudited
comparative column of the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 as the
presentation of the current lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 in the audited consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2020 had been overstated by CHF 8.5 million and the non-current lease liabilities had been
understated by the same amount, therefore, the classification of the lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 between current
and non-current in the unaudited comparative column of the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2021 has been re-presented accordingly, for comparability purposes.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes unaudited consolidated as adjusted unaudited consolidated financial data,
which have been adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Refinancing (as defined below) on the cash interest expense of the
Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and the effects of the Refinancing on the financial position of the Group
as of March 31, 2023. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 has been calculated
by adding our unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and our
audited consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022, and subtracting our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

The financial data presented herein are presented in Swiss francs.

**Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures, including, among others, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDAaL (excluding impact of IFRS 16), capital expenditure, cash
capital expenditure, cash conversion, free cash flow and capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue that are not required
by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:

#### • “Adjusted EBITDA” refers to EBITDA, after excluding corporate and monitoring fees and restructuring,
transition and transaction costs.


-----

#### • “Adjusted EBITDA margin” refers to Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

 • “Adjusted EBITDAaL (excluding impact of IFRS 16)” refers to Adjusted EBITDA, excluding IFRS 16
impact.

#### • “capital expenditure” is defined as additions or advances in property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets during the period.

#### • “capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue” refers to capital expenditure divided by revenue.

 • “cash capital expenditure” refers to capital expenditure less the net increase/(decrease) in amounts due to
fixed assets suppliers excluding spectrum license payments and Towers Sale.

#### • “cash conversion” refers to EBITDA less cash capital expenditure, divided by EBITDA.

 • “EBITDA” refers to profit attributable to owners before income tax expenses/(benefit), share of net profit
(loss) of associates accounted for using the equity method, finance income, finance costs, depreciation of
right-of-use assets, depreciation and amortization and gain on disposal and other gains.

#### • “EBITDA margin” refers to EBITDA divided by revenue.

 • “EBITDAaL” refers to EBITDA, excluding IFRS 16 impact.

 • “free cash flow” refers to EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) (i) plus change in other provisions, (ii)
plus gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, (iii) plus change in working capital (defined as
decrease/(increase) in inventories, decrease/(increase) in trade receivables, increase/(decrease) in trade
payables and decrease/(increase) in other receivables and payables excluding any impact related to the IFRS
16 on working capital), (iv) plus decrease/(increase) in deposits, (v) plus income tax paid and (vi) plus net
cash generated/(used) from investing activities excluding spectrum license payments, proceeds from sale of
a subsidiary, net of cash disposed, proceeds from sale of an associate and interest income received.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented here differ from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” contained herein
under “Description of the Notes” and in the Indenture.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors,
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures
and ratios such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDAaL (excluding
impact of IFRS 16), capital expenditure, cash capital expenditure, cash conversion, free cash flow and capital expenditure as a
percentage of revenue are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. Neither the assumptions underlying the non-IFRS measures have been audited in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (“ISA”) or any other auditing standards. In evaluating the non-IFRS measures, investors
should carefully consider the financial statements of the Group included in this Offering Memorandum. Although certain of
this data has been extracted or derived from the financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum, this data has not
been audited or reviewed by the independent auditors. Other companies in our industry may calculate these non-IFRS measures
differently and, consequently, our presentation may not be readily comparable to other companies’ figures. In particular, you
should not consider these non-IFRS measures as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in
accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows provided by operating, investing and
financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under generally
accepted accounting principles. These non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider
it in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or thousands,
certain operating data, percentages describing market shares and penetration rates, have been subject to rounding adjustments
and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information.


-----

**Market, Economic and Subscriber Data; Market Share Data**

**_General_**

The subscriber data included in this Offering Memorandum, including average mobile revenue per user (“ARPU”), subscriber
numbers, our market share and churn rates are derived from management estimates, are not part of our financial statements or
financial accounting records and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside or independent auditors, consultants
or experts. Our use or computation of the terms ARPU or churn may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly
titled measures reported by other companies in the telecommunications industry. ARPU is a non-IFRS measure and should not
be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of our performance under IFRS. We believe that ARPU provides useful
information concerning the appeal and usage patterns of our tariff plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting
and retaining high-value subscribers of mobile voice, data and broadband services.

**_Subscribers_**

Postpaid mobile subscribers are counted in our subscriber base as long as they have an active contract, for both handset and
mobile broadband services, but exclude machine-to-machine subscriptions.

Broadband subscribers are counted in our subscriber base as long as they have an active contract.

Prepaid mobile subscribers are subscribers if their SIM card is connected to our network and they have had at least one
chargeable or recharge event or have received at least one incoming traffic event (excluding, among other things, traffic initiated
by us) within the last 435 days.

Generally, each connection counts as one subscriber; however, this may vary depending on the circumstances and subscriber
numbers should not be equated with the actual number of individuals or businesses using our services.

**_Churn_**

“Churn” refers to the percentage of subscriber disconnections. We deem mobile subscribers to have churned when their mobile
service with us is disconnected (whether resulting from a subscriber decision or our decision).

We calculate the churn rate by dividing the number of disconnections of postpaid subscribers during a period by the average
number of postpaid subscribers during the same period. The average number of subscribers does not include postpaid
subscribers without an active contract. Postpaid mobile subscribers are counted in our subscriber base as long as they have an
active contract, for both handset and mobile broadband services, but exclude machine-to-machine subscriptions.

Churn activity affects various key performance indicators, including total subscribers and ARPU levels. The definition of churn
may vary between operators. A churn policy that is more expansive in its determination of when a subscriber is deemed to have
churned may result in a reduction of the number reported for total subscribers, an increase in churn rate and potentially higher
ARPU. As a result, such data and any related comparisons of us to other operators included in this Offering Memorandum may
not accurately reflect our competitive position and the competitive positions of such other operators.

to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof
on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of purchase. A change of control will not be deemed
to have occurred on one occasion if the acquiror operates a
permitted business and a certain consolidated leverage ratio
is not exceeded as a result of such event that constitutes a
Specified Change of Control Event (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified
_Change of Control Event).” See “Description of the Notes—_
_Change of Control.”_

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the_
_following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only_
_ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are_
_immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the_
_possible events described below were to occur, the business, financial condition and results of operations of the_
_Group could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the Issuer may not be able to pay interest or_
_principal on the Notes when due, and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business**

**_Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions._**

Demand for our products and services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic
conditions in the global economy which may have a material adverse effect on the economic developments in
Switzerland. A global economic downturn that impacts Switzerland may adversely affect our services, as fewer
clients may have the ability to subscribe to our services. In the past year, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in
February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact
on global economic conditions, which has led to increased inflationary pressure in 2022 and the first half of 2023,
including causing increases in the price for goods and services, which has resulted and may continue to result in
shortages in materials and services. Such shortages have resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost
increases for labor, fuel, materials and services, and could continue to cause costs to increase in the near term.
Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and currently the conflict has not had
any material impact on our overall sales and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential
impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have on our operations. Moreover, supply
shortages in gas and other raw materials are significantly impacting many industries and sectors, which could
result in increases to the overall price of goods and services, and may, in turn, impact our results of operations as
our customers may seek to scale back on their expenditures.

Continuing high inflation could impact the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are
able to realize on our services, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Inflation has also resulted in a rise of interest rates to the highest levels seen in years and
central banks around the world may keep rising interest rates further or keeping them at the current high levels,
which in turn would result in higher interests we incur on our borrowings. There remains considerable uncertainty
over the long-term effects of the above factors and the monetary and fiscal policies which have been adopted by
the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies. We cannot predict the longterm effects such factors may have on the global political and economic conditions, including whether they may
result in a severe or prolonged global economic recession.

These unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of subscribers, and, as a result, it may,
among other things, be more (i) difficult for us to attract new subscribers, (ii) likely that subscribers will
downgrade or disconnect their services and (iii) difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Accordingly,
our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, operating cash flow, operating cash
flow margins and liquidity of our business could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains
uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.

We are also subject to increasing operating costs, mainly relating to network expansion, deployment and energy.
Although we generally attempt to reduce the impact of such costs by being more cost-efficient, there is no
assurance that we will be able to do so due to competitive and other factors. Operating costs may rise faster than
associated revenue or our costs-efficiency initiatives, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and
results of operations. We are also affected by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other
administrative costs which we may not be in a position to offset effectively, which in turn could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to effectively offset the
foregoing, we may need to increase our prices, which could increase our churn or impact our competitive position
in the market.

Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.


-----

**_Our results of operations depend on economic developments in Switzerland, our primary market._**

We operate primarily in the Swiss market and generate almost all of our revenue and operating income from our
activities in Switzerland. Demand for our products and services in Switzerland is influenced by a number of
factors, including the strength of the Swiss economy. Negative developments in, or the general weakness of, the
Swiss economy may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of our customers and the willingness
of business customers to make investments. A higher number of defaults by customers or business partners, for
example due to an increase in unemployment rates could have a negative impact on our results of operations and
jeopardize our growth targets. Events impacting travel to or from Switzerland such as changes in the Swiss
economy, changes in the relative value of the Swiss franc, or general travel disruptions could negatively impact
our revenue from roaming fees. In addition, a weakening economy or recessionary conditions may weigh on the
growth prospects in the Swiss mobile telecommunications market in terms of the penetration of new value-added
services and traffic, ARPU levels and number of subscriptions and, in particular, the volume of business
customers. Economic effects outside of Switzerland may also impact our business, particularly our revenue from
international interconnection costs and visitor roaming costs. Any weakening of the Swiss economy and the
resulting risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_The Swiss telecommunications market is characterized by strong competition among existing and potential_**
**_new mobile and fixed network operators._**

We face strong competition from established competitors in Switzerland, including in particular Swisscom and
Sunrise. Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications provider, has significantly larger market share and
investment capacity than us and benefits from considerable financing, marketing and personnel resources, brandname recognition, perceived network quality and customer service, as well as majority Swiss government
ownership and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities.

Sunrise, our other key competitor which further increased its market share through its merger with UPC Suisse in
2021, also has a larger market share than us. We may also face increased competition in the Swiss mobile and
fixed line telecommunications market as a result of other consolidations of, or the cooperation between, our
competitors. In addition, our competitors may enter into network sharing agreements that increase their network
capabilities and significantly reduce their investment requirements and operating costs which could lead to price
pressure and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From
time to time, we may also enter into IRU contracts for fiber activities with our competitors, such as the Swisscom
Agreement. While any agreement would be entered into based on the expectation of a commercial benefit, there
is a risk that such agreement could reduce our capability to deploy our prospective network plans, which in turn
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our competitors have at times lowered roaming prices and pursued other aggressive pricing and marketing
strategies to retain and expand their market share both with regard to mobile subscribers and contracts with mobile
virtual network operators (“MVNOs”) and resellers. Any of these pricing or marketing strategies could reduce
our margins, dilute our earnings and cause our customers to switch to Swisscom or Sunrise. Our subscriber
acquisition and retention costs may increase for new subscribers and/or churning subscribers as a result of
significant competition in the mobile telecommunications markets in which we operate, which could put further
pressure on our earnings.

In addition, due to its dominant position and financial capacity, Swisscom has the ability to establish new market
standards in Switzerland by quickly introducing new and advanced technologies, which would require us to
accelerate our mobile and fixed network enhancements and our mobile and fixed service offerings. If this
happened, we might need to adapt our network and service offerings, which could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We also face high levels of competition from resellers and MVNOs._**

Resellers and MVNOs have been increasing their share of the Swiss mobile market in past years, following an
international trend towards increasing diversification in the telecommunications markets. This has increased
competition and pricing pressure in our markets, principally in the prepaid market but also increasingly in the
postpaid market. Like all Swiss MNOs, we have arrangements with resellers. To MNOs, such arrangements
generally provide less revenue and lower margins than other services. As a result, a potential increase in market
share of resellers and MVNOs may reduce our margins and revenue if we fail to increase our own market share.
Aggressive pricing from resellers or MVNOs on our network or on other networks and pressure from resellers
and MVNOs on our network for contract terms that are more favorable to them could also increase the competitive


-----

pressure and cause our results of operations to decline. If we are unable to compete effectively with resellers and
MVNOs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**_We face increasing competition from alternative telecommunications services._**

We are facing increasing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile
voice over the Internet technologies, in particular over the top (“OTT”) applications, such as, Facebook
Messenger, Facetime, Google Talk, Skype, Snapchat, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often
free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging
and voice services over the Internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services
(SMS/MMS) provided by MNOs like us, who are only able to charge the Internet data usage for such services.
With the growing share of smartphone users in the Swiss mobile subscriber base, there are an increasing number
of customers using OTT services. All MNOs and MVNOs are currently competing with OTT service providers
who leverage existing infrastructures and are often not required to implement capital-intensive business models
associated with traditional MNOs like us. OTT service providers have in recent years become more sophisticated,
and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in
speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple Inc.
(“Apple”), Google Inc., Facebook and Microsoft Corporation have turned their attention to the provision of OTT
services. In the long term, if non-traditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase
in popularity and if we, or more generally all the MNOs, are not able to address this competition, this could cause
declines in ARPU, subscriber base and profitability across all of our products and services, among other material
adverse effects.

In addition, we may face increasing competition from a large-scale rollout of public Wi-Fi networks by local
governments and utilities, transportation service providers, new and existing Wi-Fi telecommunications operators
and others, which particularly benefits OTT applications. Sunrise is increasingly rolling out a nationwide public
Wi-Fi network powered by the Horizon customer “homespots.” The national railway company SBB provides free
public Wi-Fi at major railway stations across Switzerland. In addition, certain transportation companies offer
commuters free internet access in trains, trams and busses through Wi-Fi operators standard data connection. Due
to the ability to leverage their existing infrastructure and thus to roll out public Wi-Fi in a cost-efficient way, other
competitors in addition to Sunrise and, in particular, Swisscom are better positioned to offer their customers public
Wi-Fi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which
may affect our ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, our competitors may realize cost savings by
off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own Wi-Fi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs
and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than we can. An increase in public Wi-Fi networks could also
cause declines in ARPU and profitability as demand for our network and services decreases.

We, and other mobile and fixed network operators, may also face growing competition from satellite internet
providers. We expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit
satellite companies as well as in the area of fixed wireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional
landline internet service providers. The launch of new satellite providers and the growth of the satellite internet
market may present significant competition to network operations such as ourselves.

If we are unable to compete effectively with alternative telecommunications services, our business, financial
condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**_Our future growth depends on customer preferences and market acceptance of innovative products._**

Since our entry into the fixed telecommunications market in 2018, we offer integrated products over our fixed
line and/or cable networks, including fixed-mobile services bundles comprising mobile, fixed voice and
broadband internet products, as well as “quadruple-play” offerings that combine these three products with
television services. Bundled services are expected to become increasingly important and customers that have such
services are less likely to switch to a different operator for all or part of the bundled services. If demand for
“quadruple-play” products does not increase as expected, this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Our future revenue growth depends in part on market acceptance of
new product introductions and product innovations. We may not be able to implement our growth strategy
efficiently, attract enough customers or we could face unforeseen issues or difficulties with the FTTH networks,
including Swisscom, and/or our relationship with those that grant us the right of use of their FTTH networks,
amongst other things. In addition, our partners, including Swisscom, may face regulatory and other risks that could
impair or delay our growth strategy as currently envisaged.

If any one or more of these events were to occur or if our offering does not develop according to plans, we may
be unable to successfully compete in the fixed line and Internet market and in turn be unable to leverage off that


-----

offering by also offering integrated products and consequently harm our competitiveness, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Furthermore, in the event
of a substantial reduction of fiber customers, we would still be contractually obligated to pay for an infrastructure
designed for a higher number of customers, which could result in a material negative impact on our cash flow and
results of operations.

In addition, although we believe there are significant barriers to entry, if any potential new fixed line competitor
were to successfully enter the Swiss telecommunications market and gain significant market share, it could
exacerbate the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs. More significantly, although we believe there are
significant barriers to entry, if a new mobile network operator (“MNO”) successfully entered the Swiss mobile
market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A
new, or existing, MNO could sign an agreement with one of the other two major network operators in Switzerland
(Swisscom and Sunrise) and/or with existing network infrastructure service providers or develop and operate a
network infrastructure in a specific geographical region and obtain coverage over the rest of Switzerland by
entering into roaming agreements. A new MNO could also successfully enter the mobile market as a result of the
allocation of the new spectrum or in the event the existing spectrum becomes available (see below for a description
of the spectrum allocation in Switzerland). If the existing spectrum becomes available for a new allocation and
frequency sharing is allowed, existing operators could consolidate or terminate a license prematurely. An entrant
could develop and operate a network infrastructure targeted at one or more geographical regions and subsequently
obtain coverage over the rest of Switzerland by entering into roaming agreements or litigating similar access based
on existing interconnection obligations. If any new MNO were to successfully enter the Swiss mobile market as
an additional competitor, or existing operators were to further combine or share their resources or infrastructure,
it could materially reduce our market share and could overall have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Embedded SIM technologies allowing multiple operators to offer their service at the same time could also enable
customers to instantly switch from one MNO to the other, which would increase the risk of churn and thus
competition to retain customers. If we are unable to compete effectively with new and existing MNOs, our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

As a consequence of the above factors, in order to remain competitive, we could be forced to reduce prices and/or
improve our service offerings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our ability to execute our strategies depends on a number of significant factors, some of which are beyond our_**
**_control._**

Our success depends on our ability to effectively identify, develop and execute our strategies, including growing
our B2B Mobile, B2C Mobile and Home segments. Our ability to execute our strategies may take longer than
expected and may incur significant costs. Actual results may be materially different than those planned. Our ability
to execute our strategies depends on a number of significant factors, some of which are beyond our control,
including our ability to respond to competitive pressures in our industry or the due performance by our partners
and providers of their services to us. Our Home offer, for example, requires (i) maintaining the necessary
authorizations (occupancy of public property, right of entry into buildings and obtaining the right to use our
partners’ networks, among others), (ii) performance of work entrusted to third-party service providers, (iii)
delivery of high service levels and coverage to an increasing subscriber base and (iv) managing costs associated
with our broadband strategy, among other factors. Failure to execute these initiatives and strategies could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are successful in
pursuing our Home strategy, we will be exposed to risks relating to (i) the significant expenses associated with
the operation, administration, maintenance and repair of the network we use to provide our services (including
the payment of unused IRU lines or feeders), (ii) the substantial resources required for the expansion or adaptation
of our network, (iii) the risk of disruptions in our services and resulting damage to our reputation among
consumers, (iv) our ability to renew our rights of way or our ability to renew them on non-onerous terms and (v)
decreases in the market prices for our products and services, among others.

**_If we fail to maintain or further develop our direct and indirect distribution and customer care channels, our_**
**_ability to sustain and further grow our subscriber base could be materially and adversely affected._**

We depend on our internal channels and third parties to market, sell and provide a significant portion of our
products and services. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, we distribute our products and services in
Switzerland directly through our network of 107 Salt.-branded shops and through online sales and telesales, as
well as indirectly through more than 800 points of sale of our partners’ distribution channels, including through
wholesale resellers, such as Swiss Post, Mobilezone, Lidl and smaller local retailers.


-----

We intend to continue to develop our direct distribution channel, by, among other things, opening additional
shops, which will require significant capital expenditure. We may not be able to recoup such costs or increase our
revenue by expanding our distribution presence. In particular, if we are not able to renew or replace our current
shop leases or enter into new leases for shops on favorable terms, or any of our current leases are terminated prior
to their stated expiry date, and we cannot find suitable alternate locations, our growth and profitability could be
harmed.

Additionally, if we fail to expand our direct distribution presence, or if we fail to maintain our key distribution
relationships, or if our distribution partners fail to procure sufficient subscribers for any reason, our ability to
retain or further grow our market share in the markets we operate could be adversely affected. In addition, the
subscriber acquisition and retention costs associated with maintaining or further growing our subscriber base
through both direct channels and indirect channels could materially increase in the future. These factors in turn
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of our
distribution relationships are terminated, we may face claims from the respective counterparty for compensation
for clientele pursuant to Swiss law. If such claims were successful and the respective distributors were awarded a
compensation for clientele, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_The success of our mobile and Home operations depends on our ability to attract and retain mobile and Home_**
**_subscribers._**

Our ability to attract and retain mobile and Home subscribers and to increase our profitability from existing
subscribers will depend in large part on our ability to stimulate and increase subscriber usage, convince subscribers
to switch from competing mobile and fixed operators to our services and our ability to minimize subscriber
deactivation rates, referred to in the industry as customer “churn.” Our competitors may also improve their ability
to attract new subscribers, for example by offering bundled products and triple-play and quadruple-play offerings
or other products or services at lower prices, which would make it more difficult for us to retain our current
subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase.

Churn is a measure of subscribers who stop purchasing or using our services, leading to reduced revenue. Any
increase in customer churn may lead to a need to reduce our costs rapidly to preserve our margins or, alternatively,
take measures that will increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs. There can be no assurance that the
various measures we have taken and plan to take to manage churn and increase customer loyalty will reduce our
churn rate. The mobile telecommunications industry is characterized by frequent developments in product
offerings, as well as by advances in network and handset technology and competition in respect of pricing. If we
fail to maintain and upgrade our network or services and provide our subscribers with an attractive portfolio of
products and services at competitive pricing, we may not be able to retain subscribers. Likewise, if we fail to
effectively communicate the benefits of our network or services through our marketing and advertising efforts,
we may not be able to attract new customers. Furthermore, even if we are successful in attracting new customers,
there can be no assurance that customer revenue will increase accordingly or at all, as market price evolution is
not fully under our control. Additionally, a loss of commercial success could potentially lead to unutilized
purchased FTTH lines or our inability to serve volume commitments under the Swisscom Agreement. Any of the
above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Customer satisfaction levels that are lower than our competitors’ customer satisfaction levels could adversely_**
**_affect our ability to acquire new and maintain existing customers._**

The Swiss mobile telecommunications market is driven by, among other factors, customer satisfaction. Customer
satisfaction may be impacted by a variety of factors, including customers’ perception of the overall package, pricevalue ratio of services, range of offerings, network quality, coverage, functionality and speed, products and
services, invoice accuracy and operators’ ability to solve customer problems in a fast, efficient and customerfriendly way (customer service). We may not be able to maintain and improve customer satisfaction sufficiently
and may be ranked behind Swisscom and Sunrise in certain satisfaction studies, such as Connect, Bilanz-Rating
and K-Tipp, which may affect our ability to acquire new customers and increase our customer churn, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend on our key partners and other third parties for the provision of certain services. Our relationships_**
**_with certain suppliers of services and equipment are critical to conducting our business._**

Our relationships with certain suppliers of services and equipment are critical to conducting our business. We
depend on key supply partners such as Swisscom and Sunrise for interconnection, Swisscom, Swiss Fibre Net
AG, the City of Zürich (ewz), the City of Lausanne (LFO SA), SIG (Geneva) and iwb (Basel) for the use of their
FTTH networks, Teleperformance Portugal SA and Teleperformance Athens for the provision of call center


-----

services and Swiss Infra for the provision of hosting services and construction of new sites and works and
engineering services with respect to passive mobile infrastructure. In addition, we have relationships with a
number of key sourcing partners for mobile network equipment, network rollout, fixed access and software, fiber
routers, handsets and other retail equipment such as from Apple, Samsung, Huawei and Nokia.

Our reliance on Swisscom and Sunrise for interconnection exposes us to significant risks. For example, the prices
they charge alternative operators, including us, for wholesale services they provide have a direct impact on our
profitability. Furthermore, any potential failures or interruptions on their networks, or failures to fully comply
with the terms of contracts we have in place with them, could have an impact on our services and may create
interruptions or quality problems for our services and could have a material impact on our ability to retain and
attract customers. We are also dependent on third-party providers for the use of their FTTH networks, and the
expansion and success of our fixed line offering is therefore, in part, reliant on them and is exposed to similar
risks. We also rely on third-party operators for the provision of international roaming services for our mobile
subscribers. While we have interconnection and roaming agreements in place with other operators, we do not have
direct control over the quality of their networks and the interconnection and roaming services they provide.
Additionally, our counterparties may decide to charge additional fees for our use of their networks, such as
termination fees for SMS services. Even if we attempt to offset such fees by implementing similar fees ourselves,
we may not be able to offset the added costs. In certain cases, these agreements can be terminated by our
counterparties upon a reasonably short notice. Any difficulties or delays in interconnecting with other networks
and services, or the failure of any operator to provide reliable interconnections or roaming services to us on a
consistent basis, could result in a loss of subscribers or a decrease in traffic, which would reduce our revenue and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In 2019 and 2021, we entered into the Cellnex Contracts with Swiss Infra, certain of which provide for various
services in relation to hosting services and construction of new sites and ongoing works and engineering with
respect to passive mobile infrastructure. As we are reliant on that infrastructure for our mobile offerings, any
potential failures to comply with the terms of the Cellnex Contracts, including any failure regarding our
commitments to build sites to be sold under the build-to-suit program of the Cellnex MSA, or any material
disagreements, issues or disputes with Cellnex could have a material impact on our ability to run our mobile
business efficiently and effectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain
and attract customers and therefore also on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
in 2021, we entered into the Swisscom Agreement. Our agreement with Swisscom was amended in January 2023,
following Swisscom’s decision to shift its FTTH roll out from a Point-to-Multipoint (“P2MP”) topology to a
Point-to-Point (“P2P”) topology. As we rely on Swisscom’s infrastructure to render our broadband services, any
potential failures to comply with the terms of the partnership agreement with Swisscom, including, in particular,
any failure by Swisscom to comply with its building commitments under the Swisscom Agreement, or any
material disagreements, issues or disputes with Swisscom could have a material impact on our ability to use
Swisscom’s nationwide FTTH network or develop our footprint as planned and, therefore, materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We do not have direct operational or financial control over our service providers, suppliers and sourcing partners
and have limited influence with respect to the manner in which they conduct their businesses. Any failure of a
supplier, service provider or sourcing partner to perform its obligations under the contracts to the satisfaction of
our customers could impact our ability to retain and attract customers or offer attractive product offerings. Our
ability to maintain and grow our subscriber base depends in part on our ability to source adequate supplies of
network equipment, mobile handsets and software in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities from these
suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers and sourcing partners may expose us to risks related to interruptions,
delays in the delivery of their products and services or significant costs. Suppliers are at times subject to supply
constraints, particularly when there is high demand for a particular product, such as the iPhone or the Apple TV
box. We have, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited supplies due to capacity
constraints and other supply-related factors, as well as quality control problems with service providers. We may
also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages to which we may be
entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely manner. For additional
risks related to our supplier relationships, see “—We depend on an open, independent and non-discriminatory
_economic and political environment, allowing us to choose our partners freely and based on economic,_
_environmental and social aspects.”_

If we experience a significant disruption in our supply of equipment (in particular, fiber routers and Apple TV
boxes) and services from key sourcing and/or supplier partners and/or a significant change in the terms on which
we do business with them, or if the agreements described herein are not extended or are extended at less favorable
conditions, including the agreements with our roaming partners, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected.


-----

**_We depend on an open, independent and non-discriminatory economic and political environment, allowing us_**
**_to choose our partners freely and based on economic, environmental and social aspects._**

Our growth and success partly depend on our ability to choose our partners freely, taking into account our
strategies and business needs. Recent geopolitical tensions (in particular between the United States and China) on
cybersecurity matters may pose a threat to our free choice of partners. In particular, cybersecurity regulation
continues to be of paramount importance in the fixed-line and telecommunications infrastructure market around
the world, most notably in relation to the Chinese equipment provider Huawei. We rely on supply from China and
if our chain of supply from China is impacted by any economic or political measure, this will have a significant
impact on our supply of equipment and devices. For example, in July 2020, following advice from the National
Cyber Security Centre, the UK Government announced new controls on the use of Huawei 5G equipment,
including a ban on the purchase of new Huawei equipment from December 31, 2020 onwards, as well as a
commitment to remove all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by 2027. In Switzerland, a motion requesting
the protection of critical infrastructure from the influence of other states has recently passed in the National
Council and will be presented to the Council of States. Any regulation restricting our ability to freely choose a
business partner or that may restrict us to use certain technology or infrastructure, in particular with respect to our
recent business arrangements with Huawei as one of our principal network suppliers and SpaceX, could increase
our costs or affect our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We are dependent on roaming arrangements with other international telecommunications operators._**

We are dependent upon roaming agreements with other international telecommunications operators as a source of
revenue when other telecommunications operators’ customers roam on our networks and when our customers
roam on other international telecommunications operators’ networks. Revenues from international roaming
amounted to CHF 31.3 million, CHF 44.8 million, CHF 46.0 million and CHF 10.1 million in the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and in the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing 3.2%, 4.3%, 4.3%
and 3.7%, respectively, of our revenues for these periods.

If these roaming agreements were to terminate or should such agreements not be extended or extended at less
favorable conditions, or if the other international telecommunications operators were to deploy technologies that
are incompatible with our networks, our roaming revenues and profits may be materially reduced. In addition,
should any of our roaming partners choose to divert roaming traffic away from our network in favor of our
competitors’ networks, we may still be required to have our customers roam on our roaming partners’ international
networks, which would have a negative impact on our roaming revenues and EBITDA. Although we have not
experienced this issue in the past and we have no indication that our roaming partners intend to send more traffic
in Switzerland through other operators, there can be no assurance that this may not happen in the future. Any of
the above risks, if realized, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We depend on our wholesale resellers, MVNO and third-party partners to access a broader and more diverse_**
**_base of subscribers and grow our subscriber base and/or revenues._**

We compete with resellers and MVNOs, but we also depend on them to expand our reach to new customer
segments, in particular in more mass-market segments. We may, however, be unable to renew our existing
arrangements with resellers on commercially favorable terms, and resellers may also terminate their relationships
with us and discontinue their services on relatively short notice. We may not succeed in executing our partnership
with Swiss Post, pursuant to which, commencing in 2024, all mobile products distributed by Swiss Post would be
based on the Salt partnership, and the risk of losing this partnership in the years to come could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, MVNOs may start offering their services through our
competitor’s network. Moreover, resellers and MVNOs may not be able to add new subscribers or may lose
subscribers, which could also have a negative impact on our revenue and impact the expansion of our reach and/or
could be damaging to our reputation. Our inability to maintain or renew our existing partnerships with resellers
(such as Lidl and Swiss Post) or MVNOs or to attract new resellers or MVNOs or of resellers or MVNOs to attract
new subscribers or maintain their subscriber base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to maintain the benefits from our IT transformation initiatives and to fully complete_**
**_outstanding initiatives._**

We have completed the vast majority of our IT transformation initiatives, which, inter alia, have allowed us to
improve our customer relationship management, billing and rating and optimize our IT support costs. We have,
however, yet to implement some of these initiatives and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully


-----

maintain the benefits from the IT transformation initiatives already implemented or to complete any outstanding
initiatives, given that circumstances may change in the future and to some degree may be beyond our control. In
addition, further updates to our IT systems may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned,
which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to implement further updates to our IT systems in the timeframes we desire or at all.

**_Our inability to adequately predict customer demand for data, calls and roaming services could result in_**
**_increased costs and decreased profitability._**

Our inability to adequately predict customer demand for data, calls and roaming services could result in increased
costs and decreased profitability. Customer demand for each of our services may vary over time, and identifying
these changes is key to our success. Any substantial increase of customer demand for data traffic, in particular
broadband data traffic, calls and roaming services over forecast levels could result in increased additional costs of
making services available to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_The telecommunications industry has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by rapid_**
**_technological change, and we may not be able to effectively anticipate or react to these changes._**

The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and related changes in customer
demand for new products and services at competitive prices. Recently, the market has witnessed the emergence
of, or increased demand for, new technologies. Technological change and the emergence of alternative
technologies for the provision of telecommunications services that are technologically superior, cheaper or
otherwise more attractive than those that we provide may render our services less profitable, less viable or
obsolete.

Technological developments may also shorten product life cycles and facilitate convergence of various segments
in the telecommunications industry. Our competitors or potential new market entrants may introduce new or
technologically superior telecommunications services before we do. In particular, Swisscom, due to its strong
position and both financial and investment capacity, has the ability to create new market standards by quickly
introducing new advanced technologies, such as 5G technology, HSPA+ and 3GPP LTE mobile networks or
Voice-over-LTE, which is an advancement in voice-call technology utilizing the LTE network (which has
previously been used for data transfer only). We may be required to deploy new technologies rapidly if, for
example, subscribers begin demanding features of a new technology, such as increased bandwidth, or if one of
our competitors decides to emphasize a newer technology in its marketing. At the time, we select and advance
one technology over another, or decide on whether to emphasize a specific technology, it may not be possible to
accurately predict which technology may prove to be the most economical, efficient or capable of attracting
subscribers or stimulating usage, or how rapidly any competitor focuses on a particular new technology, and we
may develop or implement a technology that does not achieve widespread commercial success or that is not
compatible with other newly developed technologies.

In addition, we may not receive, or only receive at onerous conditions, the necessary licenses to provide services
based on these new technologies in the markets we operate in or may be negatively impacted by unfavorable
regulation regarding the usage of these technologies. For example, although we have entered in an agreement with
SpaceX to provide continuous coverage through satellite technology, which is the first of its kind in Europe, our
licence does not grant us the right to use any of our bandwidths to connect to SpaceX satellites, as approval is
required to launch and offer the service, and there can be no assurance that we will receive such approval. If we
are unable to effectively anticipate, react to or access technological changes in the telecommunications market or
to otherwise compete effectively, we could lose subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers or incur substantial
costs and investments in order to maintain our subscriber base, all of which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is capital intensive. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our capital_**
**_expenditure programs or our ongoing operations in the future._**

Our business is capital intensive and requires significant amounts of investments. We have an ongoing capital
expenditure program that will continue to require significant capital outlays in the foreseeable future, including
the continued renewal/swap of equipment at our access network sites, the expansion of our network coverage,
upgrading of existing sites and the expansion of fixed broadband. We may also need to make investments to
provide business continuity and to meet requirements for information security and disaster recovery, all of which
could require significant capital expenditure, which could be further increased by new regulation requiring
increased levels of the technical protection of telecommunications networks as proposed by the Swiss Federal
Council (Bundesrat) in its report of November 2014 and its press release of December 2020 and included in the


-----

revised Swiss Telecommunications Act, under which the Federal Council is entitled to enact certain regulations
in this respect. If network usage develops faster than we anticipate, we may require greater capital investments in
shorter timeframes than we anticipate, and we may not have the resources to make such investments. In addition,
costs associated with the licenses and spectrums that we need to operate our existing networks and technologies
and those that we may acquire and/or develop in the future, as well as costs and rental expenses related to their
deployment, could be significant. The amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially
from our current estimates due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may also be required
to raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any
future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We may
not accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms
of our existing indebtedness and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. In
addition, we may not generate sufficient cash flows in the future to meet our capital expenditure needs, sustain
our operations or meet our other capital requirements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Equipment and network systems failures could result in reduced user traffic and revenue, require_**
**_unanticipated capital expenditure or harm our reputation._**

Our technological infrastructure is vulnerable to damage and disruptions from numerous events, including fire,
flood, windstorms and other natural disasters or severe weather conditions, power outages, terrorist acts,
intentional damage, equipment and system failures, human errors, intentional wrongdoings, malicious acts and
other similar events, including breaches of our network and information technology security. Unanticipated
problems at our facilities, network or system failures or the occurrence of such unanticipated problems at the
facilities, network or systems of third-party local and long-distance networks on which we rely could result in
reduced user traffic and revenue, regulatory penalties and/or penal sanctions or require unanticipated capital
expenditure to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems or
to protect them from similar events in the future. In addition, we may not be able to timely bill for the services we
provide. Any such events could subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators in Switzerland
and could materially disrupt and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition or lead to
litigation and disaster recovery plans put in place and/or our insurance policies with respect to some or all of these
risks may not be sufficient to mitigate the potential losses and damages. The occurrence of network or system
failure could also harm our reputation or impair our ability to retain current subscribers or attract new subscribers,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, our business is dependent on certain sophisticated critical systems, including exchanges, switches and
other key network elements and our billing and customer service systems. The hardware supporting those systems
is housed in a relatively small number of locations and if damage were to occur to any of these locations, or if
those systems develop other problems, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental_**
**_requirements relating to mobile telecommunications transmission equipment and devices, including the_**
**_location of antennas._**

Various reports have alleged that there may be health risks associated with the effects of electromagnetic signals
from antenna sites, mobile handsets and other mobile and wireless telecommunications devices. We cannot assure
you that further medical research and studies will not establish a link between electromagnetic signals or radio
frequency emissions and these health concerns. The actual or perceived risk of mobile and wireless
telecommunications devices, press reports about risks or consumer litigation relating to such risks could adversely
affect the size or growth rate of our subscriber base and result in decreased mobile usage or increased litigation
costs. We are currently party to a number of pending proceedings in which plaintiffs are seeking prohibition of
antenna construction and/or compensation for damages caused by planned antenna construction based inter alia
on alleged exposure to electromagnetic radiation from our technology. In addition, these health concerns may
cause the Swiss authorities to impose stricter regulations on the construction of base stations or other
telecommunications network infrastructure. In particular, public concern over actual or perceived health effects
related to electromagnetic radiation may result in increased costs related to our networks, which may hinder the
completion or increase the cost of network deployment, reduce the coverage of our network and hinder the
commercial availability of new services. Current initiatives against 5G deployment, including constructing more
antenna with higher frequency emissions, among certain activist groups and the reaction of some politicians and
authorities on a cantonal and communal level may have a negative impact on our network and our customer base.
Actual or perceived health risks may result in decreased mobile usage, increased consumer litigation or stricter
regulation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.


-----

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use and the protection of the environment,
including those governing the storage, management and disposal of hazardous materials and the clean-up of
contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and third-party
claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and
regulations. In addition, we are involved in numerous pending administrative proceedings regarding antenna sites
and several respective private legal proceedings. A negative outcome of these proceedings could have a negative
impact on our ability to maintain existing or set up new antennas and thus a negative impact on the coverage of
our network. In extreme cases, the penalty for repeat violations of the applicable environmental laws in
Switzerland could result in administrative sanction, suspension and even revocation of our license. Furthermore,
a finding in the courts that we are liable for any loss or damage could have a negative impact on our future
operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Continuing uncertainties, moratoria and opposition of the public against, in particular, building permits and_**
**_the 5G rollout may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The rollout of the 5G mobile network has been criticized because of the alleged possibility of health risks and
faces widespread skepticism in the population in Switzerland. Several Cantons and municipalities have issued
moratoria and implemented stricter authorization practices for the construction of mobile phone antennas. In
addition, according to media articles relying on sources from the federal government and the telecommunications
industry, the authorities of various municipalities have stopped issuing building permits for 5G antennas. In May
2019, the Swiss Federal Office of Communications and the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment officially
stated that, pursuant to the division of competences between the Confederation and the Cantons, only the
Confederation may issue regulations on the protection of the population from harmful impacts or nuisances due
to noise from non-ionizing radiation. They also clarified that there is, therefore, no room for special cantonal or
communal provisions in addition to the applicable federal laws. The approval process for 5G antennas, however,
remains strict and lengthy. For example, as of June 30, 2023, 811 build permit applications relating to mobile
phone antennas remain pending, 66% of these applications relate to build permits upgrades and 33% to build
permits on new sites. As of June 30, 2023, 86 applications remain open legal cases.

If the rollout of the 5G mobile network continues to stall due to public skepticism and restrictive and slow approval
practices, we may incur increased costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
conditions and results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by our ability to maintain and increase our network coverage._**

The coverage of our network depends on our ability to maintain and/or upgrade existing and to build up new
antennas for our network. Our antennas are generally built on land owned by third parties, the use of which is
secured by way of lease agreements. There can be no guarantee that these lease agreements will be extended or
renegotiated on commercially favorable terms upon the expiration of their respective terms, or that they will be
extended at all. If we are not able to renew our current lease agreements for antenna sites and/or to enter into new
lease agreements for suitable alternate antenna sites, this could have a negative impact on the coverage of our
network. Additionally, some of the equipment used in our network is installed on customer premises. Disputes
with these customers or legal proceedings involving their property may subject this equipment to encumbrances
or cause it to be inaccessible, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our network. In addition, a
substantial part of our sites are managed according to the Cellnex Contracts and we do not have full control over
such sites. Furthermore, should site rental costs increase faster than anticipated, Cellnex may not be able to bear
such increases and may default on their obligations in Switzerland, which would have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.

Furthermore, certain regulatory approvals, such as new building permits, are required to operate antenna sites with
other frequencies/frequency bands, in particular where the shift is made from a higher frequency band (e.g., 1800
MHz) to a lower frequency band (e.g., 900 MHz) and new technologies such as 5G and adaptive antennas.
Although we have already received licenses to operate 5G antenna sites, to the extent that we seek to obtain any
new regulatory or administrative approvals, including building permits, to keep operating or updating antenna
sites, or to operate new antenna sites, as the case may be, failure to obtain such approvals could have a negative
impact on the coverage of our network. Current initiatives against 5G deployment, including constructing more
antenna with higher frequency emissions, among certain activist groups and the reaction of some politicians and
authorities on a cantonal and communal level may result in more effort and costs and a resulting delay for the
rollout of our network. This concerns not only new sites and 5G but also upgrades on existing sites and former
technologies as 3G and 4G.

Additionally, we may face increasing difficulties in finding sites to build new antennas. Such difficulties depend,
_inter alia, on a growing reluctance of landowners to have antennas installed on their properties and on the_


-----

opposition of the public against building permits. This situation may hinder the deployment of new sites and have
a negative impact on our coverage needs and our obligations under the build-to-suit program under the Cellnex
MSA.

Any such negative impact on our ability to find sites and on the coverage of our network could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any failure to comply with license conditions may jeopardize our licenses, which are required to operate our_**
**_mobile business._**

We are licensed to provide mobile telecommunications in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Any failure to meet
license conditions may jeopardize our licenses. If we cannot meet license conditions, there can be no assurance
that the Swiss and/or Liechtenstein regulator will not withdraw our existing licenses. In addition, we may not be
able to meet the license conditions due to the increased opposition regarding new or updated sites, which may
lead to delays in the granting of permits for new sites or stricter scrutiny with competent authorities regarding the
granting of such permits.

In light of the continuously evolving nature of our business, we may also be required to obtain additional licenses
in the future to keep developing our network and operating our services. Such auctions may be more expensive
than past auctions and we may not be successful in bidding for the relevant spectrum. Any failure to obtain any
such licenses in the future, because of either our failure to comply with the auction requirements, excessive bidding
costs or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We could lose the contractual rights-of-way or other network access on which we rely._**

We have entered into a number of agreements to acquire indefeasible rights of use for our fiber network going
forward. Indefeasible rights of use are commonly used in the telecommunications industry, but remain a relatively
new concept in property law. Although indefeasible rights of use give the holder a number of rights to control the
relevant rights of way or fiber optic filaments, legal title remains with the grantor of the rights. Therefore, the
legal status of indefeasible rights of use remains uncertain, and our indefeasible rights of use might be voidable
in the event of bankruptcy of the grantor. If we were to lose an indefeasible right of use in a key portion of the
network, our ability to service network customers could become seriously impaired, and we could be required to
incur significant expense to resume the operation of the fiber optic network in the affected areas. We could also
face situations where there is a conflict of interest with suppliers of our contractual rights-of-way, indefeasible
rights of use and other network access. Any loss of our indefeasible rights of use could result in a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to extensive regulation and have recently been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by_**
**_regulatory measures applicable to us or our partners._**

Our activities as an MNO in Switzerland are subject to regulation and supervision by various Swiss national
authorities, in particular ComCom and OFCOM. In addition to ComCom and OFCOM, we are also subject to
regulation and supervision by COMCO, the Competition Commission, the regulatory agency that supervises
prices of mobile services, the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (Meldestelle für Geldwäscherei)
and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht, FINMA
_(“FINMA”)) (with respect to preventive measures against money laundering in connection with the provision of_
certain services by MNOs). While Switzerland is not a member of the European Union (the “EU”) and is therefore
not subject to EU telecommunications regulation, liberalization of the Swiss mobile market has moved in parallel
with the deregulation in the EU. COMCO and ComCom could in the future take actions in respect of collective
dominance, given the current market structure, and in other areas, e.g., regarding our MTR or access to certain
services or infrastructures. Other regulatory restrictions that apply to businesses generally may also be relevant to
the conduct of our business, such as the prohibition to bundle certain services.

Based on the most recent revisions to the Swiss Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) (“FMG”) and
relevant ordinances, there are currently limited regulations in place for international roaming tariffs that apply to
our business, such as cost-limits on retail roaming prices set by customers, invoicing per second, bundled offers
with included roaming services, as well as options that allow the use of roaming services at fixed prices or reduced
standard prices; however, this could change, and the laws could be further revised, for example, through bilateral
agreements between Switzerland and the EU in order to harmonize international roaming tariffs. The new
legislation enables the Federal Council to combat disproportionately high end-user prices. The ordinance relating
to the obligation to harden the mobile networks against power outages is currently under ongoing review. The


-----

consultation phase is planned for the third quarter of 2023. Depending on the outcome, we could face effort and
costs to harden our mobile network with new/additional batteries or even diesel generators.

Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy or the interpretation or application of those laws or
regulations affecting our activities and those of our competitors could greatly influence our viability and how we
operate our business and introduce new products and services. Further liberalization of the access regime, for
example, may subject our own mobile infrastructure to certain duties to grant access at regulated conditions and
impact our margins. More generally, our ability to compete effectively in our markets could be adversely affected
if regulators decide to further expand the restrictions and obligations, resulting in additional costs, to which we
are subject, or extend such restrictions and obligations to new services and markets, or otherwise adopt regulations,
including in respect of interconnection, access or other tariffs charged by Swisscom relating to services provided
by Swisscom to its customers, in particular as universal provider. Consumer protection agencies may also make
use of their ability to initiate lawsuits to enforce claims under the Swiss Unfair Competition Act (Gesetz gegen
_den unlauteren Wettbewerb) and may engage in public campaigns aimed at changing our business practices, which_
could have an adverse effect on our ability to offer and sell our products and services.

As a telecommunication company, we are also subject to a series of other laws and regulations and changes in
such laws. Although the European Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
July 6, 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across
the European Union is not applicable to Switzerland, the Swiss legislator put in place, in January 2023, a similar
legislation in the revised ordinance and new technical and administrative guidelines to FMG regulating the
following: unauthorized manipulation of telecommunications equipment by means of telecommunications
transmissions; security of networks and services operated by mobile phone licensees; reporting of network faults,
_i.e., obliging operators of essential services to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage_
the risks posed to the security of network and information systems, to prevent and minimize the impact of incidents
affecting the security of network and information systems and to report incidents to a reporting office. The
obligation to report cyber-attacks, in line with the respective information security law is currently under discussion
in the Parliament. Such legislation could significantly increase the cost of operating our network.

On April 1, 2020, the revised Swiss Copyright Act entered into force. After initial plans to enact such legislation,
the legislator ultimately refrained from obligating internet access providers to block websites and send warning
notices to their customers to prevent copyright infringements by such customers. Future legislation may introduce
levies on internet access subscriptions in order to compensate rights holders for copying and transmitting of
protected works. A new copyright tariff for blank media entered into force on July 1, 2021 and, since June 30,
2022, extends automatically for one year at a time (unless terminated) until June 30, 2024. We are also subject to
blank media levies on the storage capacity of mobile handsets and tablets.

On January 1, 2019, the new Swiss Gambling Act (Geldspielgesetz) entered into force. The Swiss Gambling Act
provides that internet access providers must block access to foreign websites with gambling offerings that are
listed by the Federal Gambling Commission and the competent intercantonal authority.

On March 1, 2018, the revision of the Swiss Federal Act relating to the interception of telecommunications and
post services (Bundesgesetz betreffend die Überwachung des Post und Fernmeldeverkehrs (the “BÜPF”)) entered
into force. The related ordinance on the Surveillance of Postal and Telecommunications Traffic (Verordnung über
_die Überwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (the “VÜPF”)) includes new requirements in particular with_
regards to mandatory automation of the information requests, identification of postpaid customers and the storage
of an ID scan as well as logging of unsuccessful calls as part of the historical data. The fee model for the payment
of fees to telecommunication operators in respect of their tasks under the VÜPF is currently under review with
the consultation period having ended in May 2023. If the fee model changes from paying operators per task to a
lump sum model, there could be a decrease in fee payments to operators as well as an increase in tasks carried out
by operators. Additional surveillance and/or reporting obligations may also arise from the new Federal
Intelligence Services Act, which entered into force on September 1, 2017. The law provides for extended
surveillance obligations and the obligation to cooperate with the authorities in connection with interception of
international traffic. Furthermore, on June 1, 2022, the federal act on Police Measures to Combat Terrorism
(Bundesgesetz über polizeiliche Massnahmen zur Bekämpfung von Terrorismus (the “PMT”)) entered into force.
Among other things, the PMT allows the Federal Office of Police to electronically monitor and locate by mobile
communication a person who is believed to be engaged in terrorist activities.

We are also subject to the Swiss Federal Act on Cartels and other Restraints of Competition (Bundesgesetz über
_Kartelle und andere Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (the “Swiss Cartel Act”)) and other legislation, such as the_
Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Datenschutz (the “DSG”)) and associated ordinance,
the Swiss Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen (the “RTVG”)) and associated


-----

ordinance, and, with respect to certain limited services offered by the Group, the Swiss Federal Act on Combating
Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Bundesgesetz über die Bekämpfung der Geldwäscherei und der
_Terrorismusfinanzierung) and its associated ordinances and regulatory guidance. Furthermore, our advertising_
and market behavior is subject to the Swiss Federal Act against Unfair Competition (Bundesgesetz gegen den
_unlauteren Wettbewerb)._

Any of changes in laws (including with respect to pricing regime), regulations, governmental policy, interpretation
or application, including any retroactive interpretation or application thereof, could make us less competitive and
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have
received in the past requests and/or instructions from Swiss national authorities that contradicted each other and
any violation or non-compliance with any such requests and/or instructions could have resulted in the imposition
of fines or sanctions by such authorities. Although in the past we have been able to liaise with the competent
authorities and solve any contradictory requests and/or instructions received from different authorities, we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to do such in the future and that we will not be fined or sanctioned in the event of
violation or non-compliance with such requests and/or instructions. Any of these fines or sanctions could
materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Subject to bilateral or multilateral conventions, ComCom may prohibit the offering of telecommunications
services by a foreign provider (or by a provider controlled by a foreign shareholder) if the respective foreign
country does not grant the same operational freedom to Swiss incorporated providers offering services in that
particular country. Likewise, the transfer of telecommunications licenses (including an indirect transfer through a
change of control of a Swiss licensee) to a foreign provider is subject to the consent of ComCom, which might be
withheld, in particular, if no reciprocal rights are granted. According to a decision of the Swiss Federal Council
on January 29, 2014, for reasons of national security, companies with a majority of foreign shareholders are not
permitted to provide services to the federal government, which involve critical information and certain
communication infrastructures. As a result, we are unable to compete in tenders for such services, which in turn
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

These and other regulatory developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic_**
**_sanctions programs._**

We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we conduct
our operations, and in certain circumstances, with laws and regulations having extraterritorial effect such as the
US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. The anti-corruption laws
generally prohibit, among other conduct, providing anything of value to government officials for the purposes of
obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. As part of our business, we may
deal with entities, the employees of which are considered government officials. Additionally, we are required to
comply with economic sanctions regulations including those administered by the United Nations and the European
Union.

Like most national and international mobile operators, common carriers and other long distance
telecommunications service providers, we endeavor to provide our subscribers with worldwide connectivity. To
facilitate this, we enter into bilateral roaming agreements with local mobile operators around the world. Roaming
allows our customers, including both subscribers and guest roamers, to receive and make local and domestic or
international long-distance calls while traveling outside of their home networks. We therefore generate income
in some sanctioned countries (in particular, Ukraine, Russia, Cuba and Iran). In addition, we have a roaming
agreement with a telecommunications operator that is 51% owned by an Iranian shareholder that is designated on
the U.S. Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list. Fees received and expenses paid under the
roaming agreements with the operator in Iran are de minimis, and currently we are making no payments to the
Iranian telecommunications operator. We have also a roaming agreement with Megafon, a Russian
telecommunications operator which is currently listed on the sanctions lists in US, UK, EU and in Switzerland.
These sanctions do not have an impact on roaming business. In the US, OFAC issued the license no.65 authorizing
transactions related to telecommunications involving Megafon. Without this service, our clients would not have
access to telecommunications services when travelling to such countries.

Although we have internal policies and procedures in place designed to ensure compliance with applicable
anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be
sufficient or that our employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not occasionally
take actions in violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption


-----

laws and sanctions regulations) for which we may ultimately be held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption
laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties and to exclusion from government contracts and
could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.

**_Efforts to regulate specific aspects of the telecommunications market, such as full protection of the mobile_**
**_network against power outages, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations_**
**_as well as materially obstruct and hinder our ability to maintain and increase our network coverage and quality._**

As the telecommunications industry continues to evolve, we are subject to an evolving regulatory framework. In
late 2020, the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection completed the third edition of its national risk analysis
“Disasters and Emergencies in Switzerland.” According to this analysis, two of the three greatest risks are a power
shortage and the failure of the mobile phone infrastructure. Both hazards bear high damage potential with a
relatively high probability of occurrence. Due to the systemic relevance of mobile networks, especially for
emergency calls, the Swiss Federal Council regarded a serious disruption of mobile radio services, for example
as a result of a prolonged power blackout, as having a considerable impact on the population, the economy and
the authorities. The Swiss Federal Council therefore decided that nationwide power failure-proof mobile radio
coverage for emergency services should be implemented within approximately five years. In addition, in the
longer period, the Swiss Federal Council aims to guarantee nationwide coverage with mobile voice and data
services even in a power supply crisis.

At the end of 2021, the Federal Council started the consultation procedure for the revision of the Ordinance of 9
March 2007 on Telecommunications Services (“OTS”). This draft amendment will be supplemented in a second
step by further measures, namely to ensure the safety of the power supply of mobile networks. The draft will then
go through the various stages of the Swiss legislative process, i.e., a public consultation with interested parties,
possible amendments to the draft based on this consultation, discussions in the two chambers of the Swiss
Parliament and, if the draft act is not rejected by Parliament and if 50,000 citizens demand it, a referendum.

The draft amendment would present additional costs for investment and maintenance as well operation during a
crisis and power failure-proof mobile radio coverage for emergency services to telecommunication operators.
Although the legislative process for the enactment of such regulation is still in a preliminary phase, if adopted as
currently contemplated, the proposed regulation will increase our costs and we may have to increase the prices
we offer to our customers to offset these costs and could make it more difficult to find adequate sites, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to decreases in MTRs and other rates such as roaming tariffs._**

In Switzerland, the fees for access and interconnection that mobile operators charge for calls and SMS terminating
on their respective networks are determined through bilateral agreements setting out MTRs between operators,
rather than ex ante by a regulatory authority, as is the case in the EU. To the extent operators cannot mutually
agree to MTRs applicable to each of them, the Swiss regulatory authorities are entitled to intervene ex post to
determine the rates applicable to each operator. While Switzerland is not a member of the EU and not subject to
EU telecommunications regulation, MTRs in Switzerland, in particular for mobile voice and SMS, have followed,
and are expected to continue to follow, the decline in MTRs experienced in Member States.

Based on bilateral agreements, we and Sunrise reduced MTRs as of January 1, 2018 to CHF 0.039 per minute, to
CHF 0.035 per minute as of January 1, 2019, to CHF 0.034 per minute as of January 1, 2020 and to CHF 0.033
per minute as of January 1, 2021. During the same period, Swisscom reduced its MTRs to CHF 0.028 per minute.
Further reductions cannot be excluded, and a smaller competitor may demand lower rates through bilateral
negotiations or interconnection proceedings. Because MTRs are a key driver of our access, backbone,
interconnection and content revenue (for calls that terminate on our mobile network), and of our access, backbone,
interconnection and content costs (for calls that terminate on the network of other MNOs), any decrease in MTRs
has a direct impact on our revenue and on our profitability. As we have just started our own landline business in
2018, we are comparatively more affected by reductions in MTRs than our main competitors Swisscom and
Sunrise, who operate a landline business as well. From 2018 to 2020, MTRs have progressively decreased, with
MTRs with Swisscom continuing to be comparably lower than the MTRs applicable to ourselves and Sunrise.
MTRs for 2023 onwards have not been agreed yet among the operators in Switzerland. We cannot exclude further
decreases of our respective MTRs as of 2023 onwards or that our and Swisscom MTRs will be aligned in the
future. In addition, we cannot exclude that it could end up with regulated MTRs in case the operators do not find
a common agreement. A further reduction in MTRs could reduce our revenue and operating income in the future,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Similarly, in Switzerland, international and national roaming rates are not subject to extensive specific regulation.
Notwithstanding, since the entering into force of the partial revision of the FMG and of the respective ordinances


-----

in January 2021, the Swiss Federal Council introduced mechanisms to, inter alia, cap retail roaming prices, oblige
operators to per second invoices modalities for roaming and local break out as well as to oblige operators to offer
bundled offers with included roaming services as well as options that allow the use of roaming services at fixed
prices or reduced standard prices. Specifically, starting on July 1, 2021, operators are obligated to, _inter alia,_
generally invoice per second or per kilobyte for roaming. Furthermore, before initially opening up roaming for a
customer, the customer must set a price cap for roaming services, roaming options with a validity of 12 months
must be offered and the start time of a roaming option must be freely selectable. See “Regulation—Other
_Regulatory Environment—International Roaming.” Although the consequences on our revenues of the_
implementation of the new law remain difficult to quantify at this stage, any regulation of roaming or other tariffs
would likely reduce our revenue in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Conversely, we may be affected by unilateral increases of international MTRs
undertaken by other operators abroad.

**_We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or otherwise improper behavior by customers, distribution partners,_**
**_suppliers, employees and others, which our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect._**

We are exposed to the risk that customers, distribution partners, suppliers, employees and others with whom we
deal may act fraudulently. For example, some of our customers could falsify their names or use fake or stolen
documents of identification to by-pass our credit checks and verification process, use stolen credit cards for
payments or obtain unlawful access to our or other customers’ system or otherwise place large number of
fraudulent calls, _e.g., to national or international premium rate service numbers (“international revenue share_
fraud”). In addition, some of our distribution partners may by-pass our rules and processes to obtain unjustified
commissions for justified, or in some cases, fraudulent sales to our customers. While we seek to manage these
risks and take steps to detect any such fraud, we may not detect all such fraudulent activity, and, even where we
do, may not be able to prevent or recover losses incurred. Significant or regular fraudulent or improper activities
may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation and could
also lead to regulatory actions.

Furthermore, our compliance processes and internal controls may not prove sufficient to effectively prevent or
detect inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law or our policies by our subsidiaries, intermediaries,
employees, outsourced staff, directors and officers. We may be exposed to the risk that such persons receive or
grant inappropriate benefits or generally use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices. For example,
employees could grant unjustified discounts to certain customers that are inconsistent with our rate plans. Since
our employees have access to our infrastructure, it is possible that they steal money, devices and other objects of
value. In addition, our employees and contracting third parties (including outsourced staff that processes some of
our data) could use our information, confidential customer information or other confidential information provided
by third parties to us for personal or other improper purposes, as well as misrepresent or conceal improper
activities from us. Such practices could result in legal sanctions, penalties and loss of business as well as harm to
our reputation. Our employees and contracting third parties (including outsourced staff that processes some of our
data) may also commit errors or take actions that could subject us to financial claims for negligence or otherwise
as well as regulatory actions. Such errors or actions could result in unforeseen business risk, losses, and regulatory
and other sanctions, could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation, including financial losses resulting
from the need to reimburse customers or business partners or as a result of fines or other regulatory sanctions.

**_Our shareholder and certain of our affiliates are highly engaged in our business, and adverse changes to our_**
**_relationship could cause our operations to suffer._**

We work closely with NJJ and certain of our affiliates in the management of our operations and the in-sourcing
of our IT and network operations. Our success is highly dependent on maintaining our relationship with Xavier
Niel, one of our directors and our majority shareholder, as well as other members of the NJJ team. If NJJ were to
lose its key professionals, NJJ may need to replace such professionals, or we may need to find employees or other
advisors to replace the services NJJ provides to us. Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend
significant time serving, other entities and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest
in allocating time to our business. In addition, we may lose or renegotiate at different and/or less convenient terms
our arrangements with NJJ affiliates regarding the provision of IT, network and other services. Any such factor
may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to attract and retain key personnel and may experience difficulty or incur costs in replacing_**
**_such personnel and in integrating new personnel._**

We have a lean operating model and relatively small teams compared to our competitors. Our success and our
growth strategy depend in large part on the contribution of our key executives, our ability to attract and retain key
management, marketing, finance and operating personnel, including the engineers and technicians that develop


-----

our in-house hardware and software. In particular, given our lean operating model, the loss of even a small number
of key personnel, should we be unable to replace them with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can
be no assurance that we will continue to attract or retain the qualified personnel needed for our business.
Competition for qualified managers in our industry is intense, and there is limited availability of persons with the
requisite knowledge of the telecommunications industry and relevant experience in Switzerland. Immigration laws
may further restrict our ability to attract or hire qualified personnel. To the extent that the demand for qualified
personnel exceeds supply, we could experience a delay or higher labor costs in order to attract and retain qualified
managers and personnel from time to time. In addition, as new personnel join our management, we may face a
number of challenges typically associated with the integration and assimilation of new managers and key
personnel, such as changes in organizational and reporting structures, the need to recruit additional new personnel
or the departure of existing personnel. An inability to address these challenges can result in the diversion of
management’s attention from our daily operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our
strategy. Our failure to recruit and retain key personnel or qualified employees, or effectively integrate new
managers and other key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Our pension liability may reduce our cash flows, profitability, financial condition, net assets, distributable_**
**_reserves and our ability to pay dividends._**

We operate a “defined contribution plan with minimum interest guarantee” pension scheme that, due to certain
guarantees that the plan is required to provide under Swiss legislation, is treated as a defined benefit agreement
for the purposes of IFRS. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Group plan assets amounted to CHF
135.7 million, while the Group had a defined benefit obligation of CHF 135.7 million. This results in the
recognition of no pension liability in the Group’s condensed statement of financial position. The pension liability
could further increase depending, among other things, on changes in the valuation of publicly traded equities,
exchange rates, interest rates and market conditions. In addition, the management of the pension fund could also
affect its valuation.

Under the Swiss accounting principles, the pension plan of Salt Mobile SA is overfunded by 106% as of December
31, 2022. Should the Swiss effective market valuation of the pension fund at any time disclose a significant
underfunding of our pension fund, we could be obliged to make additional contributions into the pension plan in
addition to the normal contributions defined in the pension plan regulations. Such contributions may adversely
affect our ability to distribute dividends or service our debt and generally have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Current income tax prior to 2021 and income tax paid in previous financial years may not be indicative of_**
**_future tax expenses and future income tax payment given a change in our statutory accounting policies._**

From 2017 to 2020, tangible and intangible assets were depreciated using the declining-balance method in our
statutory and tax accounts, which permitted the reporting of larger depreciation expenses during the earlier years
of an asset’s useful life when compared with the straight-line depreciation method, and therefore permitted the
deferral of the payment of current income tax expenses to the later years of an asset’s useful life. In 2021, we
decided to revert to the straight-line depreciation method for our statutory and tax accounts. Since 2021, the change
in the depreciation method has triggered the recognition of lower statutory and tax depreciation expenses, resulting
in an increase in current income tax. Due to tax collection being based on the former level of income tax, tax
payments have remained below the current tax expenses in the last two years. As a result the cumulated income
tax payables as of March 31, 2023 totaled CHF 69.7 million and will result in income tax payments being greater
than the current income tax in the future years. Current income tax for financial years prior to 2021 and income
tax paid may therefore not be indicative of the future income tax and future income tax payment.

**_Our insurance may not be adequate to cover losses or liabilities that may arise._**

We maintain insurance for some, but not all, the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. Any
damage or failure that causes an interruption in services could reduce our revenue and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, while our property risk insurance covers
certain property damage caused by natural disasters up to a specified limit, we do not carry insurance for all
damage and losses caused by natural disasters. Further, insurance against acts of terrorism is not always available
in each jurisdiction in which we operate or may be prohibitively expensive. If we seek to obtain additional
insurance coverage in the future, insurance may only be available at premium levels that are prohibitively
expensive. To the extent such losses or payments are not insured or the insured amount is not adequate, losses
incurred or payments we may be required to make may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

**_We face legal and regulatory dispute risks._**

We are currently subject to more than 100 pending network cases (related to specific antenna sites), which can be
split into three categories: (i) appeals against the relevant building permit applications for antenna sites
(approximately 66% of the total cases), where, in case of a negative outcome, we would not be allowed to build
or upgrade such site(s), (ii) appeals against the termination of site lease contracts (approximately 4% of the total
cases), where, in case of a negative outcome, we would be obliged to dismantle such site, losing the related revenue
and face the investment for the acquisition of a replacement site and (iii) appeals against newly established
planning zones (approximately 30% of the total cases). Appeals against the relevant building applications are
usually based on aesthetics and health-related concerns, claims for spatial planning coordination and claimed
diminution of value. With an increasing opposition against 5G, we may expect more administrative appeals and
regulation against new antenna sites and upgrades of existing ones.

We are also subject to numerous risks relating to legal and civil, tax, regulatory and competition proceedings to
which we are a party or in which we are otherwise involved or which could develop in the future, and certain of
these proceedings (or proceedings in which we may become involved), if adversely resolved, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our involvement in
legal, regulatory and competition proceedings may harm our reputation. We cannot assure you what the ultimate
outcome of any particular legal proceeding will be.

From time to time, we are also party to commercial disputes. In August 2021, we settled a commercial dispute
with a partner with whom we had a wholesale roaming discount agreement governing the provision of roaming
services by both parties and which set commercially agreed discounted inter operator tariffs for use of a party’s
network by customers of the other party. The dispute concerned the tariff rate applicable to certain of our
customers and how the traffic generated by certain of such customers should have been characterized. Should we
fail to make the installment payments as set forth under the settlement agreement, we may be required to pay to
our partner the then outstanding amount plus default interest. We are currently involved in a commercial
arbitration dispute with an Iranian telecommunication operator with whom we have concluded a wholesale
roaming agreement. The dispute concerns the debt waiver clauses. This dispute is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company. We cannot exclude that similar disputes concerning roaming or other commercial matters
could result in legal or arbitration proceedings, nor that the outcome of such proceeding could be adverse and,
further, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not achieve our ESG targets relating to carbon emission reduction_**

Our operations and value chain has a negative environmental impact, in particular in terms of greenhouse gas
(“GHG”) emissions and of electronic waste (“e-waste”). The majority of GHG emissions are generated in the
supply chain, while e-waste is primarily associated with end of life of mobile devices, routers and network
equipment. We are seeing increasing requirements and expectations from customers, policy makers, investors and
others stakeholders to manage these negative impacts. There is also increasing regulatory and self-regulatory
pressure worldwide in relation to areas such as energy efficiency in data centers and extending the lifetime of
electronic devices. Such requirements may lead to increased costs for us. Our target is to reduce our emissions on
Scopes 1 and 2 – i.e., essentially the direct emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion for mobility and
heating, and electricity – and fully offset the remaining emissions on these Scopes by 2025. Since January 1, 2021,
our main offices and in-house data center are supplied with 100% electricity from renewable sources. We are also
preparing a net zero roadmap in compliance with the Science-Based Targets initiative and the 2015 Paris
Agreement.

The worsening of climate change increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events such as heat
waves floods and windstorms which may cause severe disruptions to telecommunications and ICT services,
reduce the work efficiency (hours actually worked), have a consequential impact on our business. More extreme
weather may also drive the need for additional investments in cooling technology and other more resilient
infrastructure. Failure to implement circular business models such as offering of products designed with ecosustainable criteria or the use of recyclable materials may lead to lost opportunities for cost savings and a failure
to realize additional revenues. Failure to meet stakeholders’ requirements or expectations may lead to reputational
loss, loss of business or limit access to sustainable finance. Increasing electricity prices, the availability of
renewable energy certificates or the possible introduction of carbon taxation could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We collect and process subscriber data as part of our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate_**
**_laws and regulations which could result in fines, loss of reputation and subscriber churn and adversely affect_**
**_our business._**

We collect, store and use data in the ordinary course of our operations that is protected by data protection laws.
Although we take precautions to protect subscriber data in accordance with the privacy requirements provided for
under applicable laws, we may fail to do so and certain subscriber data may be leaked as a result of human error
or technological failure or otherwise be used inappropriately. We work with independent and third-party sales
agents, service providers and call center agents and other third parties, and we cannot exclude that such third
parties could also experience system failures involving the storing or the transmission of proprietary information
or violate contractual obligations or data protection laws. Violation of data protection laws may result in fines,
loss of reputation and subscriber churn and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks._**

In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data and proprietary business information. We could
be subject to service outages, denial-of-service attacks, ransom and blackmailing or breaches of security systems,
which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation or corruption of this information. Security
breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages or hacks,
computer viruses, other attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns or
unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we are not aware of any significant incidents to
date, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may
suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage or regulatory penalties because of lost or
misappropriated information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could
subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement
actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.

If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws or contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach,
such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and this could in
turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we seek to ensure that procedures are in place to
ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by our employees and any third-party service
providers, and also implement security measures to help prevent cyber theft, we nonetheless are exposed to the
risk that this data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection
legislation. Managing these risks have become more difficult in connection with working-from-home policies that
we adopted in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and exposes us to additional risk for which additional
work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent the occurrences from happening. Ransomware and
cyber risks have increased in recent years and have also required us to invest in even more strict back-up
procedures, leading to higher operating costs for all of its information technologies. In addition, concerns
regarding our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other
privacy-related matters could result in negative publicity and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and
business and thus on our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content._**

We provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products
and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The
laws relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still
somewhat unsettled. Claims may be threatened or brought against us for defamation, negligence, breach of
contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal
injury, fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we
provide links or that may be posted or exchanged online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users.
In addition, we could be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have
generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates law.

We also place advertisements which are displayed on third-party publishers and advertising networks properties,
and we offer third-party products, services or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products,
services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to
them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide or provide access to these products, services or content.
Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and


-----

other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an
adverse manner.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

We are highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we would have had total
financial debt of CHF 1,783.4 million. See “Capitalization.” Furthermore, we frequently enter into indefeasible
rights of use contracts for fiber activities and the related payables are not included in our total financial debt, but
represent a material amount of debt that is expected to further increase depending on our fiber subscriber base
evolution.

Our high leverage could have important consequences to holders of the Notes in this Offering, including, but not
limited to:

#### • making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; 

 • increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

#### • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow
to fund working capital, capital expenditure, spectrum license payments, acquisitions, joint
ventures, product research and development, subscriber acquisition costs or other general
corporate purposes;

#### • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

#### • placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged; and

#### • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. 

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

#### • incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; 

 • create or incur certain liens; 

 • make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of
the Parent Guarantor or its restricted subsidiaries;

#### • prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; 

 • make certain investments; 

 • create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Parent Guarantor or any of its restricted
subsidiaries;

#### • sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; 

 • engage in certain transactions with affiliates; 

 • enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities; 


-----

#### • consolidate or merge with other entities; 

 • impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and 

 • amend certain documents. 

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations_
and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Existing Remaining Indentures. In particular, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility requires
us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy a financial condition test if more than CHF 35.0 million is
outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to meet that financial ratio test may be
affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of any of those
covenants or that ratio test or other restrictions could result in an event of default under the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement,
subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could
cancel the availability of the facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under
the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture and the Existing
Remaining Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement,
accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries
would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would
be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are
unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure
repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to sustain_**
**_our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Existing Senior
Facilities and our obligations under the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations,
will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to
general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors
discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. Our Existing Senior Facilities will
mature in 2026, the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes will mature in 2027, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior
Secured Notes will mature in 2026 and the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes will mature in 2024. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Existing
Senior Facilities, the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the Notes or any other debt which we may incur, if we do not have
sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other
liquidity needs or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we
may be required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness
or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities
or capital expenditure, sell assets, or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial.
The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in
the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely
manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Indenture, the Existing Remaining Indentures and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue
any of these measures.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_**
**_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate_**
**_our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that we incur at our subsidiary level would be
structurally senior to the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although, the
Indenture will contain, and the Existing Remaining Indentures and the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement
contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of


-----

significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total
indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could
negatively affect their trading price. In addition, the Indenture will not, and the Existing Remaining Indentures
and the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and do not, prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which_**
**_may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing_**
**_indebtedness._**

We or our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, in connection with a refinancing of our existing debt
or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different
financing alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets, incur
other indebtedness or enter into liability management transactions, including vendor financing transactions by a
special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured credit facilities, from time to time, including prior to, or
within a short time period after the Issue Date. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election,
and if such debt is in the form of securities, may be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a
separate offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time
of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the
Notes and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which
would have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity
date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or
later than the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would
be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the
Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will elect to raise
any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as
to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt
in addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as described
above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors,” could intensify.

**_The Existing Senior Facilities bear interests at floating rates. Such floating rates could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The Existing Senior Facilities bear interests at floating rates of interest per annum equal to SARON and/or
EURIBOR, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future.
Although we intend to fix a portion of these rates in the future as part of the Refinancing pursuant to hedging
agreements, there can be no assurance that such hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms for as long as such indebtedness remains outstanding. To the extent that interest rates were to increase
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results._**

Some of our debt service requirements are denominated in euro and, following the issuance of the Notes, will
continue to be denominated in euro even though substantially all of our cash flow from operations is generated in
Swiss francs. Significant changes in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the euro could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on euro-denominated
debt, including the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the Notes offered hereby, any euro-denominated borrowings under
the Existing Senior Facilities and any euro-denominated borrowings under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement. Although we hedge a portion of our exchange rate exposure, there can be no assurance that such
hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms for as long as such indebtedness remains
outstanding.

**_Our interest and cross-currency swap agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if_**
**_our counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We entered into interest and currency hedging agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates under our Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, Existing Euro 2026
Senior Secured Notes, Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and may enter into further agreements with
respect to the Notes offered hereby. Under these agreements, we may be exposed to credit risks of our


-----

counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap
agreements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate our
hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**_We may be subject to financial risks related to Swiss and foreign tax compliance._**

We have and continue to develop our business by implementing new products and internal process changes. As
we operationalize these changes, we cannot assure what the ultimate outcome of any particular direct or indirect
tax audit would be. Legislative changes in particular can have implications on our process streams and controls.
In addition, as some of our network equipment is located outside of Switzerland, we may be subject to an extended
taxation, due to the fact that such equipment could be linked to the definition of a “Permanent Establishment”
(“PE”) according to the OECD guidelines. We continue to assess and manage any tax issues in relation to possible
PE topics.

**Risks Related to the Collateral**

**_Certain hedging obligations are, or will be, entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the collateral securing_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes in priority to the Senior Secured Notes._**

Certain hedging obligations are, or will be, “super priority” debt under the Existing Remaining Indentures, the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Existing Remaining Indentures and the Indenture,
commitments in an amount not to exceed the greater of CHF 224.0 million and 0.4 multiplied by Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) and certain hedging obligations may be
secured by “super priority” liens on the collateral. The Existing Remaining Indentures, the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement do not, and the Indenture will not, limit the amount of
hedging that can be “super priority” hedging. Any “super priority” hedging obligations will be secured by the
same property and assets that secure the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Facilities and that will secure
the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from enforcement sales of assets that are part
of the collateral securing the Notes or amounts paid under any guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes after
enforcement must first be applied in satisfaction in full of obligations under any “super priority” hedging
obligations; only thereafter can they be applied to repay the obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors under the
Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees thereof, as applicable. As such, in the event of enforcement of such
collateral, you may not be able to recover on the collateral if the then-outstanding liabilities under any “super
priority” hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized in such enforcement sale.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the collateral._**

The Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024
Euro Senior Secured Notes and the Notes will be secured by the same collateral that secures the obligations under
the Existing Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations. In addition, under the terms of the Existing
Remaining Indentures and the Indenture, we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other
obligations that may be secured by the same collateral.

As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, under certain circumstances, the
lenders under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements could
have effective control of all decisions with respect to the collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, a
common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement, Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging agreements. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the
Security Agent will act with respect to such collateral only at the direction of an “Instructing Group.”

Before any group of creditors sharing in the collateral may give enforcement instructions to the Security Agent,
the representative of the relevant creditors must first consult with each other representative of creditor groups
sharing in the collateral (in each case including the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
and the agent on behalf of the lenders under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement), certain counterparties to
hedging agreement and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days. Upon conclusion of the
consultation period, if there are conflicting enforcement instructions given to the Security Agent by the different
classes of creditors which are secured by the collateral and who can constitute an Instructing Group, then provided
that the Senior Instructing Group Creditors (as defined in and according to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) whose senior secured credit participations at that time aggregate to more than 66.66% of the total
senior instructing group credit participations have complied with any other applicable requirements set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any applicable requirements in the Security Documents, the enforcement instructions
from those Senior Instructing Group Creditors (as defined below) will prevail over those of the lenders under the


-----

Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and the counterparties under certain hedging agreement and those Senior
Instructing Group Creditors will constitute the Instructing Group. The senior secured credit participations include,
as applicable, drawn and undrawn uncancelled commitments under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and
amounts payable in respect of certain hedging obligations that have been terminated or closed out or that would
be payable if such certain hedging obligations had been terminated or closed out and the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes and drawn and undrawn uncancelled commitments and/or (as applicable) the principal
amount of any permitted additional indebtedness (with each holder exercising its own vote). The total senior
instructing group credit participations comprise, prior to the date on which the liabilities under the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement and related finance documents are discharged in full, the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and drawn and undrawn uncancelled commitments and/or (as applicable) the principal amount of
any permitted additional indebtedness and, on and after the date on which the liabilities under the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement and related finance documents are discharged in full, amounts payable in respect of certain
hedging obligations that have been terminated or closed out or that would be payable if such certain hedging
obligations had been terminated or closed out and the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and drawn
and undrawn uncancelled commitments and/ or (as applicable) the principal amount of any permitted additional
indebtedness. In certain circumstances (for example, if the Senior Creditors have not been fully repaid within six
months of the end of the first consultation period referred to above, or if no steps have been taken as to enforcement
by the Security Agent within three months of the end of the first consultation period or if an insolvency event has
occurred and no steps have been taken as to enforcement by the Security Agent at that time), the instructions of
the requisite majority of the Senior Creditors will then prevail. In addition, there are also customary “override”
provisions if necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Creditors.

The “Senior Instructing Group Creditors” are determined as follows:

prior to the date on which the liabilities under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and
related finance documents are discharged in full, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and
the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness; and

on and after the date on which the liabilities under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and
related finance documents are discharged in full, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and
the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness and the counterparties to the hedging
agreement.

In summary, prior to the date on which the liabilities under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and related
finance documents are discharged in full, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will vote as an independent
class to the extent there is no other permitted additional indebtedness. On and after the date on which the liabilities
under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and related finance documents are discharged in full, the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will vote as a combined creditor class with the counterparties to certain hedging
agreements and the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness.

The holders of the Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of collateral or otherwise independently pursue
the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, unless they comprise an Instructing
Group which is entitled to give such instructions, which, in turn, will depend on conditions and circumstances
described above. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and creditors under our
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the counterparties to certain hedging agreements or holders of any permitted
additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect
to the collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be bound by any decisions of the
Instructing Group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the collateral, whether or not such action
is approved by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The creditors under
the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the counterparties to certain hedging agreements or the holders of any
permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would
otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, if the Security Agent sells collateral comprising the shares of Salt or the shares of any of our other
subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the
Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees thereof and the liens over any other assets securing the Senior Secured
Notes and the guarantees thereof may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_


-----

**_The collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The guarantees of the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes
and the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes are, and the guarantees of the Notes will be, secured by
security interests in the collateral described in this Offering Memorandum, which certain collateral will also secure
the obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement. The collateral may also secure additional debt to
the extent permitted by the terms of the Existing Remaining Indentures, the Indenture, the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the collateral may be diluted by any increase
in the first-priority debt secured by the collateral or a reduction of the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes.

The value of the collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such collateral will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale, economic conditions
where operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the collateral should not be relied
on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the collateral may be illiquid and may have
no readily ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of
the collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition,
the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.
The collateral is located in more than one country, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the
collateral may limit the realizable value of the collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative
and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including
in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest
and duration of the proceedings.

In addition, our business requires a variety of national, state and local permits and licenses. In the event of
foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked or the transfer of such permits and licenses may be
prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. We cannot assure you that the applicable
governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of our licenses and permits. If the regulatory approvals
required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be
delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of our operations may result and the value of the collateral may be
significantly decreased.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes._**

The collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors
that have the benefit of priority security interests in the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, from time to
time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes,
as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of
security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in collateral. For example, under both Luxembourg and Swiss law, the enforcement
of a share pledge, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The
Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest in certain
jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also
cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on
such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value
of the collateral may decline significantly.

**_The security interests in the collateral have been granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the_**
**_holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the collateral may be restricted by_**
**_local law._**

The security interests in the collateral that secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Guarantees have not and will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but have
been granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Existing Remaining Indentures provide, and the Indenture
will provide, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the
Security Documents. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Security Documents may be restricted under
local law. As a consequence of the right to enforce the Security Documents, holders of the Notes will not have
direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the collateral securing the


-----

Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the Existing
Remaining Indentures, as applicable) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the collateral.

The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the
designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending
on the type of the security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated
August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended, a security (financial collateral) may be
provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the
claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are
determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of the
security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same
rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law.

Under Swiss law, “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the
creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties
who do not hold the secured claim. If and to the extent the beneficial holders of the Senior Secured Notes from
time to time will not be party to such Swiss law governed “accessory” security agreements, there may be a risk
regarding the validity and/or enforceability of such security interest granted in favor of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. In order to mitigate such risk, the Swiss law governed security interests in the form of a pledge in
certain of the collateral (including the share pledge of Salt) that will constitute security for the obligations of the
Issuer will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but only in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary
of parallel debt obligations (the “Parallel Debt”). This Parallel Debt is created by way of an abstract
acknowledgment of debt (abstraktes Schuldanerkenntnis) to satisfy a requirement under the laws of Switzerland
that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant debtor of the secured
obligations. The Parallel Debt is in the same amounts and payable at the same times as the obligations of the Issuer
under the Existing Remaining Indentures and the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect
of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have,
pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer for the full aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement, which is governed by English law, and are also agreed and acknowledged under the Existing
Remaining Indentures, which is governed by New York law. Also, the parallel debt structure is untested under
Swiss law, and there is no certainty that such a structure will be held valid and enforceable under Swiss law and
be effective before the Swiss courts as it may be deemed to constitute a circumvention of the accessory nature of
the pledge and there are no court precedents or other relevant guidance as to its effectiveness or permissibility. To
the extent that the parallel debt structure is successfully challenged, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce
any Swiss law governed “accessory” collateral may be restricted, and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
may not receive any proceeds from an enforcement thereof. Moreover, the instruction and appointment of an agent
and any power of attorney may be revoked at any time under Swiss law notwithstanding the appointment,
instruction or power of attorney being said to be irrevocable and any mandate may, as a matter of statutory law,
be terminated at any time by each party to the mandate.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the_**
**_Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments in its subsidiaries. The Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to
meet its obligations. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet its obligations on the Notes through
a combination of dividends, distribution of available share premium reserves and intercompany loans.

Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts
that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or
even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Company to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally
be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available at the Company. Under Swiss law, all dividends may
only be distributed out of distributable reserves, and, in principle, interim dividends are not allowed under Swiss
law. It is, however, uncertain under Swiss law whether interim dividends may be allowed in certain circumstances,
subject to strict conditions. The distributable reserves of Salt may also be reduced by the amount of any upstream
or cross-stream intercompany loan provided by Salt which is not at arm’s length terms. Under Luxembourg law,
all dividends may only be distributed out of distributable reserves, and any interim dividend distribution by a


-----

public limited liability company shall be subject to strict conditions. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that
do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even
though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be
permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their
restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_Our intercompany financing is subject to strict legal requirements._**

Under the Swiss legal regime governing intercompany loans, upstream loans must be entered into on arm’s length
terms. If not at arm’s length, such loans constitute de facto distributions and may only be granted for an amount
that does not exceed the lender’s freely distributable reserves. The court also imposed stringent requirements on
satisfying the arm’s length test. In addition, the court held that an upstream loan that is not entered into at market
terms reduces the lender’s ability for future dividend distributions by the amount corresponding to the loan. Our
financial structure includes, inter alia, a significant upstream loan granted by the Company to the Issuer. Although
we believe that such loan is entered into at arm’s length terms, we cannot exclude that such assessment may not
be upheld by a court which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations,
including the Notes.

**_The tax treatment of the Notes with respect to Swiss withholding tax is not yet confirmed by the Swiss tax_**
**_authorities._**

The tax treatment of the Notes with respect to the Swiss withholding tax has, in principle, been confirmed by the
Swiss Federal Tax Administration. The final tax ruling request is in the process of being confirmed by the Swiss
Federal Tax Administration. Although we have no reason to believe that this confirmation will not be received,
we cannot assure you that such tax ruling confirming that no Swiss withholding tax applies will be obtained. See
“Taxation—Swiss Tax Considerations.”

**_Payments of interest in respect of the Notes could become subject to Swiss Withholding Taxes._**

We intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering outside of Switzerland (as opposed to a harmful “use of
proceeds in Switzerland” as interpreted by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration for purposes of Swiss
Withholding Tax). Payments of interest in respect of the Notes would become subject to Swiss Withholding Tax
(Verrechnungssteuer), such that Swiss Withholding Tax would be required to be withheld at the applicable rate
(currently 35%) from any payments of interest under the Notes, if the proceeds of the Notes were directly or
indirectly used in Switzerland in any kind of intragroup financing which would constitute a harmful “use of
proceeds in Switzerland” as interpreted by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration for purposes of Swiss
Withholding Tax. See “Taxation—Swiss Tax Considerations.” A gross-up for withholding taxes might be held
void or unenforceable in Switzerland as a consequence of mandatory Swiss tax provisions.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including, without limitation:

#### • in the case of collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition to any third party of
the property or assets constituting collateral, so long as the sale or other disposition is permitted
by the Indenture or to the Parent Guarantor or any restricted subsidiary consistent with the
Intercreditor Agreement;

#### • in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

#### • in accordance with the “Amendments and Waivers” provisions of the Indenture; 

 • upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and “Description of the
_Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge,” respectively;_

#### • in connection with a Permitted Reorganization (as defined under “Description of the Notes—
_Certain definitions”;_


-----

#### • if the Company designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the
release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

#### • automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge
thereof);

#### • in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

 • as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”; or_

#### • with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor
pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer
or a Guarantor.

Unless consented to by the holders of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent
shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the Guarantees or security interests in the
collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

#### • for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; 

 • to the extent there is a release of Guarantees or security granted for the benefit of the holders of
any senior notes, concurrently with the discharge or release of the indebtedness of the disposed
entities of certain other creditors, including the creditors under the Existing Senior Facilities
and holders of the Senior Secured Notes, unless each agent for the senior creditors determines
that the senior creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise
transferred to the purchaser of the disposed entities and not released and discharged; and

#### • pursuant to a public auction, or a fairness opinion has been obtained from a financial advisor
selected by the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in
connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Parent Guarantor has
confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined that it is either not possible or not desirable to
implement any such refinancing on terms satisfactory to it by instead granting additional collateral and/or
amending the terms of the existing collateral. In certain jurisdictions, such a release and retaking of collateral may
give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such collateral. Under certain circumstances, other
creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of
the grant of such collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of
such collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if_**
**_any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

The Guarantors are the only guarantors that will guarantee the Notes as of the Issue Date. Generally, claims of
creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any)
of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of
creditors of its parent entity and any intercompany loans and by holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In the
event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade
creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any
assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be
structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our
non-Guarantor subsidiaries for the Notes. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors that
will guarantee the Notes and which guarantee the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Senior Facilities,
represented 99.2% of the Group’s EBITDA and 99.0% of the Group’s revenue. As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, the Parent Guarantor’s direct or indirect subsidiaries that will not guarantee any of the Notes
(Salt (Liechtenstein) AG and Salt Services S.A.) generated 0.8% of the Group’s EBITDA and 1.0% of the Group’s
revenue.

**_Your rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the
collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security
Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, the Security Agent
has no responsibility or obligation to perfect the liens on the collateral.

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are formed by the mere agreement (consentement) between the parties thereto.
Additional steps, however, are required to enforce security interests against third parties.

Securities such as pledges, and transfer of ownership as a security, granted on financial instruments and claims
are governed by the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as
amended. Pursuant to this law, a pledge is effected, not by transfer of title, but by a transfer of possession of the
pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference
rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in
possession of such assets.

A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Luxembourg Act
dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended, provides for a fictitious transfer
of possession which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case
of registered shares, the dispossession is achieved by the entry of the security interest in the register of the issuer.
Dispossession of cash collateral or rights under contracts is achieved by the security interest thereon being notified
by the debtor/co-contractor or by the acceptance thereof by the debtor of such claims or the co-contractor.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider
until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security
provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally,
since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a
security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which come into force for third parties earlier
(by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

**_Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_**
**_by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis. Each Guarantee will provide the relevant
holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors
will secure the payment of the Notes on a senior secured basis by granting security under the relevant Security
Documents. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging agreements,
however, will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes in
priority to holders of the Senior Secured Notes. There is no guarantee that the value of the Guarantees or the
collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. Notwithstanding, the Indenture will provide for
general limitation language to the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other
obligation, liability or indemnification under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed/secured by the relevant Guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations
and exposure of the Guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant Guarantee/security interest
voidable or otherwise ineffective under Luxembourg, Swiss and other applicable law, and enforcement of each
Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses
include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

Luxembourg law also provides for specific limitations with respect to financial assistance. In particular, any
security interests/guarantees granted by entities organized in Luxembourg, which constitute breach of the
provisions on financial assistance as defined by article 430-19 of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on
commercial companies, as amended (the “Companies Act 1915”), or any other similar provisions (to the extent
applicable, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, to an entity organized under the laws of Luxembourg and
having the form of a private limited liability company) might not be enforceable.


-----

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court
could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security Documents and, if
payment had already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document,
require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor/security provider, if the court found that:

#### • the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law;

#### • the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor/security provider
or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor/
security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;

#### • the Guarantor/security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value
for the relevant Guarantee/security interest and the Guarantor/security provider was:
(i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee/security interest,
(ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/Security
Document, or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity; or

#### • the relevant Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects/
corporate purposes of the Guarantor/security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the
corporate benefit of the Guarantor/security provider.

The validity or enforceability of a security interest granted or a guarantee issued by a Swiss guarantor may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, re-organization, corporate, tax, contract or similar laws, regulations
or defenses affecting creditors and secured parties in general (including provisions relating to fraudulent transfer,
voidable preference, corporate purpose, financial assistance, capital maintenance and solvency) or laws or
principles of general application (including the abuse of rights (Rechtsmissbrauch) and the principle of good faith
(Grundsatz von Treu und Glauben) and public policy.

In particular, since the Guarantees and security interests under the Security Documents as well as any other
obligation, liability or indemnification under the Security Documents granted by Salt constitute
obligations/guarantees/security for liabilities of direct or indirect shareholders (so-called “upstream
obligations/guarantees/security”), the liability of Salt under its Guarantee and security interests granted by Salt
under the Security Documents is limited under Swiss law (i) insofar as such upstream
obligations/guarantees/security must be within the corporate purpose and interests of such Swiss security provider
and (ii) to the amount of such Swiss security provider’s freely disposable equity, being the balance sheet profits
and non-statutory reserves available for the distribution as dividends at the time of enforcement of the Guarantees
and the security interests under the Security Documents. The payment of dividends from Salt to the Issuer will
reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and the
Security Documents. Under the Swiss legal regime governing intercompany loans, the distributable reserves of
Salt may be reduced by the amount of any upstream or cross-stream intercompany loan provided by Salt which is
not at arm’s length terms. See “—Our intercompany financing is subject to strict legal requirements.”

We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have
distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments that reduce our distributable profits and
reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends to service indebtedness and for tax-planning purposes. There can
be no assurance that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the
Guarantees and the Security Documents, whether or not we make dividends. The payment of dividends to service
our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the
obligations under the Guarantees and the Security Documents. In addition, the enforcement of upstream
obligations (i.e. payment under the Guarantee by Salt and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant
Security Documents) may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited
to, obtaining an audit report determining the freely distributable reserves at the time of enforcement under then
applicable law, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. Moreover, the enforcement of a Swiss security
provider’s Guarantee and the security interest granted by them under the Security Documents may give rise to
Swiss withholding taxes on dividends (of up to 35% at present rates, subject to applicable double-taxation treaties)
to the extent that the payment or enforcement of security interest have to be regarded as a deemed distribution by
a Swiss security provider to the Issuer or any other related party and the obligations of a Swiss security provider
to gross-up by paying additional amounts may not be enforceable under Swiss law. In addition, the Guarantees


-----

and security interests under the Security Documents will be limited to the maximum amount such that the amount
of indebtedness for which interest is deductible would not be exceeded; this amount would be tested annually. It
is expected that initially this amount would be low or close to zero. In addition, financial assistance rules are
uncertain under Swiss law. We cannot provide any assurance that future court rulings will not further restrict the
enforceability, or deny the validity, of guarantees and security interests. Such rulings would negatively affect the
ability to enforce the guarantee and security interests granted by Salt. Further, Swiss corporate law rules may
significantly impact the value of the Guarantees or security interests under the Security Documents.

The Companies Act 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee
the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the
guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purposes, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the
company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law,
corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or
indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the
benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. The provision of guarantee/security interest for the
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of
cross-stream and upstream guarantees/security interests may be more problematic. It is generally held that within
a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent,
the interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee being
held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group
company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this
assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting company (i.e., limited to
an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux propres)), the company must
receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates and the
companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common
objective. As a result, the guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to
limitations in order to ensure their enforceability.

Further, a guarantee/security interest that substantially exceeds the guarantor’s/security provider’s ability to meet
its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee/security provider and to its other creditors, or from which the
Luxembourg company derives no or very limited personal benefit in return, or where no direct or indirect
consideration is granted to the company in exchange, would expose its directors or managers to personal liability.
In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the manager or director of the Luxembourg company, in
extreme circumstances the guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is
contrary to public policy (ordre public), in the case of facts consisting of a misuse of corporate assets. The
Guarantees granted by Luxembourg companies may be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the
relevant company’s own funds (capitaux propres).

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law applied. For
example, generally, a Luxembourg company would be considered insolvent if it is demonstrated that it is in a state
of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de
_crédit). The following transactions must be declared null and void if they were undertaken during the so-called_
“suspect period” (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months (and ten days, depending on the transaction
in question) preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy:

#### • disposition of the assets without consideration or for materially inadequate consideration; 

 • payments of debts which had not fallen due, whether the payment was in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off, or by any other means;

#### • payments of debts which had fallen due, by any other means than in cash or by bills of exchange;
and

#### • mortgages or pledges granted to secure pre-existing debts. 

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and Switzerland may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering_**
**_payments due on the Notes._**

_Luxembourg_

The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and, in the event of
insolvency, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Luxembourg. The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may


-----

not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which
you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that an
Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any future guarantor incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg (a “Luxembourg
Guarantor”) experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings)
may be opened against an entity having its center of main interests in Luxembourg or an establishment within the
meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on
insolvency proceedings, as applicable:

#### • bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by
any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open
bankruptcy proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des
_paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a_
Luxembourg court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy
proceedings, ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect
of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company,
except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the
payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets;

#### • controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order provisional
suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; and

#### • composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), which may be requested only by
the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its
creditors themselves. The court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings
triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to
grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire).
Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing
an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the laws
governing commercial companies, including the Companies Act 1915. The management of such liquidation
proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.

Liability of the Issuer or any Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of
the entity following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are
entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

#### • certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; 

 • value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; 

 • social security contributions; and 

 • remuneration owed to employees. 

Pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements,
as amended, all collateral arrangements in respect of assets over which the Luxembourg security interests have
been granted, as well as all enforcement events and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the
parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable against third parties, commissioners, receivers,
liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings.

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability
of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of
controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final
decision has been taken by the Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be
affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval


-----

by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities
in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon
the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the relevant
Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “suspect period” (période suspecte)
which is a maximum of six months (and ten days, depending on the transaction in question) preceding the
judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect
period at an earlier date; if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency bankruptcy judgment
under Luxembourg law, the court may set the maximum up to six months prior to the filing for such preceding
insolvency bankruptcy proceeding. In particular:

#### • pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the
payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by
any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or
with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten
days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency
receiver;

#### • pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are
subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if
they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments;

#### • pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial
collateral arrangements, as amended, notwithstanding the suspect period as referred to in
articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial collateral
arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming
into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement
is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and
other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such
proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not
reasonably be aware of it; and

#### • in the case of bankruptcy, article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167
of the Civil Code (action paulienne) gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by the guarantee issued by the
Parent Guarantor or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a Luxembourg entity. If
they are challenged successfully, the guarantees issued by the Parent Guarantor may become unenforceable and
any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of
contracts except for _intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its_
solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency
receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on
any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate.

Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s
business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Issuer or
Luxembourg Guarantor, as applicable).

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings
may be subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/848, as amended of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings, as applicable.

_Switzerland_

Salt is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland and, in the event of its insolvency, insolvency proceedings may
be initiated in Switzerland. The insolvency laws of Switzerland may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Switzerland. In the event that Salt or
its Swiss subsidiary experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction
or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Under Swiss law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be
opened against an entity having its registered office or assets in Switzerland.

In the event of a Swiss entity’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would be governed by Swiss
law as a result of such Swiss entity’s offices being registered in the competent commercial register in Switzerland.
In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security
interests over assets of a foreign entity located in Switzerland. The enforcement of claims and questions relating
to insolvency and bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and
Bankruptcy, as amended from time to time. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can
lead to the opening of bankruptcy (Konkurs) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets, even if located outside
Switzerland, and liabilities of the debtor. However, with regard to assets located outside Switzerland, a Swiss
bankruptcy decree is enforceable only if it is recognized at the place where such assets are located. If bankruptcy
has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special enforcement proceeding limited to the
liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed on a private
liquidation.

However, if bankruptcy is declared while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases
and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no
longer permitted.

As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt enforcement
procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons by local debt enforcement authorities
(Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior
proceedings if the following requirements are met: (i) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors
or the auditors of the company (in case of failure of the board of directors) declare that the debtor is overindebted
(überschuldet) within the meaning of art. 725b of the Swiss Code of Obligations (or the corresponding provision
of the Swiss Code of Obligations in case of a limited liability company (GmbH)) or if it declares to be insolvent
(zahlungsunfähig), and (ii) at the request of a creditor, if the debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of its
creditors or ceases to make payments (Zahlungseinstellung) or if certain events happen during composition
proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in
bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung) which will draw up an inventory of the assets and, further to a creditors’ call for
the filing of claims, establish a schedule of claims (Kollokationsplan).

All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently form the
bankrupt estate which, after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, is used to satisfy the creditors.
However, in respect of assets located abroad, the Swiss authorities do not have jurisdiction to collect such assets
for the purpose of including them in the Swiss bankruptcy estate of the debtor. It is therefore the foreign law
applicable at the place where the assets are located abroad, or treaties between Switzerland and the state in which
such assets are located, that will determine whether and to what extent the foreign authorities can assist in the
collection of these assets. Assets of the bankrupt estate over which a pledge was created in favor of a creditor
before the declaration of bankruptcy are included in the bankrupt estate. The pledgee is under an obligation to
remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate. The assets are liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy in the same
manner as the other assets of the bankrupt estate, but the creditor secured by the pledge retains its privilege to be
satisfied from the proceeds of the liquidation of the assets pledged to it with priority over the unsecured creditors.
Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The first and the second
class, which are privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident insurance, pension plans,
family law and claims for deposits under the Swiss banking act. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the
government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors are treated equally
in the third class. A secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral.

If the enforcement proceeds are not sufficient to fully satisfy the secured claims, the remainder of the claims have
equal rank as unsecured claims with all other unsecured and (provided it is not a privileged claim) non-prioritized
claims. If several pledges secure the same claim, the amount realized is applied proportionally to the claim.


-----

Any creditor wishing to contest the schedule of claims because his claim has been entirely or partially rejected by
the receiver in bankruptcy or not allocated in the rank requested must bring an action against the estate before the
competent court. If any creditor wishes to contest the admission of another creditor to the schedule of claims or
the allocated rank, he must bring an action against such creditor. Such court proceedings could cause holders of
notes to recover less than the principal amount of their notes or less than they could recover in a United States
liquidation. Such proceedings could also cause payment to the holders of the Notes to be delayed, as compared
with holders of undisputed claims.

Claims assigned for security purposes by a Swiss entity that came into existence prior to the opening of bankruptcy
can be enforced by the assignee outside Swiss bankruptcy proceedings, subject to potential avoidance actions.
According to the current jurisprudence of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, assigned claims that come into
existence after the opening of bankruptcy over a Swiss entity or similar insolvency proceedings that lead to the
loss of the capacity of the relevant assignor to dispose of such rights or claims may generally not be enforceable
by the secured creditor.

The Guarantee by the Swiss guarantor (the “Swiss Guarantee”) is, based on a choice of law, subject to the laws
of New York. Should a Swiss court accept jurisdiction in proceedings on the merits, a Swiss court will generally
recognize the choice of law. The scope of such choice of law is, usually, limited to the rules of the substantive law
chosen by the parties; as to procedural matters, a Swiss court will apply Swiss procedural law. Due to the different
nature of Swiss procedural law and the procedural law in common law jurisdictions (such as the United States of
America and the United Kingdom) classification and delimitation issues between substantive and procedural law
could occur. To establish the non-Swiss substantive law applicable to the merits, a Swiss court may, in pecuniary
matters, request the parties to establish the non-Swiss substantive law; Swiss law will be applied, if the content of
the foreign substantive law cannot be established. While a Swiss court will generally accept a choice of law,
restrictively applied exceptions exist: Swiss courts may diverge from the chosen substantive law if such chosen
law would lead to a result contrary to Swiss public policy, if the purpose of mandatory rules of Swiss law require,
by their special aim, immediate application, or if the purpose of mandatory rules of another law, to which the
dispute is closely connected, are considered legitimate under Swiss legal concepts and, upon weighing the interests
of the parties involved, the clearly predominant interest(s) of one party so require.

Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors.
Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a stay (Nachlassstundung) pending
negotiation of the composition agreement with the creditors and confirmation of such agreement by the competent
court. A distinction is made between a composition agreement providing for the assignment of assets
(Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) which leads to a private liquidation and in many instances has
analogous effects as a bankruptcy, and a dividend composition (Dividenden-Vergleich) providing for the payment
of a certain percentage on the creditors’ claims and the continuation of the debtor. Further, there is the possibility
of a composition in the form of a mere payment term extension (Stundungsvergleich). During a moratorium, debt
collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending proceedings are stayed. An assignment of claims for
security purposes entered into by a Swiss entity prior to the granting of a moratorium is ineffective if the assigned
claims come into existence only after the granting of a moratorium. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose
of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed
with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor
participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does
not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due
upon adjudication). The moratorium aims at facilitating the conclusion of one of the above composition
agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent
court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby
secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be
insufficient to cover the secured claims.

Upon the request of the foreign insolvency administrator, the debtor or a creditor, a foreign bankruptcy decree
may be recognized in Switzerland only, provided that (i) the bankruptcy decree is enforceable in the country where
it was issued, (ii) its recognition is, inter alia, not against Swiss public policy, and (iii) the decree was issued (a) in
the state of the debtor’s domicile or (b) in the state where the center of the debtor’s main interests are located,
provided that the debtor was not domiciled in Switzerland when the foreign bankruptcy proceedings were initiated.

**_The Swiss collateral is subject to hardening periods and the Swiss Guarantee is subject to fraudulent transfer_**
**_(avoidance actions)._**

Certain arrangements or dispositions that are made during a certain period (the “suspect period”) preceding the
declaration of bankruptcy or the grant of a moratorium in connection with a composition proceeding may be


-----

challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung) and certain creditors under the applicable rules of
avoidance. The avoidance may relate to (i) gifts and gratuitous transactions made in the suspect period of twelve
months prior to being declared bankrupt or the grant of a moratorium, (ii) certain acts of a debtor (e.g., repayment
of a debt which has not yet fallen due, settlement of a debt by unusual means of payment, granting of a collateral
for previously unsecured liabilities without previously being obliged to do so) in the suspect period of twelve
months prior to being declared bankrupt or the grant of a moratorium if the debtor at that time was over-indebted,
and (iii) dispositions made by the debtor within a suspect period of five years prior to being declared bankrupt or
the grant of a moratorium with the intent, identifiable by the other party, to disadvantage its creditors or to prefer
certain of its creditors to the detriment of other creditors. In case of an avoidance action regarding a disposition in
favor of an affiliated person, including a group company, the favored person bears the burden of proof that the
intent of disadvantaging the creditors was not identifiable.

In case of successful avoidance, the relevant creditors (such as holders of the Notes) are under an obligation to
repay the amounts received. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by
a Swiss security provider’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a
Swiss security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the Guarantee or in
connection with security interests under the Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts
received by the holders of the Notes under a guarantee or security interest that is avoided must be refunded by the
holders of the Notes to the insolvent estate. The holders of the Notes who have restituted the avoided amount paid
to them regain their original claim against the Swiss security provider and are entitled to list their claim in the
schedule of claims in their respective rank and priority. The Swiss principles on avoidance may therefore limit
the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover payments due on the guarantees or security interests.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of_**
**_control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain_**
**_important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer would be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the
date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we
cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient
funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, including the Notes, or that the
restrictions in our Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Remaining Indentures, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A change of control may result in our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Euro 2027
Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured
Notes and other indebtedness being mandatorily prepaid and cancelled and may result in an event of default under,
or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a
default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive
cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change
of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay an equal amount of debt under
our Existing Revolving Credit Facility if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient
funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change
of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the
Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect
that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.
We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the respective Notes would constitute a default under the Existing
Remaining Indentures and the Indenture, as applicable, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.”_

The change of control provision contained in the Existing Remaining Indentures and the Indenture may not
necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization,
restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not
constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Existing Remaining Indentures or the Indenture. Except as


-----

described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Existing Remaining Indentures and the
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred on one occasion if the acquiror operates a
permitted business and a certain consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded as a result of such event that
constitutes a Specified Change of Control Event (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—
_Specified Change of Control Event”). See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Existing Remaining Indentures and the Indenture include a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to
any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the respective Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer
to repurchase the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

#### • the liquidity of any market in the Notes; 

 • your ability to sell your Notes; or 

 • the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. 

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar
to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market
for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is
possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative
effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is
no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you
may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although application will be made to the Authority for the Notes to be provisionally admitted to trading and listed
on the Exchange and for permission to deal in the Notes, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or
remain listed. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the provisional
admission to trading and the listing on the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes,
as applicable, from the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the
secondary market.

In addition, the Existing Remaining Indentures and the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the
future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in Swiss franc. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than Swiss franc, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the
currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political
and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the Swiss franc against the currency by reference
to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.


-----

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be
given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered
or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financing and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in exchange for bookentry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will not be
considered owners or holders of Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect
of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to the relevant paying agent, which will make
payments to SIX SIS. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After
payment to SIX SIS, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you
must rely on the procedures of SIX SIS, and if you are not a participant in SIX SIS, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes
under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from SIX SIS, or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented
for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through SIX SIS. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through SIX SIS will be
adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**Risks Related to Our Ownership**

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may conflict with your interests._**

The interests of our principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of
the Notes. We are controlled by NJJ, the private holding company of entrepreneur and telecommunications
investor Xavier Niel. See “Principal Shareholder.” NJJ may appoint a majority of our Board of Directors and
determine our corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, NJJ has control over our decisions to
enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of
shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best
interests. For example, our shareholder could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain
material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Existing Remaining Indentures, the Indenture, the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional
indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to
generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes. In addition, the interests of our
principal shareholder in other companies in which he owns a majority interest, such as Iliad, may also conflict
with his interests in NJJ and the company. So long as companies controlled by NJJ collectively continue to own
a significant amount of our capital stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, NJJ will continue to be able to
strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. The interests of NJJ may not coincide with your interests.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds with respect to the Refinancing are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including currency exchange
rates and differences from our estimates of fees and expenses.

The gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby is expected to be CHF 100.0 million. We intend to
use the gross proceeds from this Offering, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem in part, on or after
September 15, 2023 and in any event on or prior to September 15, 2024, our Existing 2024 Euro Senior Secured
Notes and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the Offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering outside of Switzerland (as opposed to a harmful “use of
proceeds in Switzerland” as interpreted by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration for purposes of Swiss
Withholding Tax). See “Taxation—Swiss Tax Considerations—Swiss Withholding Tax” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Payments of interest in respect of the Notes could become subject to_
_Swiss Withholding Taxes.”_

____________________________

(1) On March 27 and 29, 2023, we repurchased EUR 1.2 million principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2024 and EUR 0.3
million principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2027 for a total consideration of CHF 1.5 million. On April 5, 11, 12 and
19, 2023, we repurchased EUR 2.3 million principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2024 and EUR 13.7 million principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2027 for a total consideration of CHF 15.9 million. Considerations were paid in the second
quarter of 2023 and are reflected in the above table as a decrease in as adjusted cash and cash equivalents.

(2) For presentational purposes, the principal amount of each of the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Facility B has been converted at
an exchange rate of CHF 0.9978 to €1.00, which represents the exchange rate in effect as of March 31, 2023. This exchange
rate may differ from the exchange rate in effect as of the Issue Date. The principal of the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured
Notes and the principal of the Existing Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes have been adjusted for the repurchase that happened
on April 5, 11, 12 and 19, 2023 for a total consideration of CHF 15.9 million.

(3) The Notes offered hereby will be secured by the same collateral that secures the obligations under the Existing Euro 2027 Senior
Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and the Existing
Senior Facilities.

(4) The Existing Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of CHF 60.0 million. On
the Issue Date, we expect that no amounts will be drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

(5) On December 1, 2019, we entered into an interest-bearing supplier financing agreement with a network supplier and a financial
institution. Under this agreement, we undertook to pay to the financial institution the invoices with an extended deadline greater
than one year. These amounts are considered as financial debt and consequently not recorded as cash capital expenditure in our
statement of cash flows.

(6) Total financial debt excludes derivative liabilities of CHF 104.4 million, accrued interest on debt instruments of CHF 7.6 million
and capitalized transaction costs of CHF 4.7 million.

**THE GROUP**

**History and Development**

We were formed in January 1998 by Orange Overseas Holdings Ltd., VIAG AG and Swissphone Engineering
AG. In the same year, we acquired the third mobile telecommunications license in Switzerland and launched
mobile telecommunications services in June 1999. In 2000, France Telecom (now known as Orange SA) became
the majority shareholder through the acquisition of a 42.5% stake in Orange from E. On (formerly VIAG AG) and
a further 14.75% from other shareholders in 2001. In December 2000, we acquired a Swiss UMTS license.

In 2002, we expanded our operations to Liechtenstein with the acquisition of VIAG Europlatform, which
thereafter became Salt (Liechtenstein) AG. In the same year, FT Group acquired the outstanding shares in Orange,
thereby becoming its sole shareholder.

In 2012, we were acquired by Apax Partners LLP and in February 2015 we were acquired by NJJ Suisse
Acquisition. In April 2015, we rebranded our products and services, which were historically marketed under the
_Orange brand, to our in-house developed brand, Salt._

**Business Operations**

We are one of the three major national telecommunications providers in Switzerland. As part of our mobile
offering, we offer mobile voice, SMS, data and customer care products and services to predominantly postpaid
residential customers, as well as small office/home office (“SoHo”) and medium-sized enterprises (“SME”)
business customers. With our mobile telecommunication offerings, we aim to offer competitive own-branded
products and services that are easy to use, easy to sell and easy to bill and collect. As part of our more recently
introduced home offering, we offer ultra-high-speed internet access, TV, on demand video and fixed telephony
services to home users.

For our mobile offering, we have access to a mobile infrastructure comprised of over 4,300 towers and rooftops.
We offer our home products through our FTTH access network agreements and our Gigabox product, a fixed
wireless access solution (“FWA”). Our FTTH footprint of 1.8 million households, combined with our Gigabox,
allows us to reach approximately 50% of Swiss customers. We expect our FTTH footprint to reach approximately
3.0 million households by 2025, giving us nationwide coverage.


-----

We focus on three key strategic segments, offering services to residential customers (“B2C Mobile”), business
customers (“B2B Mobile”) and ultra-fast broadband for home users (“Home”):

  - B2C Mobile: In B2C Mobile, we offer Salt.-branded packages with mobile voice, SMS and data options
at competitive prices and unlimited high-speed internet in Switzerland offered across all categories as
well as attractive roaming allowances. We also offer Surf. subscriptions, which provide high-speed
internet for tablets and laptops. In addition, we offer a wide range of handsets and hardware from leading
manufacturers made available in a highly customizable and flexible manner as well as customer care
products and services, such as mobile security and device insurance. Our B2C Mobile product offering
also includes offers under GoMo, Das Abo and Lidl connect. In this segment, we offer a unique value
proposition and best-in-class customer service;

  - B2B Mobile: In B2B Mobile, we offer mobile voice, SMS, data and customer care products and services
to our SME and small office and home office (“SoHo”) customers and we aim to increase market
awareness as a B2B operator with our dedicated offers and products, including to large businesses. Our
B2B Mobile offering is focused on simplicity, personalized service and tailored products for our different
customer segments; and

  - Home: In Home, we offer ultra-high-speed internet access, TV, on demand video and fixed telephony
services through our FTTH access network agreements and our differentiated products. Our Fiber Box,
a user-friendly Swiss-designed product, offers a 10 Gbit/s symmetrical bandwidth and an integrated
Apple TV 4K solution at an attractive price-to-value. Our Gigabox offers an alternative to a fiber optic
internet connection using the Salt 5G and 4G+ Mobile Network. Available for residential customers, the
Gigabox solution combines an outdoor 4G and 5G antenna with a new generation router based on the
latest Wi-Fi technology. In 2022, we launched Pro Office, an offer targeting SoHo customers. Pro Office
provides internet/fixed-network featuring ultra-fast 10 Gbps technology and five-fixed network numbers
with unlimited calls to Swiss fixed and mobile networks at an attractive price-to-value. With this new
offer, which can be combined with Pro Mobile subscriptions, we have expanded our Home offering
towards small businesses and are able to provide SoHo customers with converged offers.

Our dedication to providing high quality, world-class competitive services and products to our customers has been
recognized by a number of media outlets. Our services as well as our fixed and mobile networks are repeatedly
awarded: very good mobile network (connect, 2023), best performing internet connection for five consecutive
years (nPerf, 2022), best broadband tariff (SIQT 2022), number one broadband proposition in customer
satisfaction (connect, 2023), best universal provider for SME and residential customers (Bilanz, 2022) and number
one B-to-B mobile provider (SIQT, 2022).

We distribute our products and services in Switzerland directly through our network of 107 Salt.-branded shops,
online and via telesales. We also distribute our products and services indirectly through more than 800 points of
sale in our partners’ distribution channels, such as Mobilezone, and through wholesale resellers, such as Swiss
Post and Lidl.

We provide mobile services primarily through our own mobile 3G, 4G and 5G telecommunications access
network throughout Switzerland and Liechtenstein (through our subsidiary Salt (Liechtenstein) AG). As of June
30, 2023, our 4G and 5G network population coverage was approximately 99.8% and 54.4% in outdoor data
coverage and 91.8% and 21.7% in indoor data coverage, with download speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s. In addition to
our mobile telecommunications access network, we have a transmission network that includes a mobile backhaul
network, a national transmission backbone network (core transport network) and an IT/corporate data network,
comprised of owned and leased equipment. As a consequence of our agreement to acquire indefeasible rights of
use (“IRUs”) for a mobile backhauling fiber, allowing us to connect certain of our antenna sites and providing a
backbone network, the amount of backhauling links we lease has decreased as we have migrated to a “dark fiber”
network.

Our available FTTH footprint is 1.8 million households. We have built our FTTH footprint by entering into 20year IRU contracts with Swisscom, Swiss Fibre Net AG and other local utilities, benefitting from long-term
payment terms. In 2021, we entered into a fiber agreement with Swisscom (the “Swisscom Agreement”) in relation
to Swisscom’s P2MP FTTH network project. In early 2023, Swisscom informed the market that it had decided to
shift its FTTH roll out to a Point-to-Point (“P2P”) topology. Swisscom roll out targets for 2025 remained
unchanged at 55% to 60% coverage and were extended to target 70% to 80% coverage by 2030. After the
announcement, we successfully amended our fiber agreement securing access to any Swisscom roll out in a P2P
topology. We believe that the Swisscom Agreement will enable us to expand our FTTH footprint to cover up to
3.0 million households in Switzerland by 2025 and 4.0 million by 2030 realizing our ambition to become a


-----

nationwide full-fledged telecommunications provider in an effective and cost-efficient way. Compared to
traditional IRU agreements (as used in other jurisdictions), the IRU agreements we entered into are success-based
in nature, limiting upfront cash investments and enabling us to generate better economics compared to a traditional
IRU model, with each IRU delivering on average a positive cash flow from the second month onwards (the first
month being impacted by acquisition and set up costs).

Under NJJ ownership, we have streamlined our management structure and created a lean and efficient organization
with a more engaged workforce, and with a strong focus on strict cost and capital expenditure discipline. Drawing
on NJJ’s extensive experience in the telecommunications business from managing portfolio companies, we have
undertaken an internalization of our network operation, management and maintenance functions, which we,
together with NJJ’s expertise centers and companies in France, now manage and maintain our own network and
IT systems. We believe the internalization of these key operational functions positions us to achieve our network
deployment and upgrade targets at a lower cost, with the aim of offering best-in-class price-to-value ratio for
consumers and delivering strong cash flow generation.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, free
cash flow was CHF 227.3 million, CHF 207.2 million, CHF 186.0 million and CHF 22.3 million, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 our cash
conversion was 62.2%, 65.4%, 62.6% and 48.4%, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, we
generated revenue of CHF 993.3 million, CHF 1,043.6 million, CHF 1,073.3 million and CHF 270.7 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of CHF 507.8 million, CHF 540.8 million, CHF 551.5 million and CHF 135.7 million,
respectively. The table below shows the split between our services revenue and equipment revenue and other
revenue for each of the periods indicated.

**_Our Strategic Segments_**

We focus on three key strategic segments, offering services to B2C Mobile, B2B Mobile and Home customers.
In all our segments, we aim to provide our customers with the best-priced offer in the premium segment.

The year ended 2022 was a record year for Salt with a strong performance in all segments, a significant increase
in the customer base and financial results outpacing the market. We recorded the highest number of net adds in
postpaid mobile in ten years, with a strong momentum in both B2C and B2B, and ranked first in broadband
subscriber growth. Our aim remains to grow faster than the market in the coming years. We believe that we can
achieve this by continuing to offer high-quality products at attractive prices to our customers.

_B2C Mobile_

In B2C Mobile, we offer mobile voice and SMS, data and customer care products and services to our B2C
customers. We believe our offers in the B2C Mobile segments are transparent, simple to understand for our
customers and include innovative products and tariffs. Our postpaid product offering includes five Salt.-branded
offerings with voice, SMS and data options at competitive prices. We also offer Surf. subscriptions, which provide
high-speed internet for tablets and laptops.

Our B2C Mobile offerings together accounted for 58.5%, 56.5%, 55.5% and 54.3% of our total revenue for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023. A majority of
our B2C Mobile postpaid subscribers have entered into 24-month contracts.

Postpaid Offerings

Our key postpaid offerings to customers are our _Salt. Max subscriptions. Our_ _Salt._ _Max subscriptions allow_
customers to choose their monthly rates for calls, SMS, MMS and mobile internet, and allow customers to pay
for new mobile phones through monthly payments. We provide unlimited data volumes in Switzerland from Salt.


-----

_Swiss Max offering, and unlimited data volumes depending on the zone and subscription through Salt. Europe_
_Max and Salt. Travel Max offerings._

Our Salt. Digital subscriptions are comprised of our Swiss 10GB, Smart, Swiss XXL, Europe Data and Europe
_XXL offerings._

Our Salt. Swiss price plans in the Salt. Max and Salt. Digital categories (SIM only and with device bundles) focus
on customers who do not require international phone services on a regular basis. Our Salt. Swiss subscriptions
have an unlimited data allowance in Switzerland (excluding the Salt. Swiss 10 GB and Salt. Start Max offerings).

Our Surf. product provides for 4G+ and 5G high-speed internet access for tablets and laptops.

**MVNOs**

MVNOs are companies that provide mobile services without having their own licensed frequency allocation of
radio spectrum and/or owning their own nationwide mobile network infrastructure through bilateral agreements
with MNOs. MVNO customers are not counted as part of our subscriber base. As of June 30, 2023, we have a
number of live MVNO agreements in our network, including Nexphone, Mtel, Lyca mobile, and additional
agreements under deployment.

Under the MVNO agreements, the MVNO partner provides mobile services without having its own licensed
frequency allocation of radio spectrum and owning its nationwide mobile network infrastructure, through the
agreement with Salt. The MVNO partner then enters into contracts directly with its customers and offers services
solely under its own brand. Salt is the exclusive provider of each MVNO partner for the mobile network (RAN).


-----

**Wholesale Resellers**

Like MVNOs, wholesale resellers rely on an MNO to provide their customers with access to frequency allocation
and network infrastructure. Unlike MVNOs, wholesale resellers do not enter into contracts with their customers.
The MNO directly enters into a contractual arrangement with the customers of the reseller.

We offer flat-rate services through our distribution partner, Swiss Post, the national postal company. We have in
place a non-exclusive agency agreement with Swiss Post, since July 19, 2016, when we launched our brand Das
Abo, initially exclusively sold at Swiss Post offices. Under this contract, Swiss Post is entitled to enter into
customer contracts on our behalf. The agreement has an indefinite duration. Das Abo has since been completely
rebranded and, in 2020, we opened an online channel for Das Abo. We are currently negotiating an exclusive
agreement with Swiss Post, pursuant to which, commencing in 2024, all mobile products distributed by Swiss
Post would be based on the Salt partnership.

As part of our multi-brand strategy, we have further entered into a number of reseller agreements under which our
partners may resell our products and services as part of their offering to business customers, and may do so in the
future. These agreements aim at strengthening our second brand portfolio to address the budget segment and
reposition the Salt brand in the premium segment. These reseller agreements include the reseller agreement in
place with Lidl, under which we sell prepaid and postpaid products and services on a co-branded basis. Lidl is
among the largest retail trade groups in Switzerland. In exchange for its reseller activities, Lidl is entitled to a
revenue share and/or an activation commission, depending on the product and the activation channel. Under our
agreements with Lidl, Lidl is subject to exclusivity provisions. Lidl is prohibited from entering into agreements
for similar services with other mobile service providers under the Lidl brand or any Lidl third-party brand during
the duration of the agreement.

We offer our subscribers a broad selection of handsets, tablets laptops, televisions and entertainment hardware
and related accessories, which we source from a number of well-known suppliers, including Apple, Samsung,
Oppo, Sony and Huawei. The mobile devices and accessories are bundled with mobile tariffs in order to maximize
attachment rates.

Our customers can choose between the traditional upfront payment of the retail handset price, or spread the cost
over 24 months, affording our customers greater flexibility in paying for their handset. Depending on the
customer’s credit, we may increase or decrease the down payment required for purchasing a device. As part of
our strategy, we primarily focus on SIM card only contracts, which lowers our subscriber acquisition costs and
simplifies our billing, collection and inventory processes.


-----

We provide handset subsidies as a marketing strategy to grow our mobile subscriber base and reduce churn. The
amount of the subsidy depends on the applied price plan that is combined with the handset and the length of the
contract.

**International Roaming**

We offer our subscribers international roaming through bilateral agreements with telecommunication operators
outside of Switzerland.

**Additional Products and Services Offered**

Our offering of products and services includes Care, a portfolio of insurance and handset repair services, as well
as mobile Security. We also provide Internet Europe., Internet Travel. Internet Rest of World. and Internet FAR.
roaming options, as add-ons to our lower tier plans, offering our customers uniform tariffs for data while abroad
at Swiss national rates. We also offer entertainment subscription packages including, Zattoo and Canal+ Family.

_B2B Mobile_

In B2B Mobile, we offer mobile voice and SMS, data and customer care products and services to our B2B
customers, and in particular SoHo and SME customers. In this segment, we aim to increase awareness of Salt as
a B2B operator and we believe we have significant market share opportunity growth, as we are experiencing a
continuous and strong growth momentum in this segment. We believe we offer to our B2B Mobile customers a
product portfolio tailored to our customers’ needs, due to our simple operating model and proximity to our
customers.

B2B Mobile revenue represented 4.8%, 4.6%, 4.5% and 4.5% of our total revenue for the years ended December
31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and for three months ended March 31, 2023, respectively.

Our products provide flexibility allowing business customers to choose a package that fits their needs.
Additionally, all-zone cost control features and free Wi-Fi calling abroad allows customers to control their
spending on mobile services.

We offer ultra-high-speed internet access, TV, on demand video and fixed telephony services through our FTTH
access network agreements. Our Fiber Box, a user-friendly Swiss-designed product, offers a 10 Gbit/s
symmetrical bandwidth and an Apple TV 4K, at an attractive price-to-value. Our Gigabox, a fixed wireless access
solution, offers an alternative to a fiber optic internet connection using the Salt 5G and 4G+ Mobile Network.
Available for residential customers in Switzerland, the Gigabox solution combines an outdoor 4G and 5G antenna
with a new generation router with the latest Wi-Fi technology.

With the entry in the fixed line telecommunication market, we established Salt as a fully convergent
telecommunications operator. Our currently available FTTH footprint is 1.8 million households, which, combined
with our Gigabox product, allows us to reach approximately 50% of Swiss customers. Our FTTH footprint is
expected to reach approximately 3.0 million households by 2025, giving us nationwide coverage, as a result of
the long-term partnership with Swisscom announced in April 2021.

As ranked by the 2022 nPerf Awards, we offer the best internet performance for the fifth consecutive year since
launch. We are also the world’s first operator to offer Apple TV 4K based integrated TV platform. Furthermore,

____________________________

We believe that fixed mobile convergence and fiber roll-out will drive the next phase of customer growth, and
that our long-term FTTH access agreements give us ownership-like economics without the risky upfront capital
investments.

**Pricing Strategy**

Our pricing strategy is driven by our broader strategy to offer high-quality and innovative products at attractive
prices to our customers as well as considerations in respect of the pricing of the offering of our competitors and
the costs of running our business. From time to time, we decrease and increase the prices of our offerings based
on our best assessment of the optimal pricing of our offerings in the market for our business.

**Marketing**

Our marketing team employs a multi-channel approach to advertise our mobile and Home products, with a focus
in stores, telesales and online. As part of the broader transformation of the Group under NJJ ownership, we insourced most of our creative campaign planning, copywriting and translation functions. In connection therewith,
we have also consolidated our use of advertising agencies and partners from 41 agencies and partners to five
agencies and partners.

We have also invested in new technologies, continued strengthening online channels and created a new presence
with concise and unique appearance, which reflects on our corporate values and establishes what we believe is a
unique brand image. We believe we have a lean set-up for implementation, with no large scale productions
required, in line with the fast pace of our business. We believe that this agile and efficient marketing structure
enables a constant optimization of our communication.

**Sales and Distribution**

We distribute our products and services both directly and indirectly through partners. We believe we have multiple
channels for customer touchpoints. While we intend to optimize and further develop our own direct distribution
channels to maintain our market presence, enhance customer experiences and manage subscriber acquisition and
retention costs, we are also expanding our indirect distribution channels.

Our direct distribution channels are comprised of online and telesales and a total network of 107 Salt.-branded
shops as of June 30, 2023, many of which are located at attractive locations and in shopping centers, train stations
and airports allowing more flexible opening hours than are common in Switzerland and which attract a larger
number of customers. We also distribute our products directly through the internet and telesales. Our direct
distribution channels (shops, online and telesales) account for the majority of total new contracts signed with our
_Salt.-branded offers (excluding specific partner offers). Relying on direct distribution channels and dedicated_
online offers are key factors for managing subscriber acquisition and retention costs.

Our indirect distribution channel includes partners who sell our products and services through more than 800
points of sale, including Swiss Post, Mobilezone, Lidl and smaller local retailers as of June 30, 2023. Indirect
distributors are commissioned on each retained subscriber and new contracts signed. Wholesale resellers on our
network generally distribute mobile telecommunication services under their own brand and through their own


-----

distribution network and channels. In 2020, for example, we launched Lidl MyAccount which focuses on services
rather than pure sales and which helped increasing retention sales and we expect to launch in the coming quarters
a new version of MyAccount Salt and Lidl eShop, which will include new features and functionalities to enhance
users’ experience.

**Customer Service and Retention**

We provide customer care services, including commercial and technical support, mainly through our contact
centers, online self-care functionalities, and in our Salt shops.

In particular:

#### • We operate four contact centers, two in-house and two through our long-lasting outsourcing
partner, Teleperformance. This organization allows insourcing of core activities and successful
benchmarking to maximize the delivery of service quality to our customers and sales
performance.

#### • In our contact centers, we have, among other things, implemented a skill-based routing of
customer requests in order to optimize the quality and speed of handling, as well as an
interactive voice response system which provides the most relevant and customized information
to deflect calls distributed to agents.

#### • Thanks to a continuous improvement program we could significantly reduce the propensity-tocall of our customer base and improve the first contact resolution. We plan to continue working
on Customer Experience through many initiatives already in the pipe.

#### • On March 30, 2021, the German magazine “Connect” published its yearly service hotline
ranking for mobile telecommunication providers in the DACH region and Salt was ranked first
among all operators in the region. The evaluation was based on availability, waiting time,
friendliness and the quality of advice and counselling provided. Whereas on the service hotline
ranking for fix providers tested by “Connect,” Salt was ranked number one in Switzerland for
four years in a row, since the 1st edition in 2018. Furthermore, we were rated by connect best
in customer satisfaction in the DACH region in 2023 ranking first in the four subcategories
tested, among others customer service.

#### • Our customers can access a broad range of digital self-care functionalities with their computer
or mobile phone. Most of our customer care services are made available directly to our
customers through several self-care options. We also offer a community chat, including a bot,
as an efficient complementary channel to answer customers’ enquiries.

#### • We provide customer services in our own shops, where we aim to maximize customer
satisfaction through a sales training team which organizes product and sales training for new
hires, advanced sales training as well as leadership training for our front-line employees.
Through follow-up coaching, we offer best practices sharing systems between the different
shops and by incentivizing our employees through their career path, among other things.

#### • Our Care option is a further key element of our customer services providing insurance and
express repair services.

**Network and Infrastructure**

**_Mobile Access Network_**

We offer mobile services through our 3G UMTS/HSPA, 4G LTE and 5G mobile access network comprising
approximately 4,163 base stations equipped with 3G technologies (UMTS/HSPA), 4,209 base stations equipped
with 4G technologies (LTE), 1,220 base stations equipped with 5G technologies and 559 additional base stations
equipped with 5G+ technologies at 4,341 antenna sites as of December 31, 2022. Our number of mobile sites
increased from 4,277 as of December 31, 2020 to 4,341 as of December 31, 2022. In 2020, we retired our 2G
mobile network, which mainly consisted of 1800 MHz antennas and use the bandwidth for 4G.

#### • Our 3G mobile access network currently comprises 900 MHz and 2100 MHz antennas. We
estimate, as of December 31, 2022, our 3G network covered approximately 99.9% of the Swiss
population (outdoor voice coverage).


-----

#### • Our 4G mobile access network currently comprises mainly 1800 MHz antennas, and we are
currently deploying in 800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz. We estimate, as of December 31,
2022, our 4G network covered approximately 99.8% of the Swiss population (outdoor data
coverage).

#### • Our 5G mobile access network currently comprises mainly 700 MHz antennas. We estimate, as
of December 31, 2022, our 5G network covered approximately 43.6% of the Swiss population
(outdoor data coverage).

#### • Our 5G+ mobile access network currently comprises mainly 3500 MHz antennas. We estimate,
as of December 31, 2022, our 5G+ network covered approximately 34.3% of the Swiss
population (outdoor data coverage).

As of December 31, 2022, our outdoor population coverage for 4G+ and 4G macro sites were, respectively, 96.7%
(92.6% in 2020 and 54% in 2018), 99,8% (99.3% in 2020 and 98.1% in 2018).

As part of the transformation of the Group under NJJ ownership, we have internalized network and IT
management (from the design up to the operations) at Salt, and NJJ owned companies such as IT Solutions Factory
and Network Solutions Factory. In addition to our change in strategy, we benefit from our relationship with other
NJJ companies including IT systems companies owned by our principal shareholder and provider of software
development services. We have also terminated our maintenance services with third parties where possible and
enhanced our in-house maintenance capabilities.

In 2022, Salt improved its results by 15 points to 945 points, while its competitors’ results decreased. At 945
points, Salt has improved its score by 100 points over the last five years and reached its highest score ever. The
29[th] edition of the connection mobile network test demonstrates that Switzerland enjoys an excellent network
service quality: the disparities between the three Swiss mobile networks are incredibly small with an overall score
difference of about +/- 2% between operators.

**_IRU Lines_**

We have P2P partnership agreements with Swiss Fibre Net AG, local utilities and Swisscom, which give us access
to approximately 1.8 million Swiss households granting access to broadly the entire existing FTTH footprint. In
addition, in April 2021 we entered into the Swisscom Agreement, which will give us access to approximately
three million homes in 2025.

In these P2P agreements, we have entered into 20-year indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”) contracts, giving us long
term visibility on payment terms. The IRU model allows for superior FTTH unitary economics, where each line
is self-financed and IRU payments are success based in nature. The IRU lines are fully portable.

IRUs are recognized as assets when the Group has the specific indefeasible right to use an identified portion of
the underlying asset, generally optical fibers or dedicated wavelength bandwidth, and the duration of the right
corresponds to the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset. The instalments paid by the Group for
IRUs are currently spread over more than ten years on average. This average may change in the future depending
on the partnership agreements mix. The related liability is presented as long-lived asset payables with a current
and a non-current portion. In the future, we expect some IRUs to be accounted for as finance leases. As of March
31, 2023, operating IRUs payables amounted to CHF 472.7 million. IRUs payables are excluded from our total
financial debt. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—Our substantial leverage and debt
_service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect_
_to the Notes and the Guarantees.”_

**_Transmission and Transport Network_**

Our mobile transmission and transport network comprises a backhaul network (microwaves and fiber lines),
metro-rings, and a national backbone network (core transport network), as well as an IT data network. Historically,
we have leased backhauling lines. In addition, we have already backhauled over fiber the majority of the network.

As a consequence of our agreement to acquire IRUs for a mobile backhauling fiber to connect certain of our
antenna sites and for a backbone network from the beginning of 2017, the amount of fiber network we lease has
been decreasing over the years as we migrate to a “dark fiber” network. For additional information, see “—Certain
_Contracts Relating to the Operation of Our Business—Agreement for Mobile Backhauling Fiber and Backbone_
_Network.”_

We expect to increase the number of our antennas backhauled over fiber as fiber footprint is deployed.


-----

**IT Systems**

Our information technology systems are highly integrated into every aspect of our business providing capabilities
for a variety of purposes in relation to customer front-ends, middleware and back-ends and cover, among other
things, the following fundamental areas:

#### • billing, customer relationship management;

 • point-of sales support, commissioning, sales force automation;

 • supply chain management;

 • online services;

 • data warehousing;

 • controlling, finance; and

 • HR.

The systems are mainly hosted in two data centers (in Crissier and an outsourced data center, Interxion, in Zürich).
In 2017, we signed a 15-year contract with Interxion in relation to our new data center in Glattbrugg, which has
replaced our own data center in Zürich in 2021.

We began insourcing our IT systems in the second half of 2015 with an aim to develop in-house software better
tailored to our needs, including by moving our billing processes in-house and purchasing and further customizing
billing software from our previous supplier Qvantel. In February 2018, we completed the migration onto our new
IT Open Source platform (fully developed in-house) including mediation, activation, rating, billing and collection
activities and completed the last major step of the 360° transformation of the Group, with the implementation of
our own operating support system (“OSS”) in 2021. Our OSS has been fully developed and operated in-house.

**Licenses**

We provide mobile internet service mainly through 3G, 4G and 5G. 3G licenses were awarded by the regulator in
2000 (2100 MHz). 4G coverage has been provided since 2013 and 5G coverage is currently being rolled out.

We believe that we hold all necessary licenses to operate our business. We are licensed to provide mobile
telecommunication services in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In Switzerland, our first mobile frequencies license
awarded in the 2012 spectrum auction is due to expire on December 31, 2028. This spectrum license is a
technology neutral license which includes the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum
awarded to us. This license covers the complete spectrum previously allocated to us and replaces the previous
GSM license and the UMTS license. Our second mobile frequencies license in Switzerland awarded in the 5G
spectrum auction in February 2019 is due to expire in April 2034. This spectrum license is a technology neutral
license including 5G-compatible spectrum in the 700 MHz, 1400 MHz and 3.5 GHz bands.

In Liechtenstein, through our subsidiary Salt (Liechtenstein) AG, we were awarded in 2015 a new license in
Liechtenstein, which does not have an expiration date. This spectrum license is a technology neutral license which
includes the 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum awarded to us as well as 700MHz, 1400 MHz
and 3.5 GHz granted to us on January 1, 2023. This new license covers the complete spectrum granted to us and
replaces the previous GSM and UMTS licenses.

We believe we have secured an adequate amount of spectrum, in line with our two main competitors, Sunrise and
Swisscom, to keep developing our network and to address our future needs with respect to new generation
services. In addition, we have obtained two important frequency blocks in the 700 MHz low band. The acquisition
of 700MHz FDD spectrum is important to our low-band spectrum portfolio and furthers our strategy of providing
deeper indoor 5G high-speed coverage to our customers throughout Switzerland. The 3.5 GHz TDD spectrum and
the 1,400 MHz SDL spectrum will be mainly used to deliver next generation mobile broadband with super-fast
speeds and robust, low-latency connectivity for consumers, as well as for the Internet of Things.

**Certain Contracts Relating to the Operation of Our Business**

We are a party to a number of agreements that are important to our business, including those set out below.


-----

**_Long-Term Services Contracts with Cellnex_**

In connection with the Towers Sale, we entered into a long-term master services agreement (the “Cellnex MSA”)
with an affiliate of Cellnex, Swiss Infra, regarding the provision of hosting services by Swiss Infra to Salt over
mobile telecommunications infrastructure as well as the construction of new sites through a build-to-fit and buildto-suit program. Services provided to us pursuant to the Cellnex MSA include, among other things, hosting our
equipment on the passive infrastructure on the sites and any fiber connection services (backhauling), undertaking
upgrade works, and to perform preventive and ongoing maintenance of the passive infrastructure. Swiss Infra also
assumes the underlying lease agreements relating to the sites and is responsible for the renewal of those lease
agreements. The Cellnex MSA also provides for a 1% inflation fixed escalator. Pursuant to the terms of the
Cellnex MSA, we shall pay certain per site and per service fees to Swiss Infra.

_Build-to-Fit program: In addition to existing sites, Swiss Infra will develop and construct new sites as requested_
by us. Swiss Infra will propose to us (and if accepted by us, construct) a certain minimum number of “build-to-fit
sites” per year, adhering to our specifications and construction standards.

_Build-to-Suit program: Furthermore, we are required to propose to Swiss Infra a certain number of sites in the_
eight-year period following completion of the transfer of mobile telecommunications infrastructure to Swiss Infra,
which was on August 5, 2019. Until the earlier of the date on which the minimum number of build-to-suit sites
has been constructed by us and sold to Swiss Infra or June 30, 2027, Swiss Infra agrees to purchase such built-tosuit sites for a price defined in the Cellnex MSA. In particular, we have committed to build a certain number of
sites to support our rollout program in the coming years.

Given the uncertainty regarding the magnitude and the temporality of the incurrence of those capital expenditure,
the amount of the commitment could not be accurately quantified, and is not reflected in the total outstanding
investment commitments, with a payment schedule spread over a number of years, of CHF 134.1 million as at
March 31, 2023.

The Cellnex MSA has an initial term of 20 years from August 5, 2019, automatically extended for a further tenyear period and for further periods of ten years from the end of each ten-year period, unless otherwise terminated
in accordance with the terms of the agreement. We may terminate the Cellnex MSA giving 12 months’ prior
written notice at the end of the initial term or any extension thereafter, and Swiss Infra may terminate giving five
years’ prior notice effective at the end of the first ten-year extension period or at the end of each subsequent tenyear extension thereafter.

Concurrently with the Cellnex MSA, we entered into a Transitional Services Agreement with Swiss Infra for the
provision of certain services on a transitional basis following the Towers Sale.

In light of our continuous investment in network coverage and performance, including deployment of 5G, we have
also, under the Cellnex WSA, committed to require certain levels of works and engineering services from Swiss
Infra and have undertaken to pay Swiss Infra for the provision of such services minimum payment obligations
payable in yearly instalments until December 31, 2023 in the aggregate amount of not less than CHF 71 million
(of which CHF 17 million outstanding as of December 31, 2022) (the “Minimum Payment Obligation”). The
payments under the Minimum Payment Obligation correspond to works and engineering services that may be
delivered to us also after December 31, 2023 and until the end of the contract period.

**_Swisscom Agreement and Fixed-line Agreements_**

On April 29, 2021, we entered into a FTTH partnership with Swisscom (the “Swisscom Agreement”), which,
_inter alia, will allow us to expand the footprint of our ultrafast broadband Salt. Home product. The Swisscom_
Agreement became effective on May 1, 2021. Currently, there are approximately 900 fiber distribution hubs
(“FDHs”) in the Swisscom network, broadly proportional to the households covered. In the new FTTH areas, we
are already present in some of the FDHs for mobile backhauling. In 2022, Swisscom has informed the market and
Salt that it has decided to shift its FTTH roll out to a Point-to-Point (“P2P”) topology. The parties have reached
an agreement and amended the fiber partnership, on March 3, 2023, in order to also secure access to any Swisscom
roll out in a P2P topology.

The Swisscom Agreement builds on our existing business relationship with Swisscom, pursuant to which for
several years we have been using physical layer 1 access to Swisscom optical fibers in the point-to-point
architecture (P2P) for our residential customer offerings as well as backhauling optical fibers for connecting our
mobile antennas. In the framework of the Swisscom Agreement, we expect to invest in a long-term right to use
Swisscom’s fiber-optic connections. Swisscom continues to bear overall responsibility for network planning,
network expansion and maintenance, and remains the owner of the infrastructure. The Swisscom Agreement does


-----

not grant exclusivity to either party. The Swisscom Agreement also provides for long-term wholesale order
commitments by us and building commitments by Swisscom.

_ALO lines: Each ALO contingent has a term of 20 years from the date of invoicing by Swisscom. After this_
minimum term of 20 years has expired, we have the right to request a further extension of ten years at an already
agreed price, subject to any future technical restrictions and developments. After the extension has expired, or if
the extension option has not been exercised, the ALO quota contained therein expire automatically. ALO
contingents can be ordered until at least 2040.

_Pricing: The price structure for the ALO contingents is based on fixed prices, that can be renegotiated in good_
faith at the end of the initial 20-year term. Long-term payment terms have yearly interest rates, which can be
updated under certain circumstances. In addition, we have the right, upon prior notice, at any time to immediately
pay or accelerate amortization of any ALO contingents. In this case, future interest will not apply.

We have committed to incur capital expenditure over the next 20 years in connection with the Swisscom
Agreement. Given the uncertainty regarding the magnitude and the temporality of the incurrence of those capital
expenditure, the amount of the commitment could not be accurately quantified, and is not reflected in the total
outstanding investment commitments, with a payment schedule spread over a number of years, of CHF 134.1
million as at March 31, 2023.

In addition to the agreements with Swisscom for the current footprint and the future rollout, we have entered into
fixed line agreements, with Swiss Fibre Net AG, the City of Zürich (ewz), the City of Lausanne (LFO SA), SIG
(Geneva), iwb (Basel) and Swiss4net Holding AG (Pully and Ascona) for the use of their fiber network. We have
also entered into Fiber Storm, a three-party agreement with Sunrise and Swiss Fibre Net AG, to stimulate the use
of FTTH and its integration through the Swiss fiber network.

**_Sourcing of Mobile Handsets, SIM Cards and Accessories_**

We have stand-alone agreements with key suppliers of handsets, SIM cards and accessories, including three main
agreements with Apple, which is our sole vendor for our TV hardware platform (iPhone, iPad and Apple TV),
and agreements with Gemalto, Huawei Technologies, Samsung, Sony Mobile and Wiko. In addition, we have
agreements with Zattoo, which provides our Salt TV app platform, Arcadyan, which is the provider of our previous
Fiber Box, and Sagecom, which is the provider of our new Fiber Box.

**_Wholesale Interconnection Agreements_**

We have entered into separate interconnection agreements with Swisscom and Sunrise regarding the connection
of our network with their respective networks. For international interconnections, we have further entered into a
limited number of interconnection agreements with operators regarding the international connection of our
network with their respective networks.

**_Distribution Agreements_**

We have contractual relations with third-party distributors who sell our products and services. Our agreements
with these distributors follow the model of our standard distribution partner agreement. Depending on the setup
and targeted customer market of the distributor, the standard agreement can be extended by a sales point agreement
and/or B2B partner agreement. Our distribution agreements are usually entered into for an indefinite period and
may be terminated by either party by giving three months’ notice. These contracts contain customary termination
events which do not include a change of control, but, in light of the distribution of Apple products, contain an
extraordinary termination right if we no longer have the agreement with Apple in place.

With regard to warehousing and distribution, we entered into a service agreement for logistics services and an
extension agreement relating to this contract with ALSO Schweiz AG, our main logistics partner. The agreement
has an indefinite term and provides for a six months’ notice period for termination.

**_Interxion Agreement_**

On May 23, 2017, we entered into a services agreement for the rental of and allocation of power to private space
with Interxion (Schweiz AG) for a period of 15 years from July 1, 2017. We may terminate the agreement for
convenience, not earlier than five years from July 1, 2017, upon payment of a contractually agreed fee. We can
extend the agreement for a period of five years. The contract will then automatically renew for successive periods
of one year unless terminated by either party. The agreement is governed by Swiss law.


-----

**_Outsourcing Agreements with Teleperformance_**

On May 1, 2013, we entered into an outsourcing agreement with Teleperformance Portugal and Teleperformance
Athens, regarding the provision of call center services. The agreement contains customary termination events, as
well as termination provisions for a change of control to a competitor and unethical environmental practices.
Negotiations are ongoing to renew the agreement at revised terms.

**_Cooperation Agreement with Sunrise, ewz and Swisscom_**

In September 2013, we entered into a ten-year agreement with UPC Schweiz GmbH (now Sunrise) for the supply
and implementation of 900 1Gbps leased lines replacing low-capacity microwaves and transmission lines at 4G
sites to guarantee seamless data consumption by our customers using LTE. Implementation was completed in
2015. In September 2013, we entered into a cooperation agreement with ewz for the optic fiber connection of an
initial 130 4G antennas in the City of Zürich. The agreement allows us to draw on the experience and expertise of
ewz in the installation and operation of optical fiber connections as we continue to increase the capacity of our
4G network in Zürich. Ewz has installed optical fiber connections, is responsible for their operation and is
providing us with new locations for additional antennas in some cases and “small cells.” By using small cells and
connecting our antennas to the core network using optical fibers, we intend to increase our capacity even further
and to densify the network in very busy locations. In October 2014, we signed a five-year high-capacity leased
lines agreement (1Gbps) replacing low-capacity leased lines with Swisscom. This agreement allows us to secure
on a large scale the high-capacity transmission of our 4G network by ensuring coverage that is geographically
broader and more densely concentrated.

**_Agreement for Mobile Backhauling Fiber and Backbone Network_**

In 2017, we entered into an agreement with Swisscom to acquire indefeasible rights of use for a mobile
backhauling fiber to connect certain of our antenna sites and for a backbone network. As a result of this agreement,
we expect the amount of leased fiber network to decrease.

**_Salt Care Insurance Agreement_**

We offer our customers the option to insure their mobile devices against damage, theft, and fraudulent use under
our “Salt Care” program, which is provided by AXA Versicherungen AG (“AXA”) pursuant to a group insurance
contract between Salt, AXA and i-surance AG (“i-surance”) currently owned by Bolttech Switzerland AG dated
October 27, 2020 (the “Salt Care Insurance Agreement”), whereby as of February 7, 2022, the corporate name of
i-surance has changed to “bolttech Switzerland AG.” Under the Salt Care Insurance Agreement, AXA is the
underwriter of the insurance policy, covering also any legacy insurance product we used to offer in the past, while
i-surance has agreed to provide certain activities such as claim-handling services and other contract-management
services. The Salt Care Insurance Agreement became effective on January 1, 2021 and has been amended in July
2023 providing for a fixed term of four years from January 1, 2021. After the initial term, the Salt Care Insurance
Agreement shall be automatically renewed for a period of two years and after the two-year period, it will be further
renewed on an annual basis, unless terminated by either party. The Salt Care Insurance Agreement provides for
customary termination provisions.

**_Agreement with SpaceX_**

On March 1, 2023, we have entered into an agreement with SpaceX to provide continuous coverage through
satellite technology. This agreement, which is the first of its kind in Europe, leverages SpaceX’s Starlink satellite
constellation to connect Salt’s current and future mobile customers to Starlink satellites, providing them with
enhanced connectivity and coverage.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are subject to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Antenna site disputes are
common issues for mobile telecommunications network operators, including us. We are currently subject to
various legal proceedings related to our antenna sites where the required permits and/or the lease agreements for
antenna sites are under dispute. The number of antenna site disputes has been stable in recent years. However,
due to popular opposition to 5G deployment among certain activist groups, we already see an increase in the
number of administrative appeals filed against the development of our new sites and upgrades. In addition, we are
subject from time to time to audits and investigations, some of which may in the future result in proceedings being
instituted against us. Other than as described below, we are not currently subject to any legal, regulatory or
arbitration proceedings that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.


-----

**Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**

**_Environmental Impact_**

We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose
increasingly stringent environmental obligations regarding, among other things, radiation emissions, zoning, the
protection of employee health and safety, noise, and historical and artistic preservation. We could therefore be
exposed to costs and liabilities, including liabilities associated with past activities. Our operations are subject to
obligations to obtain environmental permits, licenses and/or authorizations, or to provide prior notification to the
appropriate authorities.

Our objective is to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and health control laws, and all
related permit requirements. We believe that the principal environmental risks arising from our current operations
relate to the potential for electromagnetic pollution and for damage to cultural and environmental assets. In
extreme cases, the penalty for repeat violations of the applicable environmental laws in Switzerland could result
in administrative sanction, suspension and even revocation of our license.

We use different network infrastructure strategies to achieve radiation emission ranges lower than the minimum
levels permitted by applicable Swiss regulations. If the Swiss government or regulator were to set limits on
electromagnetic emissions that are stricter than those currently in effect, we could be required to upgrade, move
or make other changes to our mobile telephone infrastructure.

We enacted various guidelines—in particular with regard to the quality of antenna sites and minimization of safety
risks in connection with non-ionizing radiations—as well as a health and safety policy. We have further obtained
ISO 9001:2008 system certifications in connection with the circular of the Swiss Federal Office for the
Environment regarding the quality assurance for compliance with the limits of antenna radiation. We have a yearly
verification audit in connection with this certification, and have most recently passed our ISO recertification audit
in July 2022 in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 requirements without any nonconformities. The next
recertification audit is expected to take place in 2025.

_Our Carbon Footprint_

Our target is to reduce our emissions on Scopes 1 and 2 – i.e., essentially the direct emissions associated with
fossil fuel combustion for mobility and heating, and electricity – and fully offset the remaining emissions on these
Scopes by 2025. Since January 1, 2021, our main offices and in-house data center are supplied with 100%
electricity from renewable sources. In addition, our new Fiber Box has a 21% lower carbon footprint compared
to our first Fiber Box. We are preparing a net zero roadmap in compliance with the Science-Based Targets
initiative and the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Carbon footprint increases by +7’595 tons of CO2 equivalent from 2021 to 2022, mainly due to higher volumes
of devices and accessories sold and the peak of 5G deployment in 2022. The below table describes our carbon
footprint.

Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are measured in accordance with the GHG Protocol standard with the
methodological support and external verification of myclimate, an independent non-profit organization with
extensive expertise in corporate carbon footprints. The calculations are carried out by myclimate based on data
from the ecoinvent database, various external studies and our own data.

_Scope 1 relates to direct emissions from fossil fuel combustion for our car fleet and owned or leased buildings_
(offices, data centers) and refrigerants. The increase in emissions is mainly due to a higher number of cars in
operation (mainly due to the increase of sales employees) and overall higher travel activity post-COVID-19, which
more than offsets further efficiency gains that were made in the year.


-----

_Scope 2 relates to direct emissions from electricity and district heating for our network (mobile base stations,_
access and core networks), offices and data centers.

_Scope 3, representing most of our carbon footprint, covers the indirect emissions related to our operations and_
supply chain, especially the purchased/capitalized goods and services. Rented stores’ electricity and heating
emissions are also categorized under scope 3. The increase in emissions is mainly due to higher volumes of devices
and accessories sold and the peak of 5G deployment in 2022.

_Extending the lifespan of mobile devices_

To reduce waste and in particular e-waste, we offer attractive SIM only deals that enable and incentivize customers
to continue using their perfectly functioning devices. In 2022, SIM only offers represent a large majority of all
offers, and their share in terms of sales more than tripled since 2014.

Mobiles and tablets are key objects of daily life. To protect them and extend their lifespan, we offer our customers
easy access to repair services, either as part of our Care Insurance product or on demand. These services are
available in our stores, remotely via online or care support – and even at several repair partners with our Care
Insurance.

In addition, for all Care Insurances subscribed to since 2021 a contribution is made to planting trees to capture
CO2 and support local community development in Ethiopia, Madagascar, Haiti, Nepal, Indonesia, Mozambique,
Kenya and Central America due to a partnership with the recognized NGO Eden Reforestation Projects.

The respect of ESG requirements for providers in all areas of our work and influence is of utmost importance to
us. Therefore, we require from our providers and their subcontractors to comply with regulations relating to human
rights, environmental protection and ethics. We pay particular attention to the environmental performance of
products and services and we take it into account in business decisions and in the selection of our network
equipment.

**Employees and Pension Obligations**

As of December 31, 2022, our workforce comprised 1,026 FTEs.

The diagram below shows our organizational chart.

We have a representative body for the employees, the Employee Forum. As the representative body, the Employee
Forum ensures the implementation of the Swiss Federal Act on Information and Consultation of Workers in
Business Operations. We have not entered into a collective labor agreement. We have 1,071 employees (excluding
trainees and apprentices) or 1,026 FTEs as of December 31, 2022, thereof 92.3% employed with a permanent
contract.

We provide retirement benefits to our employees as required by Swiss law through a pension fund that is a separate
legal entity. The pension fund is organized as defined contribution scheme (treated as a defined benefit agreement
for the purposes of IFRS) and consists of four pension plans. The first pension plan covers all employees with an
annual salary below 3.5 times the maximum “old age pension”. The second pension plan covers all employees
who are not members of our management with an annual salary equal or above 3.5 times the maximum old age
pension mentioned above. The third pension plan covers all employees with the Director title. The fourth pension
plan covers the members of the management board.

As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Group plan assets amounted to CHF 135.7 million, while the Group
had a defined benefit obligation of CHF 135.7 million. This results in the recognition of no pension liability in the
Group’s condensed statement of financial position.

We believe in fair and equal treatment of all people and we aim on having a diverse and inclusive workforce as
illustrated by the below graphic.


-----

In 2021, Salt conducted an equal pay analysis as required by the Swiss Gender Equality Act. The results showed
that Salt complies with the requirements of the Swiss Gender Equality Act. More specifically, we have 28.5%
female employee ratio, which is above the Swiss industry average (ICT).

We believe that our employee relations are good. We have not experienced any labor-related work stoppages
during the past three years.

**Our Contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)**

As part of our general ESG strategy, we contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals included in United
Nations Agenda 2030. In particular, we contribute to the following goals set out in the below table.


-----

**Property and Leases**

We, together with our subsidiary Salt (Liechtenstein) AG, currently use seven office buildings and 107 of our own
_Salt.-branded shops. We focus on main commercial and flagship areas, including Bern, Zürich and the German-_
speaking regions of Switzerland. We lease six of the seven office buildings, including our headquarters in Renens,
and we entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement with respect to our office/call center in Biel in March 2012.
We own our building in Crissier which measures approximately 3,416 square meters and hosts a switch and data
center. This building is also used as an office and for storage.

We currently own approximately 4,163 3G UMTS/HSPA base stations (node-B) and 4,209 4G LTE base stations
at approximately 4,341 antenna sites. We lease the antenna sites from their respective owners. We use additional
sites, regarding which we entered into joint use or similar agreements with the respective owners of the antenna
sites.

**Intellectual Property**

We control and own all intellectual property related to our brand name.

**Research and Development**

Our research and development projects mainly relate to the upgrade of the network architecture or functionality
and the development of service platforms aimed at offering new services to our customers. For additional
information regarding our research and development projects, see Note 2.8 to our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are sufficient to insure appropriately our risks,
including insurance for third-party liability, property damage/business interruption, director and officer liability,
buildings, construction and erection, special technical equipment and various other insurances.

(a) This adjustment represents the rent cost of the operating leases which are capitalized under IFRS 16.

(7) EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAaL (excluding impact of IFRS 16) and Adjusted EBITDA
margin measures are non-IFRS measures. We define EBITDA as profit attributable to owners before income tax
expenses/(benefit), share of net profit (loss) of associates accounted for using the equity method, finance income, finance
costs, depreciation of right-of-use assets, depreciation and amortization and gain on disposal and other gains. We define
EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenue. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, after excluding corporate and
monitoring fees and restructuring, transition and transaction costs. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted
EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDAaL (excluding impact of IFRS 16)” refers to adjusted EBITDA, excluding
IFRS 16 impact. This information is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures under IFRS.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented here differ from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” contained herein
under “Description of the Notes” and in the Indenture.

Our activities in Switzerland are subject to statutory regulation and supervision by various Swiss national
authorities, in particular ComCom and OFCOM. In addition to ComCom and OFCOM, ComCo, the Swiss Federal
Price Supervisor and FINMA (with respect to certain aspects of anti-money laundering measures) are also
involved in regulatory issues relating to the telecommunications sector. The Federal Commissioner for Data
Protection and Information (Eidgenössischer Datenschutz- und Öffentlichkeitsbeauftragter (the “EDÖB”)) is
responsible for issues concerning data protection and the processing of data. The Post and Telecommunications
Surveillance Service (“PTSS”) is responsible for gathering data from telecommunications service providers if
requested by law enforcement agencies and required for criminal investigations according to the surveillance act
(Bundesgesetz betreffend die Überwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (“BÜPF”)).

The relevant regulatory framework is set forth mainly in the FMG and associated ordinances and regulations (e.g.,
the Swiss Federal Ordinance on Telecommunications Services (Verordnung über Fernmeldedienste or “FDV”)),
and also in the Swiss Cartel Act, the BÜPF and associated ordinance and regulations and some additional
legislation, such as the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Datenschutz (“DSG”)) and
associated ordinance and the Swiss Radio and Television Act (“RTVG”) and associated ordinance. With respect
to certain limited services offered by the Group, the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act (Bundesgesetz über die
_Bekämpfung der Geldwäscherei und der Terrorismusfinanzierung (“GwG”)) and RTVG, its associated ordinances_
and regulatory guidance also apply. Furthermore, we are subject to the UWG and the ordinance on price quotations
(Preisbekanntgabeverordnung (the “PBV”)) with respect to advertising and other market conduct.

While Switzerland is not a member of the European Union and is, therefore, not subject to the EU
telecommunications regulation, the liberalization of the Swiss mobile telecommunications market has moved
largely in parallel with the deregulation of the telecommunications market in the European Union, and it is likely
to further develop in line with developments in the European Union. Notwithstanding, there are some conceptual
differences, the most important being that mobile telecommunication is subject to _ex post_ regulation in
Switzerland as opposed to ex ante regulation in the European Union and the lack of comprehensive regulation on
international roaming in Switzerland, albeit it is understood that general principles of the Swiss Cartel Act apply.

The Swiss mobile telecommunications market was liberalized in 1998, when the FMG came into effect. While
considerable progress was made under the 1998 liberalization regime, some deficiencies were identified, which
led to a partial but important revision of the FMG in 2007. The Swiss Telecommunications Act was revised and
approved by the parliament in March 2019, and the respective ordinances were partially revised and approved by
the parliament in November 2020. The FMG and respective ordinances entered into force on January 1, 2021,
with some transition periods. The BÜPF and the respective ordinance were revised and entered into force in March
2018 with some transition periods. The DSG was partially revised in September 2020. The revised DSG and the
associated ordinance will come into force in September 2023. The main objective of the revision was to align the
Swiss data protection law with the standards of the EU. The revision of the DSG provides for a series of
amendments. For example, the DSG is no longer applicable to data of legal persons and the definition of personal
data requiring special protection has been expanded and now includes data on ethnicity, genetic data and biometric
data that clearly identifies a natural person. Furthermore, the revised DSG contains enhanced information
obligations and provides for a duty to keep a register of all data processing activities.

**Telecommunications Industry Regulation**

**_General_**

The general framework for the transmission of information by means of landline and mobile telecommunication
is set out in the FMG and associated ordinances and regulations. The scope of the regulation of the FMG includes
all legacy landline and mobile voice transmission, narrow and broadband data transmission, as well as the
transmission of television and radio programs (irrespective of the infrastructure used, but subject to overriding
provisions of the RTVG).

According to the FMG, all providers must possess the technical skills and capabilities necessary to offer
telecommunications services, they must comply with the applicable laws and regulations, obey the labor laws and
particular labor conditions in the industry, and offer a reasonable number of apprenticeships. The FMG also sets
forth general rules on resources, including rules regarding fixed line and mobile numbers, a fully liberalized
regime on telecommunications equipment, such as devices, installations, that only regulates technical compliance,
a particular regime on universal services, including financing, confidentiality of the contents of communications,
data protection, and particular obligations of telecommunications providers to protect vital national interests in


-----

certain extraordinary circumstances. The FMG also sets forth general rules on: (i) resources, including rules
regarding landline and mobile numbers; (ii) telecommunications equipment, such as devices and installations;
(iii) universal services, including financing (in practice, Swisscom is the only licensed provider of universal
services), confidentiality of the contents of communications, and data protection; (iv) notification requirements
and licenses; (v) granting of access by dominant providers; and (vi) particular obligations of telecommunications
providers to protect vital national interests in certain extraordinary circumstances.

Chapter 9 of the FMG (Articles 49 to 55) provides certain penalties and the potential withdrawal of licenses for
abuses, such as manipulation and prohibited use of information and for other violations of the law. Any
manipulation or abuse of communicated information or interference with telecommunications may be punished
by imprisonment and fines. Less serious breaches, including, but not limited to, breaching notification and
registration duties as well as interference with telecommunications, are subject to fines up to CHF 100,000,
depending on the specific facts of the case. Furthermore, the FMG also provides for administrative penalties. If
an enterprise infringes the applicable law, its license requirements or a binding decree, it may be required to pay
a fine in the amount up to 10 percent of its average turnover in Switzerland in the last three financial years. While
ComCom and OFCOM are the governing bodies that supervise the telecommunications market in Switzerland
and enforce the regulatory framework, the FMG provides the due process regime.

**_Telecommunications Installations_**

In Switzerland, a permit by the competent authorities is required to construct telecommunications installations,
the most important of which are antennas. The radio spectrum licenses do not grant the right to obtain such permit.

Depending on whether an antenna is planned within or outside of a building zone, different requirements by
different authorities apply, i.e., the provisions regarding antennas within a building zone are defined by the cantons
and towns whereas the provisions regarding antennas outside of a building zone (for which permits are only
granted in exceptional cases) are defined at the national level. In addition, apart from the provisions regarding
spatial planning, the provisions regarding nature and landscape protection, the protection for built landscapes, the
protection from radio emissions, the protection from non-ionizing radiation with lower limit values for specific
installations (e.g., 6 v/m for high bands, compared to similar general exposure limit values of, e.g., 61 v/m for
high bands) than in the European Union, as well as the provisions of the Ordinance on Telecommunications
Installations (Verordnung über Fernmeldeanlagen (“FAV”)) regulating technical compliance need to be taken
into account. Numerous decisions of cantonal and federal courts have been issued in connection with
telecommunications installations, which are relevant for future construction permits. In order to secure
consistency in the application of various requirements, the federal authorities have issued guidelines regarding the
construction of antennas. These guidelines, inter alia, set forth principles for the responsible authorities when
deciding on the permit to construct an antenna. Furthermore, our license explicitly sets forth that we are obliged
to respect, inter alia, the statutory provisions regarding spatial planning, protection from radio emissions, nature
and landscape protection as well as the protection of built landscapes and the respective guidelines of the
responsible federal authorities as well as the ordinance on the protection from non-ionizing radiation.

Accordingly, there is a risk that the further deployment of our mobile network could encounter problems and
delays due to disputes and discussions regarding the positioning of particular antennas. The tightening of the
regulatory framework is pushed forward by various interest groups, which are, _inter alia, collecting votes for_
public initiatives calling for stricter regulation of non-ionizing radiation. If such initiative is signed by 100,000
voters, a public vote may be called and, to pass, must be approved by a majority of the votes and the Swiss cantons.
All telecommunications service providers, including us, face certain disputes and particular negotiation situations
in relation to the construction of antennas, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—
_Our business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental requirements_
_relating to mobile telecommunications transmission equipment and devices, including the location of antennas.”_

**_Access Regime_**

Pursuant to the FMG, any provider of telecommunications services that is determined to be market dominant
must, upon request by another telecommunications provider, provide the following minimum access to its
infrastructure and services on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis and at cost-based prices in accordance
with the long run incremental costs (“LRIC”) method:

#### • fully unbundled access to the local loop, however only to twisted copper pair local loops and
notably not cable, fiber and mobile infrastructures;


-----

#### • interconnection services (including, at a minimum, origination, transit and termination of calls,
number identification and suppression, access to value-added services (08xx, 09xx), and thirdparty physical interconnection for connection of services);

#### • leased lines; and 

 • access to cable ducts with sufficient capacities. 

The above obligations to grant access apply to both mobile and landline telecommunication network operators,
with the exception of the mandatory local loop unbundling which is limited to incumbent Swisscom’s legacy
landline infrastructure (twisted copper pair local loops) and notably excludes cable, fiber and mobile
infrastructures. Although proposals for amendments have been made in the past, there is currently no regulation
on a cost-based access to fiber (or other modern infrastructure) and, until further changes are introduced, we will
only receive limited access to modern infrastructures (such as FTTH) for the foreseeable future; however,
Swisscom, Sunrise and local utility operators are, in view of the threat of new regulation, under pressure to provide
access to FTTH at non-discriminatory and competitive conditions. In addition, we have FTTH agreements with
utilities company which grant us access to their FTTH networks.

On September 7, 2017, the Federal Council proposed a partial revision to the FMG. Following the legislative
process, the parliament approved the revised FMG in March 2019 and the respective ordinances in November
2020. The FMG and the respective ordinances entered into force on January 1, 2021, subject to certain transition
periods. Certain of the new legal provisions strengthen the position of consumers. These include measures to
combat unwanted telemarketing (advertising calls) more effectively and consumer rights to advice about technical
measures to protect children and young people on the internet. There are also measures regarding net neutrality
providing that internet providers must transmit data without discriminating, from a technical standpoint or
financial standpoint, between data transferor, data transferee, content, services, type of services, protocols,
application, programs or terminals. Internet providers must also provide information about the actual measured
quality of their services, including internet access speed.

In relation to international roaming, the new legislation enables the Federal Council to combat disproportionately
high end-user prices. In particular, the new legislation provides that the providers have to (i) cap retail roaming
prices by allowing customers to set limits, (ii) invoice per second for roaming and local break out and (iii) offer
options for services at reduced tariffs and packages for data, independent from the billing and the 12-month
validity period.

The regulation of access remains for copper lines only. The parliament decided not to extend it to fiber against
the advice of the federal council and ComCom. Notwithstanding, network operators have acquired a right to access
building access points and to shared use of telecommunications installations inside the building. In principle, this
gives end customers the ability to access the services of all providers.

With the revised FMG, frequency utilization has also been made more flexible. A license to use the radio spectrum
will only be required if such restriction (i) is required to avoid radio-electrical interference, (ii) to ensure the
technical quality of telecommunication services, (iii) to ensure an efficient use of radio frequencies or (iv) as
required by international agreements. In addition, spectrum trading and the shared use of infrastructures for mobile
communication is encouraged. The general obligation to register for telecommunications service providers was
also abolished in connection with the latest revision of the FMG. Under the revised legislation, registration will
be required only for those using specific public resources: radio frequencies subject to licensing or addressing
resources such as blocks of telephone numbers.

The revised legislation also provides a legal basis for blocking internet sites with forbidden pornography and an
obligation to block such sites according to a list of the police federal office. In addition, telecommunication service
providers are obliged to take measures to provide protection from cyber-attacks.

**_Procedures and Disputes on Access_**

A provider that is determined to be market dominant must publish the technical and financial conditions of its
mandatory access services. If such market dominant provider chooses to offer additional access services at nonregulated conditions, it must publish those conditions as well. Non market-dominant providers may also offer a
variety of access services at transparent, though unregulated, conditions. These offerings are generally published
by the regulatory authority as well.

Access must be granted at cost-based prices. Calculations are based on the MEA and LRIC, an added constant
premium based on a proportional share of the relevant joint and common costs and a return on the capital used for


-----

investments as well as the replacement costs of modern equivalent assets (current cost accounting). According to
the revised FDV, ducts are assessed based on infrastructure renewal accounting. Costs are based on a modern
fiber and IP-infrastructure (next generation network and access).

Upon request, access is granted by entering into an access agreement and an interconnection agreement (together
referred to as “IC Agreements”). All IC Agreements, irrespective of whether a market dominant provider is
involved, must be disclosed to OFCOM and OFCOM, upon request, provides access to IC Agreements to any
interested party, unless justified private or public interests prevail.

The mandatory access regime for market dominant providers is an _ex-post_ regulation scheme. The regulator
(ComCom) determines the conditions and prices of access services of market dominant providers only upon
request and only if negotiations during a three-month negotiation period have failed. The subject of an access
dispute may concern whether the defending provider is market dominant, the scope of mandatory access obligation
(or whether the defending provider, if deemed market dominant, must offer the technical access service as
particularly requested by the claiming provider), and/or the price or other conditions at which the requested access
should be granted. In summary, ComCom will only issue an order setting the scope of the access and the price
conditions if the defending provider is held market dominant, the requested access is considered mandatory, and
the parties disagree on the price or other terms. There are currently various interconnection proceedings pending
against Swisscom. We currently have interconnection proceedings pending against Swisscom for the period 2014–
2023. In addition, interconnection proceedings against Swisscom concerning fixed termination and leased lines
are pending before the Swiss Federal Administrative Court. Also pending before the Swiss Federal Administrative
Court is an action by Sunrise against Swisscom regarding further services.

**_Universal Services_**

The regime on universal services regulates services to be offered throughout Switzerland to the entire population
(including in remote regions). The provision of universal services requires ComCom to grant a license
(Grundversorgungskonzession) for a limited time based on specified conditions. The Swiss Federal Council
(Bundesrat) resolved to more than triple the required speed for uploads and downloads effective as of January 1,
2020 and from 2024, clients will have the selection between the existing universal service and an additional, eight
times faster speed. Theoretically, any telecommunications provider may apply for a universal services license,
which are auctioned and allocated to those providers that best satisfy the quality requirements. As a matter of
practice, however, Swisscom is currently the only owner of a universal services license in Switzerland and is,
therefore, obliged to supply a certain range of high-quality voice telephony, data transmission and additional
services at _ex ante_ regulated prices, while complying with the technical specifications issued by OFCOM. In
return, Swisscom receives government compensation to cover parts of the costs incurred for providing universal
services. This compensation is funded by fees obtained from all registered telecommunications service providers
in Switzerland, including us, on the basis of each provider’s gross revenue.

The current universal service license granted to Swisscom will expire at the end of 2023. The universal license
has again been granted to Swisscom as the only requestor for the period from 2024 until 2031.

**Mobile Regulatory Environment**

**_License Obligation_**

Providers of mobile telecommunications services that wish to maintain their own mobile network must obtain
licenses from ComCom or, in certain cases, from OFCOM to use radio frequencies. In Switzerland, we currently
hold our first license awarded in the 2012 spectrum auction which is due to expire on December 31, 2028. This
spectrum license is a technology neutral license which includes the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2.1 GHz
and 2.6 GHz spectrum awarded to us. In December 2021, we renewed our licenses to operate point-to-point radio
relay systems (Richtfunkkonzessionen) until December 31, 2026. Our second mobile frequencies license in
Switzerland awarded in the 5G spectrum auction is due to expire in April 2034. This spectrum license is a
technology neutral license including 5G-compatible spectrum in the 700 MHz, 1400 MHz and 3.5 GHz bands.

**_2012 Spectrum Auction_**

In February 2012, OFCOM, on behalf of ComCom, auctioned at the time free mobile radio frequencies and those
which became free by 2014 and 2017, including those of the so-called digital dividend (former broadcasting
frequencies). As a result of this award, more spectrum was made available to mobile operators than they previously
had in service and mobile operations were better able to meet the rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband
services, expand their networks using the latest mobile radio technologies such as LTE (Long-Term Evolution)
and offer high-quality mobile radio services to consumers in Switzerland. Under the auction process, the frequency


-----

allocation between the three main mobile operators Salt, Sunrise and Swisscom was determined by the bidders
rather than a public authority. The licenses granted to Salt in the auction are valid until December 31, 2028.

The detailed result of the auction is as follows:

**MHz** **Salt** **Sunrise** **Swisscom**

800 ................................................................................. 20 MHz 20 MHz 20 MHz

900 ................................................................................. 10 MHz 30 MHz 30 MHz

**_5G Spectrum Auction_**

On February 8, 2019, ComCom announced the results of the auction for the newly available spectrum in the 700
MHz, 1400 MHz and 3.4–3.8 GHz frequency bands which will enable operators to deploy 5G radio technology
network in Switzerland. Salt secured 2x10MHz of 700 MHz FDD spectrum as well as 10 MHz of 1,400 MHz
SDL spectrum and 80 MHz of 3.5GHz TDD spectrum for a total of CHF 94.5 million. We believe we have secured
an adequate amount of spectrum to further reinforce our mobile network in collaboration with our European
infrastructure partner Nokia and to provide our customers with a 5G coverage and next-generation speed, latency
and capacity.

The detailed result of the auction is as follows:

**MHz** **Salt** **Sunrise** **Swisscom**

700MHz FDD ................................................................ 20 MHz 10 MHz 30 MHz

700MHz SDL ................................................................ — 10 MHz —

Compared to 5G auctions in other European countries, the 2019 5G auction in Switzerland had the lowest
spectrum cost, with proceeds of CHF 0.02/CHF x PoP, compared to CHF 0.08 in the United Kingdom, CHF 0.15
in France, CHF 0.18 in Germany and CHF 0.41 in Italy. The new frequencies were allocated to the three mobile
operators with technology neutral licenses and were available for use from April 17, 2019. These licenses became
effective on May 29, 2019 and are valid until April 17, 2034.

The following table summarizes the spectrum held by each operator:

**Salt** **Sunrise** **Swisscom**

700 MHz – Paired 20Mhz 10Mhz 30 Mhz

700 MHz – Unpaired – 10Mhz –

800 MHz – Paired 20Mhz 20Mhz 20Mhz

**_Network Infrastructure Roll-out and Deployment_**

With respect to the roll-out and further deployment of our mobile network in Switzerland, we are subject to the
proceedings and regulations concerning the construction and maintenance of antennas. All mobile operators face,
in the ordinary course of business, certain disputes and particular negotiation situations in relation to the
deployment of particular antennas. Furthermore, the radio emissions of antennas are subject to both regulation
that is more rigid than in the European Union and public discussion. Accordingly, there is a risk that the further
deployment of our mobile network could encounter problems and delays due to disputes and discussions regarding
the positioning of particular antennas. Current initiatives against 5G deployment, including constructing more
antenna with higher frequency emissions, among certain activist groups and the reaction of some politicians and
authorities on a cantonal and communal level may result in more effort and costs and a resulting delay for the
rollout of our network. This concerns not only new sites and 5G but also upgrades to existing sites and former
technologies as 3G and 4G. Swiss Cantonal parliaments (e.g., Geneva, Jura, and Vaud) accepted initiatives against
5G deployment (by accepting a moratorium for the construction of new 5G antennas). The Swiss Federal Office
for Communications and the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, however, have issued a joint statement
proclaiming that only the Swiss Confederation is competent to adopt such a moratorium. This suggests that the
moratoriums adopted by the Cantons in order to avoid 5G deployment could be illegal (due to lack of competences
of such Cantons). In general, politicians rejecting 5G deployment can be found across the political spectrum.

**_Pricing_**

With respect to pricing, mobile telecommunications providers are free to set wholesale (such as roaming or call
termination) and retail prices, subject to antitrust standards applicable in general and interconnection obligations
as set forth in the access regime discussed above. Following a request from another mobile network operator,
ComCom could, pursuant to the FMG, regulate MTRs (or other types of interconnection and/or access fees) on a
LRIC basis if the operator was held to be market dominant in the relevant market. In the case of MTRs, ComCo
has found that the nationwide mobile network of each operator (including ours) is to be seen as a distinct product
market where every operator has a market share of 100%. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that one
of our competitors could invoke interconnection and request from ComCom (and, following an appeal, the courts)
to oblige us to interconnect at regulated (LRIC) prices, thereby lowering our MTRs. There is also constant political
pressure to lower MTRs and retail prices for mobile telecommunication in general.

In September 2011, the National Council (Nationalrat) voted in favor of a motion brought by a member of the
Swiss Parliament to define maximum limits on international roaming prices. In November 2014, the Swiss Federal
Council (Bundesrat) published a report on developments in roaming prices and potential regulatory measures
recommending not to regulate roaming tariffs. As a result of political debates, political pressure and the pressure
from regulatory authorities, all Swiss operators reduced their roaming prices. In January 2015, a committee of the
Council of States (Ständerat), however, recommended to follow a parliamentary motion to enact maximum
roaming tariffs. In March 2015, the Council of States (Ständerat) rejected the motion to regulate roaming tariffs
due to the recent price reductions of Swisscom, Sunrise and ourselves, but the Swiss Federal Council and the
Swiss Federal Price Supervisor continue to observe the development of roaming prices. The Swiss Federal Council
and the Swiss Federal Price Supervisor both indicated that the impact of the local break out regulations in the
European Union and the voluntary implementation of such local break out options by Swiss telecommunication
services providers for their customers should be further observed. If the local break out regulation in the European
Union has the intended effect and if Swiss telecommunication providers do not voluntarily implement such local
break out options, the Swiss Federal Council may consider implementing additional measures. With the revision
of the FMG and the respective ordinances, among other things, administrative rules from the Swiss Federal
Council to cap retail roaming prices by allowing customers to set limits, oblige operators to invoice per second
for roaming and local break in case of market failure have been introduced.

**Landline Regulatory Environment**

Providers of telecommunications services in Switzerland are not subject to any authorization or licensing
requirements but have an obligation to notify OFCOM of their intent to provide such services. OFCOM maintains
a public list of registered telecommunications providers. The Company has been registered with OFCOM as
landline telecommunication services provider since January 1, 2001. Foreign entities that wish to offer landline
telecommunications services in Switzerland are, in addition to the requirement to register, subject to bi- or
multilateral conventions and ComCom may prohibit a foreign entity from providing landline telecommunication
services in Switzerland if the foreign provider’s country of origin does not grant the same operational freedom to
Swiss incorporated providers offering services in that particular country of origin.

The new FMG abolishes the registration requirement for landline telecommunications services providers that do
not use addressing elements from the E.164, the international public telecommunication numbering plan.


-----

A landline telecommunication services provider may base its services either on its own landline network
infrastructure or on the infrastructure of other providers by means of interconnection agreements. Any provider
of telecommunication services may invoke the access regime, as discussed above, to access other providers’
infrastructure for the provision of its own services. Furthermore, the infrastructure of providers that are determined
to be market dominant may be used at regulated conditions and prices. The regulated access is limited to local
loop unbundling of incumbent Swisscom’s legacy landline infrastructure (twisted copper pair local loops) and
notably excludes cable, fiber and mobile infrastructures.

Pursuant to the regulatory framework, landline telecommunications providers are free to set their wholesale and
retail prices for landline telecommunications services, with the exception of providers that have been determined
to be market dominant by OFCOM, who have to offer certain access services at ex-post regulated prices in case
an interconnection proceeding is raised by another party, and providers of universal services, who are subjected
to ex ante regulation of universal services.

**Other Regulatory Environment**

**_Regulation on Transmission of TV and Radio Programs_**

The transmission of TV and radio programs is considered a telecommunications service and is, therefore, subject
to the regulations set forth in the Swiss Telecommunications Act. Accordingly, while transmissions over mobile
networks require mobile licenses, no such license is required for transmissions over landline networks.

TV offerings are further subject to specific regulations pertaining to the Swiss TV and radio market and
particularly the RTVG. Under the RTVG, a mobile and/or landline network operator that transmits TV and radio
programs in particular needs to offer distribution to all broadcasters on a non-discriminatory basis. The RTVG
further regulates the permitted contents of TV and radio and network operators must comply with orders of the
regulator (OFCOM) not to distribute prohibited content. Finally, the RTVG sets forth regulations for operators
regarding content that must be carried. In order to address the technical modernization of TV and radio program
transmission, various amendments to the law have been and are currently being discussed, including the regulation
of replay TV due to the associated advertising losses, streaming, and the levy of copyright fees. Pursuant to an
industry agreement, since October 2022, on certain TV channels, replay TV no longer allows for the skipping of
advertisement and the replay TV function is now no longer free for customers.

**_International Roaming_**

Switzerland only provides for limited regulation on roaming. In 2011, the Swiss National Council (Nationalrat)
approved the motion calling for “an end to exorbitant mobile charges abroad.” A similar motion was passed
in 2013. The motion calls for fixed and binding maximum tariffs to be adopted by all telecommunication providers
for inbound and outbound calls, SMS messages and data transfers abroad. The Swiss Council of States (Ständerat)
decided in 2013 to suspend the motions until the end of 2014 and to commission the Swiss Federal Council
(Bundesrat) to deliver a report to the Swiss Parliament by the end of 2014 on the trend in roaming prices, which
was published in the same year. The Swiss Federal Council (Bundesrat) recommended not to regulate roaming
tariffs, but to include specific instruments in a revision of the FMG, such as local break out and specific charging
obligations. In 2015, the Swiss Council of States (Ständerat) ultimately rejected the motion to regulate roaming
tariffs due to the recent price reductions of Swisscom, Sunrise and ourselves.

On May 3, 2023, the Swiss National Council (Nationalrat) adopted a motion calling for the introduction of price
caps for roaming services provided abroad by Swiss telecommunication providers, even though the Swiss Federal
Council (Bundesrat) had called for the motion to be rejected in November 2021, arguing that the introduction of
unilateral price caps for roaming would require a revision of the FMG and that it could therefore not set these
price caps by ordinance. It remains to be seen how the Swiss Council of States (Ständerat) will decide on the
motion. The motion will be discussed by the relevant committee of the Swiss Council of States (Ständerat) in
August 2023.

In addition, a motion was submitted to the Swiss National Council (Nationalrat) on 17 March 2023 which calls
for telecommunication providers to set a pre-set cost limit of a maximum of CHF 100.00 for all roaming costs
abroad. The Swiss Federal Council (Bundesrat) rejects the motion because telecommunication providers are
already obliged to offer their customers the option of setting individual cost limits for roaming services, which
already prevents bill shocks. The Swiss National Council (Nationalrat) has not yet voted on the motion.

With the revision of the FMG and the respective ordinances, among other things, administrative rules from the
Swiss Federal Council to cap retail roaming prices by allowing customers to set limits, oblige operators to invoice
per second for roaming and local break in case of market failure have been introduced. Since July 1, 2021,
operators must invoice per second or per kilobyte for roaming and local break out, respectively. Furthermore, at


-----

the conclusion of an agreement, a price cap must be set for roaming services, the credit of a purchased roaming
option may not expire during 12 months and the start time of a roaming option must be freely selectable.

**_Network Neutrality_**

In 2015, the Swiss Council of States, as the second chamber of parliament, rejected the introduction of network
neutrality regulation. With the revision of the FMG, net neutrality obligations (open internet), however, have
been introduced and could lead to additional restrictions in providing internet-based services. Pursuant to the
revised FMG and respective ordinances, providers are only allowed to treat information differently from a
technological and/or economic perspective if it is necessary to comply with a regulation or a court decision, to
protect the integrity or safety of the net, upon express request of the customer, or to fight temporary and
exceptional network congestions. If information is treated differently, the internet service provider must inform
customers and the public. Furthermore, the providers may offer special services (e.g., voice telephony via fourth
generation mobile telephony (VoLTE) and certain television services (IPTV)) over the same line as internet. If
providers offer such special services, these services must not degrade the quality of internet access services.

**_Surveillance of Telecommunications Services_**

Pursuant to the BÜPF, a telecommunications service provider is, upon request of the PTSS, obliged to gather data
required for criminal investigations. Telecommunications service providers are therefore required to maintain own
infrastructure appropriate for such surveillance and to be capable of running surveillance operations at any time.
Telecommunications service providers are also bound to provide the PTSS with the names of particular internal
contact persons. The revised BÜPF entered into force on March 1, 2018. The related ordinance (VÜPF) includes
new requirements with regards to mandatory automation of the information requests, identification of postpay
customers and the storage of an ID scan as well as logging of unsuccessful calls as part of the historical data. The
proposed abolishing of the compensation fee for any surveillance/reporting work has not been adopted as part of
the revision. The principle of cost and compensation is being maintained. We face the risk of extended surveillance
obligations which could result in additional capital expenditure and increased operational costs.

The Federal Intelligence Services Act also provides for extended surveillance obligations and the obligation to
cooperate with the authorities in connection with interception of international traffic, which could result in higher
capital expenditure and increased operational costs. On June 1, 2022, the Federal Act on Police Measures to
Combat Terrorism (Bundesgesetz über polizeiliche Massnahmen zur Bekämpfung von Terrorismus (the “PMT”))
also entered into force. Among other things, the PMT allows the Federal Office of Police to electronically monitor
and locate by mobile communication a person who is believed to be engaged in terrorist activities.

**_Further Regulations_**

Telecommunications service providers are subject not only to the regulatory framework set forth in the FMG and
associated ordinances, but also to a number of other laws, regulations and governmental activities that may affect
their business, including antitrust law, laws against unfair competition, laws on data protection, and, in case of
excessive pricing by providers determined to be market dominant, general price regulation. A range of further
laws are of relevance to our business, in particular laws on environment and public health, property and intellectual
property, as well as laws on land use regulation and public and private construction.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material provisions of our principal financing arrangements after giving effect_
_to the Refinancing. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference_
_to, the underlying documents. We recommend you refer to the actual documents for further details, copies of which_
_may be made available by the Issuer upon request. All references to the term “Group,” when used in this_
_“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” section, shall be construed as referring to the Parent_
_Guarantor and each of its restricted subsidiaries._

**Existing Senior Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview_**

On September 12, 2019, the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement with, among others, certain financial institutions as “original lenders,” as defined therein, and Lucid
Agency Services Limited as agent (the “Senior Facility Agent”) and Société Générale, as security agent (the
“Existing Security Agent”). On December 22, 2021, the Parent Guarantor, as the parent, and Lucid Agency
Services Limited, as the agent, entered into an amendment and restatement agreement of the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement.

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (as amended) comprises the following committed facilities:

#### • a €500 million senior secured term loan facility B (“Facility B”); and 

 • a senior secured revolving credit facility of CHF 75,000,000 (the “Revolving Facility” and,
together with Facility B, the “Facilities” and each a “Facility”).

The following is a summary of certain of the principal terms of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement. For the
purposes of this summary of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the term “Group” refers to the Parent
Guarantor and each of its “restricted subsidiaries” from time to time.

**_Structure_**

The “original borrower” for each of Facility B and the Revolving Facility, respectively, is the Issuer. Certain
members of the Group may become an additional borrower under the Revolving Facility, subject to meeting
certain conditions as set out in the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.

Facility B is denominated in euro. The Revolving Facility may be utilized in euro, sterling, U.S. dollars and certain
other currencies with the consent of all the lenders participating in the relevant utilization under the Revolving
Facility.

The Revolving Facility may be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the “termination date” of the
Revolving Facility.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The term loans made available under Facility B bear cash pay interest at a rate per annum equal to SARON, or
for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR (each subject to a floor of zero), plus a margin of 3.50% per annum.
The margin for Facility B is subject to a margin ratchet linked to certain senior secured net leverage levels.

Loans under the Revolving Facility bear cash pay interest at rates per annum equal to, for revolving utilizations
denominated in currencies other than euro, SARON (subject to a floor of zero) or, for revolving utilizations
denominated in euro, EURIBOR (subject to a floor of zero), plus a margin of 3.00% per annum, subject to a
margin ratchet linked to senior secured net leverage levels.

Default interest on each of Facility B and the Revolving Facility will, generally, be calculated as an additional
1.00% on the overdue amount.

In respect of the Revolving Facility a “commitment fee” is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled
amount of the Revolving Facility from (and including) the closing date to the end of the availability period
applicable to the Revolving Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Facility. Such
commitment fee is, generally, payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period applicable to
the Revolving Facility and, if cancelled in full, on the cancelled amount of the relevant Revolving Facility lender’s
commitment at the time the cancellation becomes effective.


-----

The Issuer is required to pay customary agency fees to each of the Senior Facility Agent and the Existing Security
Agent in connection with the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Repayments_**

Facility B has a final maturity date of September 15, 2026, and must be repaid in full on its final maturity date.

The Revolving Facility has a final maturity date of 5 years from the date of first utilization of Facility B and each
loan must be repaid in full at the end of the relevant interest period. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans
made under the Revolving Facility may be re-borrowed, subject to certain conditions being met.

**_Prepayments and Cancellation_**

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement allows for customary voluntary prepayments of each of Facility B and
the Revolving Facility (subject to a minimum amount of €1,000,000 and integral multiples thereof).

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement also includes certain “mandatory prepayment events” including:

#### • a “change of control” put right in the event of a “change of control” which is not a “specified
change of control event”; and

#### • an “excess cash flow sweep,” requiring mandatory prepayments of Facility B with excess cash
flow, subject to certain senior secured net leverage levels and certain exceptions.

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement also contains provisions:

#### • requiring mandatory prepayment of a lender’s participation in the relevant Facility where it
becomes unlawful for that lender to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement or to fund, issue or maintain its commitment or
participation in any utilization of Facility B and/or the Revolving Facility;

#### • allowing for cancellation of the commitment(s) of a single lender and prepayment of that
lender’s participation in utilizations under Facility B and/or the Revolving Facility, in certain
circumstances where (x) the relevant borrower is required to pay additional amounts under the
tax gross up provisions of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, (y) a lender claims
indemnification from the Issuer or an “Obligor” (as defined below) under the “tax indemnity”
or “increased costs” provisions of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement or (z) a lender
requests payment from the Issuer or an Obligor based on the occurrence of a “market disruption
event”;

#### • allowing for cancellation of the available commitments of a “defaulting lender” (which,
generally, refers to a lender that (i) has failed to make its participation in a loan available, (ii) has
otherwise disaffirmed, rescinded or repudiated a finance document relating to the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement (together, the “Senior Facilities Finance Documents”) or (iii) is or
has become subject to an “insolvency event” which is continuing and prepayment of that
defaulting lender’s participation in utilization under Facility B and/or the Revolving Facility;
and

#### • allowing for cancellation of commitments of a “non-consenting lender” (which, generally,
refers to a lender that has not approved or rejected a request for a consent, release, waiver or
amendment of any provision of the Senior Facilities Finance Documents which requires greater
than “majority lender” consent (generally, those lenders representing more than 50% of the total
commitments outstanding under the Facilities) within a period of 10 business days (or such
shorter period as the Issuer and the Senior Facility Agent may agree)), and prepayment of all of
that lender’s participation in Facility B and the Revolving Facility.

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement provides for customary “additional” facilities to be included thereunder,
which accordion facilities can be raised, generally, subject to an overall permitted indebtedness cap of
approximately CHF 418.0 million or, if higher, an amount equal to 100% of the applicable consolidated earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of the Group, subject to meeting certain conditions.


-----

The Revolving Facility may, upon cancellation of the Revolving Facility commitments in full, be converted into
or replaced with a “super senior” revolving facility provided that there will be no ability to incur any Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility until Facility B is discharged in full.

**_Guarantees_**

As at the date of this offering memorandum, the members of the Group which are guarantors of each of the
Facilities comprise the Parent Guarantor and the Company (together, the “Obligors” and each an “Obligor”).

Subject to the operation of any applicable guarantee limitations set out in the relevant Senior Facilities Finance
Documents, each of the Obligors currently provides a guarantee of all amounts payable to the finance parties
under the Senior Facilities Finance Documents.

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement provides that, subject to certain “agreed security principles” as set out
therein and certain “excluded subsidiaries” (including “unrestricted subsidiaries”), generally, each subsidiary of
the Issuer incorporated in a “Covered Jurisdiction” (as defined below) and that is or becomes a subsidiary
representing 5% or more of consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Group,
as determined by reference to the most recent compliance certificate delivered under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement in respect of the latest annual financial statements of the Group (each such entity, a “Material
Subsidiary”)), is required to become a guarantor under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (the “Material
Subsidiary Test”).

Furthermore, the Issuer must ensure that, on the date on which the annual financial statements are required to be
delivered to the Senior Facility Agent in each financial year (commencing with the annual financial statements to
be delivered for the financial year ending 2019), by reference to such annual financial statements, generally, the
aggregate (without double counting) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the guarantors
of the Facilities equals or exceeds 80 percent. of consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of the members of the Group incorporated in the Covered Jurisdictions (the “Guarantor Coverage
Test”).

The “Covered Jurisdictions” for the purposes of the Material Subsidiary Test and the Guarantor Coverage Test
are Luxembourg, Switzerland and any jurisdiction that a borrower is incorporated.

**_Security_**

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement is secured by the same collateral as the collateral securing the Existing
Euro 2027 Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Euro 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the Remaining 2024 Euro
Senior Secured Notes and that will secure the Notes.

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement also requires each Material Subsidiary or any other member of the
Group which becomes a guarantor of the Facilities, subject to certain “agreed security principles” as set out in the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, to grant security over its material assets as the Senior Facility Agent and/or
the Security Agent may require and security to be granted over its shares.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement contains customary representations and warranties (subject to certain
exceptions and qualifications), with certain representations and warranties to be repeated on certain dates,
including:

#### • status, binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, validity
and admissibility in evidence, governing law and enforcement, consents, filings and laws
applicable to operations, pari passu ranking;

#### • no insolvency, no filing or stamp taxes, no proceedings pending or threatened, environmental
laws, taxation;

#### • no default, no misleading information in the information memorandum prepared in connection
with the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and original financial statements of the Group
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group;

#### • intellectual property; 

 • center of main interests and establishments; and 


-----

#### • sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption. 

**_Covenants_**

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement requires compliance with certain affirmative undertakings, including:

#### • authorizations and consents; 

 • compliance with laws and compliance with environmental permits and laws; 

 • payment of taxes; 

 • insurance; 

 • pension schemes; 

 • intellectual property; 

 • compliance with the Guarantor Coverage Test; 

 • further assurance in respect of the guarantees and security for the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement;

#### • sanctions; and 

 • obtaining and maintaining a credit rating. 

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement also contains certain negative undertakings as to actions that may be
taken by members of the Group, including as to debt incurrence, making “restricted payments,” sales of assets
and subsidiary stock, incurrence of liens and “permitted collateral liens” on the security for the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement, impairment of the security interests for the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, merger
and consolidation of members of the Group and entry into transactions with affiliates.

**_Financial Covenant—Revolving Facility_**

The Revolving Facility has the benefit of a customary “springing” senior secured net leverage ratio financial
covenant, set at 40% underperformance to structuring EBITDA (assuming for these purposes that Facility B is
drawn in full and the Revolving Facility is 40% drawn and that there is zero cash on balance sheet/cash
overfunding) which will take effect (subject to satisfaction of the conditions necessary for the relevant covenant
to be tested), after a “holiday period” of four accounting quarters following the date of first utilization of Facility
B.

The financial covenant shall only be tested when the aggregate outstanding principal amount of cash loans
outstanding under the Revolving Facility (excluding loans to fund OID, flex fees or expenses, ancillary facilities
and letters of credit) at 5 pm on relevant quarter end date net of cash/cash equivalents exceeds CHF 35,000,000.

The Issuer may cure breaches of the Revolving Facility financial covenant by applying an equity contribution as
a “cure amount”. Cure amounts may be applied to increase Consolidated EBITDA, to reduce consolidated senior
secured net debt or to prepay outstanding Revolving Facility drawings to below the springing covenant threshold
(at the Issuer’s option), provided that there shall be no cap on the cure amount and no requirement to actually
apply the relevant cure amount in prepayment of the Revolving Facility.

In each period of 4 consecutive quarters there must be at least two quarters without a cure, and cap of 5 cures over
life of the Revolving Facility, in each case, only in respect of equity cures added to Consolidated EBITDA or in
reduction of consolidated senior secured net debt. Other restrictions relating thereto will be as set out in the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.

In addition to the above, a “deemed cure” shall apply in scenarios where the financial covenant detailed above is
satisfied on any subsequent test date (or, if elected by the Company, month end date which is not a quarter end
date) or on the first date on which the Revolving Facility is repaid below the springing covenant threshold.

**_Covenant Suspension_**

During the period that a “release condition” is satisfied (generally, where (i) a listing has occurred and the
consolidated net leverage ratio for the Group (adjusted as if the proceeds of such listing have been or will be


-----

applied in prepayment of the Facilities) is equal to or less than 3.75x or (ii) the long term corporate credit rating
of the Group or holding company of the Issuer is equal to or better than Baa3/BBB-), among other things, certain
mandatory prepayment requirements, certain affirmative and negative undertakings (including limitations on
indebtedness and restricted payments) and the requirement to comply with the Revolving Facility financial
covenant shall be suspended.

**_Events of Default_**

Customary “events of default” have been included in the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of
which would allow, unless otherwise indicated below, the “majority lenders” (generally, those lenders
representing more than 50% of the total commitments outstanding under the Facilities) to direct the Senior Facility
Agent to accelerate all or part of the outstanding loans and/or terminate all commitments under the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods, financial thresholds, cure rights, clean-up
periods and other qualifications), including:

#### • non-payment of amounts due under the Senior Facilities Finance Documents; 

 • breach of the Revolving Facility financial covenant, provided that, in the event of such breach,
only the lenders under the Revolving Facility representing more than 50.1% of the total
commitments outstanding under the Revolving Facility shall initially be entitled to take
“enforcement action”;

#### • non-compliance with other obligations under the Senior Facilities Finance Documents; 

 • inaccuracy of representation, warranty or written statement when made; 

 • invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Facilities Finance Documents; 

 • non-compliance, in any material respect, with the Intercreditor Agreement by any member of
the Group, any “Subordinated Creditor” (as defined below) party to the Intercreditor Agreement
or certain of the investors in the Group and their respective affiliates (each a “Sponsor
Affiliate”);

#### • cross-default for failure to pay principal or interest in respect of indebtedness of the Group, the
principal amount of which equals or exceeds CHF 60.0 million; and

#### • insolvency, insolvency proceedings or creditors’ processes (and similar events in other
jurisdictions).

**_Governing Law_**

The Existing Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, MMH (the “Original
Parent”), each of the Guarantors and any other entity which accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor
(together the “Debtors”) have entered into the Intercreditor Agreement dated January 30, 2012 and amended and
restated on February 3, 2012 and 2012, September 11, 2012, as amended by an amendment letter dated
February 21, 2012 an a deed of amendment dated February 23, 2015, and as amended and restated by an
amendment agreement dated April 15, 2015 and as further amended from time to time, with, among others, the
Existing Security Agent, the lenders under our Senior Facilities Agreement and the senior agent under our Senior

Intercreditor Agreement as Debtors. The Parent Guarantor acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement on April 23,
2015 as the Parent. The Issuer acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement on April 23, 2015 as the Company. The
Trustee acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement on November 27, 2017. The Trustee will accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date. The Notes will be designated as Permitted Senior Financing Debt in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date. The Intercreditor Agreement is
governed by English law and sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the
Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be made in respect of
debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness, the terms pursuant to


-----

which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions.

Capitalized terms set forth and used in this section entitled “—Intercreditor Agreement” have the same meanings

reference to the term “Permitted Senior Financing Debt” shall be construed to include indebtedness incurred under
and in connection with the Notes offered hereby. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available
to investors upon request.

**_Amendments to Intercreditor Agreement_**

On April 23, 2015, the Intercreditor Agreement was amended by an amendment agreement between, among
others, the Original Parent and the Existing Security Agent. The key effects of the amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement were to:

#### • provide that, on and from April 23, 2015, the definition of Parent shall refer to the Parent
Guarantor; and

#### • provide that, on and from April 23, 2015, the definition of Company shall refer to the Issuer.

and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt or the issue of additional Senior Notes and/or Senior Parent Notes and
any super senior revolving credit facility (the “Priority Revolving Facility”) (each, a “Debt Refinancing”). Each
party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of the then


-----

current Secured Debt Documents and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in order to facilitate
such a Debt Refinancing including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake of any guarantee or security,
subject to certain conditions. At the option of the Parent, a Debt Refinancing may be made available on a basis
which is senior to, pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, shall be entitled to benefit from all or
any of the security, may be made available on a secured or unsecured basis (subject to certain restrictions) and
may be effected in whole or in part by way of a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent
transaction, in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements. Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary Creditor agrees that it shall co-operate
with the Parent, each other member of the Group and each agent in order to facilitate any Debt Refinancing
(including by way of, at the request and cost of the Parent, executing any document or agreement and/or giving
instructions to any person). In the event of any refinancing or replacement of all or any part of the Senior Lender
Liabilities (or any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness from time to time), the Parent shall be entitled to
require that the definition of Instructing Group is amended such that the relevant refinancing or replacement
indebtedness is treated in the same manner as the Senior Facilities (meaning that for the purpose of calculating
the voting entitlement of any person, at the option of the Parent all or any part of the relevant refinancing or
replacement indebtedness may be treated as Senior Secured Credit Participations of the Senior Creditors and not
Senior Notes/Permitted Financing Credit Participations). In the event that any Priority Revolving Facility becomes
subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent shall be entitled to require that all or any part
of the liabilities in relation to Hedging Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall rank in right
and priority of payment pari passu with that Priority Revolving Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may
result in such Hedging Liabilities ranking ahead of the Senior Notes liabilities and/or the Senior Parent Notes
liabilities), and/or the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities, in
each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements.

Any Priority Revolving Facility implemented pursuant to a Debt Refinancing shall comply with, among others,
the following limitations:

_Ranking of a Debt Refinancing_

No liabilities or obligations in respect of any Priority Revolving Facility may rank in right and priority of payment
ahead of the amounts set out in paragraph (i) of the section captioned “—Application of Proceeds.”

Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements, any
Priority Revolving Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the Parent.

_Enforcement: Debt Refinancing_

The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Revolving Facility to:

instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security;

give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the security as they see fit; and/or

otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured Parties than,
those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Revolving Facility (if any), in each case as at the
date such Priority Revolving Facility is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the Group and as
determined by the Parent (with any such determination to be conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

The Senior Note holders and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided with
an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Revolving
Facility consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation
to the Senior Lender Liabilities as set out in the paragraph captioned “—Restrictions Relating
_to Senior Secured Liabilities—Option to Purchase: Senior Secured Creditors.”_

The Senior Parent Agent(s) shall be provided with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to
any liabilities in respect of a Priority Revolving Facility consistent in all material respects with
the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out in the paragraph captioned “—Payment Obligations and
_Capitalization of Interest Continue—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors.”_


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Senior Parent Liabilities and Security,” the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than the Parent) to the creditors in relation to
the Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations, the Senior Notes, the Senior Parent Notes, the Permitted Senior
Financing Debt and the Permitted Parent Financing Debt (the “Primary Creditors”) shall rank in right and priority
of payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

#### • first, the liabilities of the lenders, issuing banks and ancillary lenders under the Senior Facilities
(each a “Senior Lender” and such liabilities the “Senior Lender Liabilities”), the Senior Notes
liabilities and the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, amounts due
to the Senior Notes Trustee and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and
without any preference between them; and

#### • second, the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari
_passu between themselves and without any preference between them._

The liabilities owed by the Parent to the Primary Creditors shall rank pari passu in right and priority of payment
without any preference among them.

_Priority of Security_

The security shall secure the relevant liabilities (but only to the extent that such security is expressed to secure the
relevant liabilities) in the order provided for under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

_Senior Parent Liabilities and Security_

Any Senior Parent Notes liabilities and Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities owed by the Parent are senior
obligations of the Parent. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, until the date the Senior Lender Liabilities, the
Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Notes liabilities and the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities have been
discharged (the “Senior Discharge Date”), creditors in relation to Senior Parent Notes liabilities and Permitted
Parent Financing Liabilities may not take any steps to appropriate the assets of the Parent subject to the Security
Documents in connection with any Enforcement Action (as defined below), other than as expressly permitted by
the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities of the Group and the liabilities of the Group
to an investor are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors.

_Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_

The creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that the Debtors (or
any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees of such liabilities) or
refinance or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring guarantee liabilities in respect of such refinancing
or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu with any other liabilities and/or share pari passu
in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities and/or to share in any security behind any such other
liabilities.

The creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the cost of the
Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and facilitating such financing,
refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security to take place in a timely manner. In particular, each
of the secured parties authorizes and directs each of its respective agents and the Security Agent to execute any
amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt documents required by the Parent to reflect, enable
and/or facilitate any such arrangements.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Secured Liabilities (as defined below) at any time,
provided that following the occurrence of an acceleration event with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Senior Notes and/or any Permitted Senior Financing Debt, which is continuing, no Debtor may make (and no
Senior Secured Creditor (as defined below) may receive) payments of Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Notes


-----

liabilities or Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities except for recoveries distributed in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below), the Parent and the
Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance documents in relation to the Senior Facilities,
the Senior Notes and the Permitted Senior Financing Debt, in accordance with their respective terms from time to
time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors_

The Senior Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Senior Note holders, the Senior Notes Trustee and any
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors (the “Senior Secured Creditors”) may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

#### • any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Notes liabilities or the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities
in addition to the shared security provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to
certain agreed security principles:

##### • the security provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not
already a party in that capacity);

##### • all amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor with respect
to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security Agent and applied in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;
and

##### • any such security may only be enforced in accordance with the provisions set out under
the caption “—Enforcement of Security—Security Held by Other Creditors.”

#### • any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group
regarding any of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Notes
liabilities or the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities in addition to those in:

##### • the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture or any Permitted Senior
Financing Document;

##### • the Intercreditor Agreement; or 

 • any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the
liabilities, the benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible
and subject to certain agreed security principles, given to all the senior secured parties
in respect of their senior secured liabilities,

provided that, to the extent legally possible, and subject to certain agreed security principles,

#### • the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not already
a party in that capacity);

#### • such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

#### • any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the
Group in connection with:

#### • any escrow or similar or equivalent arrangements entered into in respect of amounts which are
being held (or will be held) by a person which is not a member of the Group prior to release of
those amounts to a member of the Group; or

#### • any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge of any Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Notes liabilities and any Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities (in each case provided that such defeasance, redemption, prepayment,
repayment, purchase or other discharge is not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement).


-----

_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Senior Notes Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that none of the Senior Lenders, the Senior Note holders, the Senior Notes
Trustee or any Permitted Senior Financing Creditors may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior
written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after the
occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (each an “Insolvency Event”) in relation to a Debtor or the
Parent, each Senior Lender, Senior Note holder, Senior Notes Trustee or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor
may, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant debt documents, take certain Enforcement Action and/or
claim in the winding up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of that Debtor for
liabilities owing to it (but may not direct the Security Agent, pursuant to this paragraph, to enforce the common
security in any manner).

_Option to Purchase: Senior Secured Creditors_

Senior Note holders holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (the “Senior Secured
Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event which is continuing, by giving not less
than ten (10) days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees), in
accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, of all, but not part, of the rights,
benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities if:

that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Senior Facilities Agreement;

any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement are
complied with, other than:

(i) any requirement to obtain the consent of, or consult with, a member of the Group in
relation to such transfer, which consent or consultation shall not be required; and

(ii) to the extent to which all the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors provide cash cover
for any letter of credit, the consent of the relevant letter of credit issuing bank relating
to such transfer;

the Senior Facility Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, is paid an amount equal to the
aggregate of:

(i) any amounts provided as cash cover by the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors for any
letter of credit (as envisaged in paragraph (ii)(B) above);

(ii) all of the Senior Lender Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all
amounts that would have been payable under the Senior Facilities Agreement if the
Senior Facilities were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that
payment; and

all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Senior Facility Agent and/or the
Senior Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

as a result of that transfer, the Senior Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a
Debtor under the Senior Facilities finance documents;

an indemnity is provided from each of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors (other than any
Senior Agent) or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders in a form
reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and
liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender in consequence of any sum
received or recovered by any Senior Lender from any person being required (or it being alleged
that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender for any reason;

the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
except that each Senior Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date
of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary
action to authorize the making by it of that transfer; and


-----

the Senior Parent Creditors have not exercised their rights to purchase as described under the
provisions set out in the paragraph captioned “—Payment Obligations and Capitalization of
_Interest Continue—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors” or, having exercised such_
rights, have not failed to complete the acquisition of the relevant Senior Secured Liabilities in
accordance with such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a Senior Lender
Liabilities transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of the hedging agreements in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, no Senior Lender Liabilities transfer may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors), the Senior Facility Agent
shall notify that Senior Agent of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such transfer.

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, the Parent shall not make (and shall

of Senior Parent Notes or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may receive from the Parent or any other
members of the Group, any Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other than certain amounts due to the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee for its own account, payments funded by amounts not received from another member of the Group
or payments funded by Permitted Parent Financing Debt) if:

#### • a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or 

 • an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture and/or
any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (a “Senior Event of Default”) (other than a Senior
Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which
any of the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor
Representative (together, the “Senior Agents”) delivers a payment stop notice (a “Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Event of
Default to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Senior Parent Agents (as defined below) until
the earliest of:

##### • the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; 

 • in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent
Financing Liabilities, if a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect
at any time after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice, the date on which
that Senior Parent Standstill Period expires;

##### • the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default has been remedied or waived
in accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

##### • the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Senior Parent
Agents (as defined below) cancelling the Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;


-----

##### • the Senior Discharge Date; and 

 • the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior
Parent Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

##### • Unless the Senior Parent Agents (as defined below) waive this requirement, (i) a new
Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days
have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice, and (ii) no Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior
Agent in reliance on a Senior Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that
Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior
Agents to issue a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No
Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified
to the Senior Agents at the time at which an earlier Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing
Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Parent Notes Indenture
or any Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment
in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents; or (ii) the
issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

**_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_**

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall
continue to accrue) under the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by
the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to
_Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted_
at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any
Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

at any time following the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Parent Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Document and which would have been Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that
Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which
may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Parent Enforcement
Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any
further action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the Parent and the other Debtors may
amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing
Documents in accordance with their terms at any time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:


-----

no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the
enforcement of any security; and

no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation
to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of any member of the
Group under the Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing
Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement,”
_provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent the_
Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

#### • in relation to any liabilities: 

##### • the acceleration of any liabilities or the making of any declaration that any liabilities
are prematurely due and payable (other than as a result of it becoming unlawful for a
Senior Secured Creditor or a Senior Parent Creditor to perform its obligations under,
or of any voluntary or mandatory prepayment arising under, any of the debt
documents);

##### • the making of any declaration that any liabilities are payable on demand; 

 • the making of a demand in relation to a liability that is payable on demand;

guarantee liabilities of that member of the Group;

##### • the exercise of any right to require any member of the Group to acquire any liability
including exercising any put or call option against any member of the Group for the
redemption or purchase of any liability but excluding any such right which arises as a
result of the permitted debt purchase transactions provisions of the Senior Facilities
Agreement (or any other similar or equivalent provision of any of the Senior Facilities
finance documents, the Senior Notes finance documents, the Permitted Senior
Financing Documents, the hedging agreements regulated by the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or the Permitted Parent
Financing Documents (the “Secured Debt Documents”)) and/or any other acquisition
of liabilities, acquisition or transaction which any member of the Group is not
prohibited from entering into by the terms of the Secured Debt Documents and
excluding any mandatory offer arising as a result of a change of control or asset sale
(howsoever described) as set out in the Senior Notes finance documents or the Senior
Parent Notes finance documents (or any other similar or equivalent provision of any
of the Secured Debt Documents);

##### • the exercise of any right of set-off, account combination or payment netting against
any member of the Group in respect of any liabilities other than the exercise of any
such right:

##### • as close-out netting by a Hedge Counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender; 

 • as payment netting by a Hedge Counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender; 

 • as inter-hedging agreement netting by a Hedge Counterparty; 

 • as inter-hedging ancillary document netting by a hedging ancillary lender; and/or 

 • which is otherwise permitted by the terms of any of the Secured Debt Documents, in
each case to the extent that the exercise of that right gives effect to a permitted
payment; and

##### • the suing for, commencing or joining of any legal or arbitration proceedings against
any member of the Group to recover any liabilities;


-----

#### • the premature termination or close-out of any hedging transaction under any hedging agreement,
save to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement;

#### • the taking of any steps to enforce or require the enforcement of any security (including the
crystallization of any floating charge forming part of the security),

#### • the entering into of any composition, compromise, assignment or similar arrangement with any
member of the Group which owes any liabilities, or has given any security, guarantee or
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the liabilities (other than any action
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or any debt buy-back, tender offer, exchange offer
or similar or equivalent arrangement not otherwise prohibited by the debt documents); or

#### • the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of
any liquidator, receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up,
dissolution, administration or reorganization of any member of the Group which owes any
liabilities, or has given any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in
respect of any of the liabilities, or any of such member of the Group’s total assets or any
suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such member of the Group,
or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action:

#### • the taking of any action falling above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary) to
preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the
registration of such claims before any court or governmental authority and the bringing,
supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent any loss of the right to bring, support or join
proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; or

#### • a Senior Secured Creditor or Senior Parent Creditor bringing legal proceedings against any
person solely for the purpose of: (a) obtaining injunctive relief (or any analogous remedy
outside England and Wales) to restrain any actual or putative breach of any debt document to
which it is party, (b) obtaining specific performance (other than specific performance of an
obligation to make a payment) with no claim for damages or (c) requesting judicial
interpretation of any provision of any debt document to which it is party with no claim for
damages; or

#### • bringing legal proceedings against any person in connection with any securities violation,
securities or listing regulations or common law fraud; or

#### • to the extent entitled by law, the taking of any action against any creditor (or any agent, trustee
or receiver acting on behalf of that creditor) to challenge the basis on which any sale or disposal
is to take place pursuant to the powers granted to those persons under any relevant
documentation; or

#### • any person consenting to, or the taking of any other action pursuant to or in connection with,
any merger, consolidation, reorganization or any other similar or equivalent step or transaction
initiated or undertaken by a member of the Group (or any analogous procedure or step in any
jurisdiction) that is not prohibited by the terms of the Secured Debt Documents to which it is a
party.

_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” above will
not apply if:

an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Agreement, as applicable, each a “Senior Parent Event of Default”) (the “Relevant
Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;

each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be;


-----

a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent
Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior
Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior Parent Enforcement Notice”) in
writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning
on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves a Senior Parent
Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and ending
on the earlier to occur of:

the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Parent
Standstill Period”);

the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior Parent
Guarantor”), provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this
paragraph, the Senior Parent Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation
to the Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties
against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the Parent or a particular Senior Parent Guarantor
against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of
a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of
the Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Parent Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior
Note holders) and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on any
Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts
outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the
case may be (provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as
otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity has
not been amended to fall on a date prior to the date falling seven years and six months after the
date of first utilization under the Senior Facilities Agreement).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Event of Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties and the Parent, as applicable, may take Enforcement Action under the
provisions set out in caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior
Parent Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Senior Parent Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor
Representative (the “Senior Parent Agents”) that it is enforcing security created pursuant to any Security
Document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take any action referred to
under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above against that Senior
Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the
instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such
enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_


-----

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Parent Agents (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors)
may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes or in relation to
any Permitted Senior Financing Debt which is continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security
Agent, require the transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations
in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes liabilities and the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Liabilities”) if:

that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), the Senior Notes
Indenture (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities) and any Permitted Senior Financing
Agreement (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) (as applicable);

any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the
case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), the Senior Notes Indenture (in the case of the Senior
Notes liabilities) and any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (in the case of the Permitted
Senior Financing Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the
Intercreditor Agreement;

each of the Senior Facility Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Trustee, on
behalf of the relevant Senior Note holders and the applicable Senior Creditor Representative,
on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, is paid the amounts required
under the Intercreditor Agreement;

as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Note holders and the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors have no further actual or contingent liability to the Parent or any Debtor
under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior Parent Agent)
in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by
any Senior Lender, Senior Note holder or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor in consequence
of any sum received or recovered by any such party from any person being required (or it being
alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender, Senior
Note holder or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor for any reason; and

the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
the Senior Note holders or the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, except that each of them
shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the
corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors) may
only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging
agreements regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be
made.

At the request of a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the Senior Facility Agent,
the Senior Notes Trustee and any relevant Senior Creditor Representative shall notify the Senior Parent Agents of
the foregoing payable sums in connection with such transfer.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group, any
party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in respect of liabilities owed
to that party shall, (if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent arising on the instructions of
an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the
Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets
of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the secured
parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance
with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that the liabilities of any member of the Group are discharged by way
of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the


-----

Group, any creditor which benefited from that set-off shall (if prior to a distress event, only if required by the
Security Agent arising on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and
any other relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed
to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds,” if the Security Agent or any other
secured party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities
will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually
applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an acceleration event which
is continuing, any member of the Group, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf,
to:

take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group;

demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities; and

file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to the matters
referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the Security Agent is not
entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency _Event; Filing of Claims” section_
or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the
instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security
Agent may reasonably require, although the Senior Notes Trustee and the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall be
under no obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any creditor receives or recovers from
any member of the Group:

any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement;

other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event;
_Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it_
which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress
event including as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a member of
the Group other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
member of the Group; or

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a
distress event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set
out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; or

subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of
or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance
with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group,


-----

that creditor will, subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered
by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the
amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and
any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject to receiving payment
instructions and any other relevant information the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to the amount
(if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received
or recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from
the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an Instructing
Group; or (ii) if required as set out under the third paragraph of this section, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an Instructing Group; or (ii) to
the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior Discharge Date
under the provisions under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent
_Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the_
Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or
to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each case,
an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the Security Agent shall give
effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are then entitled to
give to the Security Agent under the provisions under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent
_Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any independent power
to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the
Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions,” the Security
Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator
of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

#### • an Instructing Group; or 

 • prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph
of this “—Enforcement of Security” section, given effect to instructions given by the Majority
Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security, and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given
instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Senior Parent
Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each creditor (other than the Senior Notes Trustee and the
Senior Parent Notes Trustee) shall agree with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to
the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, preinsolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the
Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an
Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other creditor under the
Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the
due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor.

_Waiver of Rights_


-----

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the secured parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the security be
enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from
any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest, which is capable
of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then that creditor may only enforce that security
in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the
event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the Senior Discharge Date,
the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior Parent Creditors in respect of
the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that
security shall be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate
to the Debtors under general law.

**_Consultation Period_**

Subject to paragraph (d) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the Transaction Security or refrain or cease from enforcing the Transaction Security or to take
any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the Creditors represented in the Instructing
Group concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each
other Agent, Hedge Counterparty and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to
be given by the Instructing Group for a period of not less than 30 days from the date on which
details of the proposed instructions are received by such Agents, Hedge Counterparties and the
Security Agent (or such shorter period as each Agent, Hedge Counterparty and the Security
Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation
Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the Transaction Security or refrain or cease from enforcing the Transaction Security or
take any other Enforcement Action.

Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event conflicting instructions are received from any other
Instructing Group, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security, refrain or cease
from enforcing the Transaction Security or, as the case may be, take the relevant other
Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions given by an Instructing Group referred
to in paragraph (a)(i)(A) of the definition of Instructing Group (in each case provided that such
instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Transaction Security Documents) and the terms of all instructions given by any other
Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.

Prior to the Senior Lender Discharge Date, if:

(i) the Senior Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the first
Consultation Period;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the Transaction Security
(or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of
the end of the first Consultation Period; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any
enforcement of the Transaction Security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other
Enforcement Action at that time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Senior
Creditors (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any
applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security
Documents).

Subject to paragraph (c) above, no Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in
accordance with paragraph (a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any


-----

instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other
Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each case provided that such
instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Transaction Security Documents) if:

(i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event;
or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing
Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other Agent, the Hedge
Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby
delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security, and,
where this paragraph (d) applies:

(I) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or
preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of
which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation to the
matters referred to in (A) and (B) above; and

(II) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first
received.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the
subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior
Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Senior Parent Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing
Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice to
any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide
replacement security); or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or
agreement in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect
of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or
take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not
prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member
of the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor; and

any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares in a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor), or any other transaction
pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group, the
Security Agent shall promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present
and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.


-----

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the Parent shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal
or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in
accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt
Documents.

In the case of any release of security requested by the Parent pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Senior
Facilities Agreement as part of a permitted transaction under the Senior Facilities Agreement, when making that
request the Parent shall confirm to the Security Agent that:

such request is a permitted transaction request (and absent any such statement in a request for a
release the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume for all purposes that such request is not a
permitted transaction request); and

it has determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations and other
relevant considerations in relation to that permitted transaction) that it is either not possible or
not desirable to implement that permitted transaction on terms satisfactory to the Parent by
instead granting additional security and/or amending the terms of the existing security,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt
Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the need for
any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor) promptly enter into
and deliver such documentation as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release
described above.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds of
any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of the Senior
Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Notes liabilities or the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities (as applicable) (together, the “Senior Liabilities”) then no such application of those proceeds shall
require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Documents and such
application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other
discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities.

_Distressed Disposals_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group
in circumstances where the security has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Documents, (b) being effected by enforcement of security in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Documents or (c) being disposed of to a third party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of
the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
creditor or Debtor):

to release the security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable;

Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed
by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”)
will be treated as a Primary Creditor or the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate
and each of the agents, the arrangers, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Senior
Parent Creditors (each a “Secured Party”) for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part

fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to
postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to the
Parent or the Company (provided, in the case of a transfer to the Company, it will remain a subsidiary of the
Parent after the relevant Distressed Disposal), in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the
extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so
transfer those borrowing liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the request
of the Security Agent, unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to
any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and
such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate or where a financial advisor selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such
sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view.

If prior to the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes or any Permitted Parent Financing Debt, a Distressed
Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Parent Notes Guarantees and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent
Financing Debt or any security over the assets of the Parent or any Senior Parent Guarantor (including the shares
in and/or any loan to the Company) will be released and/or the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted
Parent Financing Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser
or one of its affiliates), and all security under the Security Documents in
respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and

amount if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser
or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged; and

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to
the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

_IOT Tariffs_

Inter-operator tariffs (“IOT”) discounts receivables and payables are recorded in trade receivables and trade
payables, respectively. Some of the partnerships among operators are based on gross IOTs, defined by each
operator through its AA.14 tariff list. Some roaming revenue and costs are invoiced and paid on a monthly basis
based on AA.14 tariffs. Each operator defines with its partners a net IOT amount based on discounted tariffs (“IOT
discounts”), which is renegotiated on a regular basis. IOT discounts are accrued on a monthly basis and settled
bilaterally by way of credit notes for the difference between AA.14 tariffs and the net IOT amount agreed, with
any remaining credit notes settled through payments at some point in the future.

As of March 31, 2023, the net IOT and roaming payable totaled CHF 28.4 million. The difference between net
tariffs and tariffs invoiced has significantly reduced over the years, and the overall balance relates mostly to
previous years. We will continue to repay IOTs balances in the coming years.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the CHF100,000,000 million aggregate principal amount of     % Senior
Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Matterhorn Telecom S.A., a société anonyme
organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the “Issuer”), and unconditionally guaranteed on
a senior secured basis by its direct parent, Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A. (the “Company”), and its subsidiary
Salt Mobile SA (“Salt”).

In this “Description of the Notes,” the “Issuer” refers only to Matterhorn Telecom S.A., and any successor obligor
to Matterhorn Telecom S.A. on the Notes, and not to any of its subsidiaries or to its parent, the Company. The
proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used, together with cash on balance sheet, by
the Issuer to redeem in part, on or after September 15, 2023 and in any event on or prior to September 15, 2024,
the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and to pay fees, costs and expenses payable in connection
therewith and in connection with this offering, in all cases as set forth in this offering memorandum under the
caption “Use of Proceeds.”

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the
Company (the “Parent Guarantee”) and Salt. Any Guarantors that are Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined below)
of the Issuer are referred to herein as “Subsidiary Guarantors” and each guarantee provided by such a Subsidiary
Guarantor, a “Subsidiary Guarantee.”

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) among, inter
_alios, the Issuer, the Company, Salt and Kroll Trustee Services Ltd., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be_
issued in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act and are not subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The
Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference or otherwise or be subject to any
provision of the Trust Indenture Act. The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents and refers to
the Intercreditor Agreement and does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement,
respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You
should read the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents in their entirety. Copies of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents are available upon request at the Paying

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue CHF 100,000,000 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature
on       , 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples
of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
SIX SIS. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in
arrears on        and        of each year, commencing on      , 2024, to holders of record on the Business
Day immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most
recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period
shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. The interest amount will be calculated by
applying the applicable rate to the aggregate principal outstanding of the Notes.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted_
to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes, except in respect of any of
the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee (“Additional
Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes have been issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than denominations of CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes.


-----

Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other series of Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series; _provided, however, that any Additional Notes that are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax_
purposes with the Notes will be issued with a unique ISIN and/or other identifying number. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes”
shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional
Notes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (defined below)
owing in respect of the Global Note to the applicable Paying Agent, who will then, in turn, make such payments
to SIX SIS, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its customary procedures.

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global Note
will be paid to holders of interests in the Notes through SIX SIS in CHF.

**Paying Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes and, in connection with
the listing on the Exchange, a paying agent in Switzerland.

Upon the written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent for the Notes without prior notice
to the Holders of the Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be represented by a global note in bearer form without interest coupons attached (the “Global
Note”). On the Issue Date, the Global Note will be deposited by the Issuing Agent with SIX SIS as recognized
intermediary for such purposes by SIS Swiss Exchange for the entire duration of the Notes and until their complete
redemption.

Each holder of Notes (the “Holders” and, individually, a “Holder”) shall have a quotal co-ownership interest in
the Global Note to the extent of its claim against the Issuer (“Book-Entry Interests”), provided that for so long as
the Global Note remains deposited with SIX SIS, the co-ownership interest shall be suspended and so long as the
Notes are intermediated securities,the Notes may only be transferred by the entry of the transferred Notes in a
securities account of the transferee.

The records of SIX SIS will determine the number of Notes held through each participant in SIX SIS. In respect
of Notes held in the form of intermediated securities, the Holders will be the persons holding the Notes in a
securities account which is in their name, or in case of intermediaries, the intermediaries holding the Notes for
their own account in a securities account which is in their name.

The conversion of the Global Note into uncertificated securities or individually certificated securities is excluded.
Neither the Issuer nor the Holders shall at any time have the right to effect or demand the conversion of the Global
Note into, or the delivery of uncertificated securities or individually certificated securities.

Individually certificated securities may only be printed, in whole, but not in part, if the Issuing Agent determines,
in its sole discretion, that the printing of such individually certificated securities is necessary or useful. Should the
Issuing Agent so determine, it shall provide for the printing of the individually certificated securities without cost
to the Holders.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of book-entry interests in the Global
Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with SIX SIS, as applicable, or persons who hold interests
through SIX SIS, as applicable, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted
during such period unless such resale or transfer is made in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair
your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form,
Holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose. If
printed, the Notes shall be documented by individually certificated securities with no coupons attached in the
principal amount of CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof and shall be executed
by affixing thereon the facsimile signatures of two authorized officers of the Issuer. The individually certificated


-----

securities will not be issued in bearer form, but exclusively in registered form for US tax purposes whereby, inter
alia, title exclusively by registration of the Holders in a register (the “Register”) to be established and maintained
by a registrar (the “Registrar”) appointed by the Issuer and acting on its behalf after consultation with the Issuing
Agent. In the case individually certificated securities are delivered, the entry of the Notes in the Issuer’s register
of uncertificated securities will be cancelled and Notes in the form of individually certificated securities shall be
delivered instead to the Holders, who for this purpose need to be registered in the Register, against cancellation
of the intermediated securities in their respective securities accounts. Notes documented by individually
certificated securities shall not be included in the records of SIX SIS or any other clearing system or any other
intermediary and, therefore shall not constitute intermediated securities.

The registration of a new Holder by the Registrar will only occur upon presentation of the relevant individually
certificated securities at the specified office of the Registrar. No transfer of such individually certificated securities
will be valid unless and until entered into the Register. Individually certificated securities may be registered only
in the name of and transferred to a named person.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Principal Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note
as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Company will be permitted to
designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Notes Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of
Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by
the Company and each material subsidiary of the Company that is a guarantor under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement (each a “Guarantor” and such guarantee, a “Notes Guarantee”).

The initial Guarantors, the type of Guarantee and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation will be as follows:

Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A. Parent Guarantee Luxembourg

Salt Mobile SA Subsidiary Guarantee Switzerland

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors that will guarantee the Notes represented 99.2%
of the Group’s EBITDA and 99.0% of the Group’s revenue. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Parent Guarantor’s direct or indirect subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes (Salt (Liechtenstein) AG and
Salt Services S.A.) generated 0.8% of the Group’s EBITDA and 1.0% of the Group’s revenue.

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that
guarantees the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter
into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2027 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the 2026 Euro Senior Secured Notes,
the Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions
on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or
other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles
to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The Swiss collateral is subject to_


-----

_hardening periods and the Swiss Guarantee is subject to fraudulent transfer (avoidance actions)”_ _and_ “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and Switzerland_
_may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.”_

**_Release of Notes Guarantees_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:

(1) except in the case of the Parent Guarantee, a sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer
(including by way of consolidation, merger, amalgamation or combination) of ownership
interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does
not remain a Restricted Subsidiary or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

(2) except in the case of the Parent Guarantee, the designation in accordance with the Indenture of
the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest, all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued
under the Indenture or discharge and defeasance thereof, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) except in the case of the Parent Guarantee, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally
released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement;

(5) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(8) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation”; or_

(9) with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor
pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer
or a Guarantor.

Substantially all the operations of the Company (and the Issuer) are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Notes
Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors). As of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, the total liabilities
of the Company and the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes were immaterial. Although the
Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries,
the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any
limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into on or prior to the Issue Date, each of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, as applicable, has granted or will grant in favor of Kroll Trustee Services Ltd. as security agent (the
“Security Agent”) liens and security interests on an equal and ratable first-priority basis, subject to the operation
of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over those
of its assets listed below:

shares of capital stock of each of Salt and the Issuer;


-----

certain bank accounts; and

certain intragroup receivables (together the “Initial Collateral”),

_provided that counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the_
security in priority to holders of the Notes.

In addition, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, any and all assets
in which a security interest will be granted after the Issue Date pursuant to any Security Document to secure the
obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and/or any Notes Guarantee are, together with the Initial Collateral, the
“Collateral.”

All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral
Liens.

The Collateral will be granted in favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes on the Issue
Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not perfected) to secure the Notes
in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

#### • if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders; 

 • if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of a Guarantor
in a particular category of assets, only the material assets in that category will be subject to
security;

#### • if providing such security requires consent before such assets may be secured or where
providing such security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any
rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Company, the Issuer or any of their Subsidiaries in
respect of those assets or require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their
interests and where (subject to certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained
after the use of reasonable endeavors;

#### • if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory limitations,
financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules or
similar matters or providing security would be outside the applicable pledgor’s capacity or
conflict with fiduciary duties of directors or cause material risk of personal or criminal liability
after the use of reasonable endeavors to overcome such prohibitions (if possible);

#### • if in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets;

#### • if providing such security would have a material adverse effect (as reasonably determined in
good faith by such Subsidiary) on the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct its operations and
business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture and any requirement
under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other
action shall be subject to this principle;

#### • no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a Guarantor is not located but
perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Guarantor in relation to security
granted by another Guarantor located in a different jurisdiction and (where otherwise consistent
with the Agreed Security Principles) in any supra-national registries agreed between the
Company and the Security Agent from time to time;

#### • in the case of bank accounts, if providing such security or perfecting liens thereon would require
giving notice to the banks with whom the accounts are maintained, such notice will only be
provided after the Notes are accelerated; and

#### • in the case of receivables, notification of receivables security to debtors and of security over
goods held by third parties will only be provided after the Notes are accelerated, subject to
certain exceptions.


-----

The Collateral also secures, on an equal and ratable basis, the liabilities under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement, the 2027 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the 2026 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining 2024 Euro
Senior Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes. Subject to certain conditions,
including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,”
the Company and the Guarantors are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future
issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in
each case, as permitted under the Indenture.

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. The enforcement of the Security
Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the
Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law
limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_
_and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”_
_and_ “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and
_Switzerland may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.” In addition, the_
enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security
Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations,
the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes
Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may_
_be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in
possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the Security
Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the
issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the payment of obligations under the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2027 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the 2026 Euro Senior Secured Notes, the
Remaining 2024 Euro Senior Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale
of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be
disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Trustee for the Notes has, and the Indenture will provide that by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have:

#### • irrevocably appointed Kroll Trustee Services Ltd., as Security Agent to act as its agent under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including,
without limitation, the Security Documents);

#### • irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or
other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents),
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document,
waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the
Security Agent on its behalf; and

#### • accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have
authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee and the Holders under the
Indenture and (d) the trustee and the holders under the 2019 Indenture and the 2017 Indenture, is established by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under
the Notes and the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement will receive proceeds of enforcement of security over the
Collateral only after the claims of certain Hedging Obligations are satisfied. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or_
Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure
other Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, the creditors under such Indebtedness will receive proceeds
from an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Trustee and the Holders under the Indenture. See “—
_Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—_
_Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will take any action required to effectuate any release of Liens over the property and other
assets constituting Collateral required by a Security Document:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued
under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(2) upon release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture (with respect to the Liens
securing such Guarantee granted by such Guarantor), the release of the property, assets and
Capital Stock of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other
than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject
to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) that is permitted by the Indenture (with_
respect to the Lien on such Collateral) or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,
_provided that this clause (3)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock,_
obligations under proceeds loans owed to the Issuer, or accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except, in
the case of accounts receivable, to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and
assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following
such transfer, sale or disposal;

(4) if the Company designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the
release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest”;_

(6) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge
thereof);

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(9) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers—; and

(10) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection
with a solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of
the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and the Trustee without the consent of the Holders.


-----

The Company, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may also, among other things, without any release or
consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral,
including, without limitation, (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related
transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security Documents which has become worn out, defective
or obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; and (iii) any other action permitted by the
Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that
is permitted to share in the Collateral (and which the Company elects shall share in the Collateral), the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall, at the request of the Company, enter into with the Company, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or more
intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the
Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable to the Holders) and substantially similar
as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security;
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or_
the Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the
Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee such documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably
require. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such
Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for
equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral
Liens or to implement a pushdown in relation to an IPO Event in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or
(6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders of Notes in any
material. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted
by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights,
duties, liabilities indemnification or immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, any amendments referenced in the preceding paragraph and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to the
Holders upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business
Day upon prior written request at the office of the Issuer and at the offices of the Paying Agent.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not redeemable at the
option of the Issuer.


-----

At any time prior to      , 2025, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders of the Notes (with a copy to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the relevant
Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after      , 2025, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part,
at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest
to, but not including, the redemption date:

**Twelve month period commencing in:** **Percentage**

2025 ........................................................................................................................................... %

2026 ........................................................................................................................................... %

2027 and thereafter .................................................................................................................... %

At any time and from time to time prior to      , 2025, the Issuer may redeem the Notes with the net cash
proceeds received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to      % plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to
exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (excluding any Additional Notes with terms
and conditions that are not identical to the terms and conditions of the Notes), provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes being redeemed (excluding any
principal amount of any Additional Notes with terms and conditions that are not identical to the
terms and conditions of the Notes) remain outstanding immediately thereafter.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation
of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived by the Issuer (provided, however, that, in
any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given),
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded (no later than the business day prior to such
redemption date) in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Issuer
by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or
the Notes to the contrary, redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. In
addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included in an
Officer’s Certificate), the Paying Agent will distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the
redemption date; provided that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer
of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt,
the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will not include any
negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the
Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders
holding interests as a participant of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the
clearing system. No Trustee, Paying Agent or other applicable party shall be required to incur any costs, fees or
expenses (except as expressly agreed in writing) in relation to such distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the


-----

Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to
the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding,
such redemption date.

In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the
Notes, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate
of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or
other offer, as applicable.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on SIX Swiss
Exchange (the “Exchange”) and the rules of the Authority so require, inform the listing authority of such optional
redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately
after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be
made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender
or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the
Issuer or any such Affiliate may determine. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, including the 2017 Indenture, the 2019 Indenture, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by the Issuer may be funded by the
use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under
our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate,
may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of
debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) will
select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis provided, however, that no Note of CHF 150,000 in aggregate
principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 will be
redeemed (or, in the case of Notes issued as a Global Note, based on a method that most nearly approximates a
_pro rata selection (such as by way of pool factor) in accordance with the then applicable procedures of the relevant_
clearing system), unless otherwise required by law, clearing system or depositary requirements. Neither the
Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this
paragraph.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, any such notice to the
Holders of the relevant Notes shall, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, be notified to the
Authority and, in addition to such release, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption
date, the Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.


-----

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Issuer (as defined below) may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time
upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior written notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice
will be irrevocable), with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a
“Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if
the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or the relevant Guarantor determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation;

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), or

(3) the use of proceeds being determined to be a harmful “use of proceeds in Switzerland” as
interpreted by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration for purposes of Swiss Withholding Tax (a
“Harmful Use of Proceeds”) in the 90 day period from the Issue Date,

the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or the relevant Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Issuer, the Successor Issuer or the relevant Guarantor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and would not cause
the Issuer to incur additional out-of-pocket costs, but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment
with respect to the Notes). For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable measures do not include changing the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer or any Successor Issuer. In the case of redemption due to withholding
as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this
Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this Offering
Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction
that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax
Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless
the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of the Successor Issuer or the predecessor of a
successor of a Guarantor. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of
redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer, a Successor Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect
of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Issuer or Successor Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that
it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent
to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor has or have been or will become
obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law or a Harmful Use of Proceeds. The
Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is incorporated
or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.


-----

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or any Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Notes or the Notes
Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes
unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for,
or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Luxembourg or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having
power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made
by a Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, resident for tax purposes,
or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or Notes Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with
such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect
of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant
Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment or a dependent agent in, or being physically present in,
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely
from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect
thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after
reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim
or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by
applicable law, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with
respect to the Notes;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, excise, use, transfer, personal property or similar
Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is
permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would
have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting
payment from, another paying agent;

(6) any Tax that is imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or
other official guidance thereunder, any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection
therewith, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement
between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to any of the foregoing or
any agreements entered into pursuant to section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(7) any combination of the above.


-----

Such Additional Amounts also will not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant payment was first made
available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1)
to (7) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or
a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes
directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary
course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such
certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made
available at the offices of the Issuer.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note
or Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and
the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders
on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises, or the Payor becomes
aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver
such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The
Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other property or similar Taxes
that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture,
the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange
of the Notes), excluding any such Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations
of this paragraph will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis
_mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is organized or any political subdivision or taxing_
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all or part (equal to CHF 150,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in
excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the
Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “—Change of Control” section in the event
and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under “—
_Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._


-----

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that_
is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each
Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right
to require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change
of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of a Global Note, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Note in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of definitive registered Notes, if any, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all definitive registered Notes, if any, accepted for purchase by the
Issuer.

If any definitive registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly deliver by bank transfer to
each Holder of definitive registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the
Trustee or its authenticating agent will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each
Holder of definitive registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion
of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that
is at least CHF 150,000 and integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the
Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to
repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking
to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control
Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by


-----

such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described
above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes that remain
outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, as
applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the
Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other
offer, as applicable.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules)
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Notes, under the Change
of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued
by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions.

Under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the
repayment of such debt. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing
Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase
upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase
the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself
does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and Our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to_
_repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_
_Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you_
_protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is
limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is less than 5.0 to 1.0.

in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company

the case may be;

of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (B) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that at the
time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Company would have been able to Incur
CHF 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving
_pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant_

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement
shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of
this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant;

(2) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second
paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (7), (11) or (12) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;


-----

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will
be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(8) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” of this covenant, Consolidated
EBITDA shall be measured for the period of the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters
ending prior to such date for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Company
are available; and for purpose of any calculation under this covenant, Indebtedness shall be
measured at the option of the Company on the most recent date on which new commitments are
obtained or the date upon which Indebtedness is incurred (in the case of revolving facilities);

(9) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts
previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar
provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid
periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of the covenant described under this
“Limitation on Indebtedness” to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first
Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(10) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when
measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any
amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any
premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(11) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or
commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to paragraph (25) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,”
the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including without
limitation for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or borrowings and re-borrowings under any of
clauses (1) through (17) (inclusive) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant
(and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
will, at the Company’s option, either: (A) be determined on the date of such revolving credit
facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof
has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
and, if the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio,
as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such
time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under the covenant described
under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” irrespective of the Consolidated Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision
of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters
of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed
or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a
date pursuant to the operation of this sub-paragraph (A) shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such paragraph(s)); or (B) be determined on the date such amount is
borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment; provided that the Company
may revoke such determination made pursuant to this paragraph (11) at any time and from time
to time; and

(12) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance
on any provision of the second paragraph of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of_
Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction
to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of


-----

such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to
be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender
premiums), defeasance costs, indemnity fees, upfront fees, any required tax gross-up amounts
and other costs, fees and expenses in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change of IFRS to U.S. GAAP, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” (and in the case of Indebtedness that constitutes the payment of interest in the form of additional_
Indebtedness shall be permitted to be secured by a Lien to the same extent as the Indebtedness to which the
payment of interest relates). The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as
specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any CHF-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the CHF Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness (except with respect to Existing Facility B, which amount is set at
CHF 555 million CHF Equivalent), or, at the option of the Company, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness
Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than CHF, and such refinancing would cause the applicable CHFdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such CHF-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of
such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the CHF Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement
with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately
thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Company is not able to Incur an additional CHF 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to

made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted
Payments permitted below by clauses (5) of the second succeeding paragraph, but
excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding
paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

-----

or trust established by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for
the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into
or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified
Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
(plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or
marketable securities, received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
upon such conversion or exchange);

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries resulting from:

Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans
or advances or other transfers of assets (including by way of
dividend, distribution, interest payments or returns of capital) to the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted
Subsidiaries (valued, in each case, as provided in the definition of
“Investment”) not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted
Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this clause (iv), was
included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments
referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c); provided, however,
that no amount will be included in Consolidated EBITDA for
purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the
Company’s option) included under this clause (iv); and

Subsidiary of the Company; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
Affiliate to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided,_ _however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the preceding_
clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Company’s option) included under this clause (v); _provided further,_
_however, that such amount shall not exceed the amount included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted_
Payments referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be
included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to subclause (ii) or (iii) of
the preceding clause (C) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of net cash
proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an
event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose and
effect of the receipt of such net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of
Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such net cash proceeds or property or
assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements


-----

of the Indenture; provided that, Excluded Amounts shall be limited to the amount of net cash proceeds or property
or assets or marketable securities necessary to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio to cause the occurrence
of a Specified Change of Control Event, and amounts of net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable
securities received in excess thereof shall not constitute Excluded Amounts.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Company.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Capital
Stock, Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or
Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the
exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the
issuance of fractional shares) for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of,
Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares),
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity
(other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or
through an Excluded Contribution) of the Company; provided, however, that to the extent so
applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value (as determined in accordance with the
preceding sentence) of property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital
Stock, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause
(c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially
concurrent sale of, Refinancing Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above;

(3) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Preferred

(14) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the fair

Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment does not exceed 4.25 to 1.0.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through (18) above, or is permitted pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to (i) classify
such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment in any manner that complies with this
covenant or (ii) later reclassify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of
any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted
Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the
Company acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income
or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to


-----

Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount (as defined
below) of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute
such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Existing Senior
Facilities Agreement) or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or
entered into on the Issue Date, including the 2019 Indenture and the 2017 Indenture;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating
to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which
such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which
such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection
with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; _provided_ that, for the purposes of this
clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing
of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which


-----

such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in
good faith by the Company), or that the Company determines when such Indebtedness is
Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict
the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or
other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase,
sale or other agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is
a party entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;
_provided that such encumbrance relates solely to the property or assets of the Company_
or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights
arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or
property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of
another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint
venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers,
suppliers or landlords under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements
or Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Existing
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, together with the security
documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date, or (ii) in comparable financings
(as determined in good faith by the Company) or where the Company determines when such
Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;


-----

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value
to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such
Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted
Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person
assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness)
received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of
cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is directly or
indirectly applied by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or
is required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), to prepay,
repay or purchase (A) any Indebtedness of a non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary (in
each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary)
or (B) or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); (ii) to
prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of
the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase; (iii) to purchase the Notes
through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices
(which may be below par), or make an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date); (iv) to redeem Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption”; or (v) purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth_
below for an Asset Disposition Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset
Disposition Offer for purposes thereof); provided, however, that, in connection with
the prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness (other than the Notes or any
revolving Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Revolving Credit
Facility)), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness
and will cause the related commitments (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to
the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to (i) invest in or
commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) make capital expenditure, in each
case within 425 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_ _however, that any such_
reinvestment in Additional Assets or capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive
binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the


-----

Company that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement,
so long as such investment or capital expenditure is consummated within 180 days of
such 425th day; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided_ that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or
clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise
invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the
Indenture. On the 426th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Company elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of CHF 85.0 million and 15.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA, the Company will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari
Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at
an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an
offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum denominations of CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF
1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained
in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in CHF, including the Notes, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate
principal amounts into their CHF Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the
Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount
of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes will not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Company will purchase the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari Passu
Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if
less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on
a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF 1,000
in excess thereof. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The
Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business
Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes
an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder,
and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the


-----

Global Note), and the Trustee or its authenticating agent, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the
Company, will authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by bookentry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the
Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum
denomination of CHF 150,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by
book-entry) by the Company to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Company or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor)
and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset
Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary
are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of CHF 140.0 million and 25.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being
measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions
of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules)
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict. The Issuer
may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset
Disposition offer prior to the expiration of the 365-day (or 545-day, as applicable) period mentioned in this
covenant.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any
service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of
the greater of CHF 56.0 million and 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained
in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an
Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
CHF 112.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have
been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. If there are no

Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in
this covenant if the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a
letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favorable to the Company
or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—

the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted

(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses

each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to
the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board
of Directors or the Senior Management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary,
or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such
time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or
among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an
Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the

-----

or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such

is being offered generally to other investors that are not Affiliates on the same or more favorable
terms and (iii) in the case of securities, the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue
amount of such securities, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, so long as such
transaction is with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders) and such
Affiliates are treated no more favorable than all other holders of such class generally;

Restricted Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
or entered into with any Business Successor, in each case, that the Company determines in good
faith is either fair to the Company or otherwise on customary terms for such type of
arrangements in connection with similar transactions.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year beginning with the first fiscal year
ending after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following
information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company or its predecessor as of the
end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and
statements of cash flow of the Company or its predecessor for the two most recent fiscal years,
including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available),
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal
year, provided that such pro forma financial information need not comply with the requirements
of Regulation S-X; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital
resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and
critical accounting policies; (d) description of the business, management and shareholders of
the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual
arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors
and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Company beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2019, all quarterly reports of the
Company containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and
cash flow for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (b) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement information and balance sheet
information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision
of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter, _provided_ that such pro forma financial
information need not comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X; (c) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of
operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources
of the Company, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in
commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material recent
developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any
senior executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any
other material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly,
a report containing a description of such event.

Within 10 Business Days after the delivery of each report required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of
this covenant, the Company will conduct a conference call to discuss such report and results of operations for the
relevant reporting period.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect
on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented; _provided,_ _however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and_
(3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such
periods. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries
of the Company. The filing of an annual report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in (1) will satisfy
such provision.


-----

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of
the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case
may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an
unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation
shall include the following items: revenues, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders
equity, capital expenditure and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post
copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Company in
good faith) or (b) to the extent the Company determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available
in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially
reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes.
The Company will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first
paragraph of this covenant at the offices of the Paying Agent or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, post such reports on the official website of the Exchange.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of (x) a direct or indirect Parent of the Company or (y) any report
or financial statements of a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company that represents substantially all the assets
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (any entity under sub-clause (x) or (y), a “Financial Reporting
_Entity”), in each case (if such entity is different from the Company) so long as such reports (if an annual or_
quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of
this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to such Financial Reporting Entity and (b)
include (i) in the case of sub-clause (x), condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (A) such Parent; (B) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (C) any
other Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (D) consolidating adjustments; and (E) the total
consolidated amounts and (ii) in the case of sub-clause (y), a brief unaudited description of material differences
between the financial statements of the Financial Reporting Entity and the Company shall be included in such
report or financial statements. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Company or any Parent or IPO Entity
are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Paris Stock Exchange or the SIX Swiss Exchange) and the Company or such
Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards applicable to issuers of equity securities
admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to
issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, the Paris Stock Exchange or the SIX Swiss Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Company will
make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or
such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange pursuant to such
Admission and Disclosure Standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated
markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Paris Stock Exchange or the SIX Swiss Exchange, as applicable).
Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that (i) such requirements require the Issuer or
any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, the Paris Stock Exchange or the SIX Swiss Exchange, as applicable, and (ii) the Company
provides quarterly earnings report for the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year to the
Trustee, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_


-----

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its
assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of
America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture
and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Security Documents (and, to the extent required
by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(3) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture
(if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on
an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1) and
(2) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer
under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not
be released from its obligations under such Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—The Company”
and “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding
the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer
may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose
of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant) will
not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a parent of one or more of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries.

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all
its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Company)
will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in


-----

form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the
Indenture and the Parent Guarantee and (b) all obligations of the Company under the Security
Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at
the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional CHF 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case,
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of
clauses (2) and (3) above.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to
be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and
assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described above under “—The Issuer” and
below under “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and,
other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the paragraph described under “—The
_Company” in this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine_
with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary
may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any
other Restricted Subsidiary and (c) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the Refinancing.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this
sentence), the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company, reincorporating the Company in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant) will
not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_


-----

No Subsidiary Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless

(a) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction); or

(b) (i) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantee and the Security Documents (and, to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(ii) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and
is continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary)) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3)(b)(ii) and the provisions described above under “—The Issuer” and “—
_The Company” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may_
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Subsidiary
Guarantor and (b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer
all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding
clause (3)(B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor
may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose
of changing the legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to) any Permitted Reorganization.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing
until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Guarantees,” “Impairment of Security_
_Interest” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and_
_Consolidation—The Company,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be_
effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any
related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event
ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Company
properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no default will be
deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On
the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified,
at the Company’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the
extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving
effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the
extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on


-----

the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture applicable in connection with any
transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any Incurrence or assumption of
Indebtedness or Liens, the making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, any Asset
Disposition, any acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination, any transaction
requiring the testing of any basket based on the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company, and in determining
whether a Change of Control constitutes a Specified Change of Control Event), the date of determination of such
basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Company, be the date the definitive
agreements for such transaction are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma
adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definitions of
Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such transaction and other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the
ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or
ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of
the Issuer or that arise from an asset or a target company subject to such transaction) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation
of such transaction or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at
the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are
entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the
date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction. To the extent the date of determination
of a basket or ratio is tested prior to the date of consummation of a transaction, such basket or ratio shall be deemed
utilized to the same extent until the earlier of the date of consummation of such transaction or the date such
transaction is terminated or expires without consummation, except that in the case of an acquisition, merger or
consolidation, any calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or
Liens or the making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not
reflect such transaction until it has been consummated.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly or
indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (or other Indebtedness
that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”) or Public Debt in whole or in part unless such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the_
date on which such other Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Notes Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu_ with such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Future guarantees granted pursuant to this provision may be released in accordance with the Notes Guarantees
release provisions in the Indenture. In addition, future guarantees of the Notes granted pursuant to this provision
shall be released at the option of the Company upon such Guarantor being unconditionally released and
discharged from its liability with respect to the Indebtedness giving rise to the requirement to provide such Note
Guarantee, so long as no other Indebtedness guaranteed by, or incurred by, the relevant Guarantor would have
required that such Guarantor provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture immediately after
the release of such Note Guarantee.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Notes Guarantee.

Each additional Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee could reasonably be
expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such
Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes)
other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph
undertaken in connection with, such Notes Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of
this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security
interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall not,
and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit
of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any
of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens”; provided, that the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant
entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged,
transferred or released in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented
or otherwise modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for
Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) for purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization
or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and Consolidation”; (v) make any other
change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; or (vi) to amend, extend, renew,
restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release any Security Documents followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets; provided, however, that in the case of clauses
(v) and (vi) above (except where permitted by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the benefit of the
Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the Indenture), no Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless
contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement or modification or
release, the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, reasonably
satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or
investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant
Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Liens after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an
opinion of counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), reasonably
satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under
the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and
replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new
Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent will (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.


-----

**_IPO Pushdown_**

At the option of the Company, on, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Company shall be entitled
to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on
the basis that (unless otherwise set out in the Pushdown Notice):

(1) references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply
only to the IPO Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time (or the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, if so elected), although, save as otherwise
permitted by the Indenture, the Company shall remain the same entity;

(2) all financial ratio, basket calculations, financial definitions and financial ratio calculations shall
exclude any holding company of the IPO Entity and any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the
IPO Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Entity (or as
otherwise permitted by the Indenture);

(3) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to a holding company of the Company or a holding company of the
IPO Entity and any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO Entity performing a particular
role or acting in a particular capacity shall (unless specified otherwise in the Pushdown Notice)
be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context
requires otherwise) and provided that nothing in this paragraph (a), including the deeming
construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO Entity prior
to such designation, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a
breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default;

(4) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default
in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or
the Security Documents or otherwise shall apply to any Person of which the IPO Entity is
Subsidiary or any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Guarantor or otherwise) (or to the IPO Entity, if so elected);

(5) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity or any
Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or
otherwise) (or to the IPO Entity, if so elected) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an
Event of Default;

(6) each holding company of the IPO Entity and any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO
Entity, shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under and in
connection with the Indenture (including any Guarantee), the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by it or any holding company of
it; and

(7) unless otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement and which is a holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement and all obligations and restrictions
under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Company that person
shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement and shall have no further rights or
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement); (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement
for any person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement); and (C) any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any
other agreement which requires or assumes that any person be a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or that any liabilities or obligations be
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise
subordinated shall cease to apply.

A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
(disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this provision).

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment or supplement to the Indenture
or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or


-----

the Security Documents or any other agreement or instrument required by the Company and/or take such other
action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first
paragraph, _provided that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument will not impose any_
personal obligations on the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto or adversely affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee, the Security Agent or any other agents
party thereto under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. The Trustee, the
Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the holders
of the Notes (without any consent by the holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended, release or
replacement documents and/or take any other such action on behalf of the holders (and shall do so on the request
of and at the cost of the Company).

For the purpose of this covenant and the Indenture, the “IPO Entity” shall be the Company (or any Affiliate), any
direct or indirect parent entity of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or any successor of any such Person)
as notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Entity in relation to the
relevant IPO Event, provided that (i) the IPO Entity shall be an entity which will issue shares, or whose shares are
to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a holding company thereof) and (ii) a Subsidiary of the Company may
not be designated as the IPO Entity unless the Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of such IPO Entity.

If a Pushdown Notice is delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph above in relation to a contemplated
IPO Event, the Person who delivered that Pushdown Notice shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at
any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any
Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (i) to (vii) of
the first paragraph above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been
released pursuant to first paragraph above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Security Agent
by prior written notice to the Company and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect
of that security; and (iii) if any person party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as a “Investor”] has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (vii)
of the first paragraph above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written notice
to the Company and that Person, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in the fourth paragraph above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
Company from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and
(B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any other document or instrument or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any
action or step taken by any person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown
Notice was effective or otherwise).

“IPO Event” means the occurrence of an Initial Public Offering or a Listing.

“IPO Pushdown” means the transactions and arrangements contemplated by “—Certain Covenants— IPO
_Pushdown.”_

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written
notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% (or more) in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;


-----

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created
after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default provision”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”);_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates CHF 60.0 million
or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, the Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final
judgments aggregating in excess of CHF 70.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent
insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged
or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value
in excess of CHF 80.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or any such security
interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provision”);
and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is
declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms
in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days
(the “guarantee provision”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 30% (or more) in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the
Company of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Company does not cure such default
within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document, no
Permitted Reorganization shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or any Security Document, or a Default or an Event of
Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any,
on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration
of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has


-----

occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event
of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured,
or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall
have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have
been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or
Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the_
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured, upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee
has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or
indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the
event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will
be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct
of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled
to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against all losses and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.


-----

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of
such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the
Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the
Trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation
to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding
the provision of an indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it, and it will be
for Holders to take action directly.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject
to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes).

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then
outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected, or if any amendment, waiver or other modification will
only amend, waive or modify one series of the Notes, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90%
(or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes, waived or
modified, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to bring suit for the payment of principal, premium,
if any, and interest on its Note on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided in such
Note;

(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release (i) all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral or (ii) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under
the Note Guarantees or the Indenture, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the
Security Document or the Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision of any Note
Document to this “Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company, the Issuer
or any Guarantor under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that
the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code,
or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the
Code) or change the minimum denomination for the Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect
or that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Holders or the Trustee;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the
issuance of Additional Notes;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the
Covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—
_Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees, to add security to or for_
the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or
retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents)
with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is
provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to
any Note Document; or

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (as
in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security
interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest
is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

For the purpose of calculating the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that have consented to or voted in favor
of any amendment, supplement or waiver, the CHF Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes
shall be as of the Issue Date.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or supplement of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment or supplement or waiver under the Indenture
by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender.


-----

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred in
any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Company or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Company will be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations,
including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of
the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary
Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to
the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants described under “—
_Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of each of the covenants described under “—_
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” “—Certain Covenants—Merger and_
_Consolidation—The_ _Company”_ and “—Certain _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation—Subsidiary_
_Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control ” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the payment default provision, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company, the Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment
default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of
_Default ” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of each of the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The_ _Company”_ and “—Certain _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation—Subsidiary_
_Guarantors”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Company, the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or_
(8) under “—Events of Default ” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or such entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in CHF or CHF-denominated
Swiss Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the
United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change
in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have
been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute,
or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of
1940; and


-----

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
with either defeasance option.

The Trustee will be entitled to exclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificates, documents, information and
opinions without independent verification.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within
one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose),
CHF or CHF-denominated Swiss Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as
the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note Documents or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Kroll Trustee Services Ltd. is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that,
except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During
the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take
or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the
Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or
any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices regarding the Notes will be given through SIX SIS. Once and for so long as the Notes are listed on the
Exchange – instead of the publication through SIX SIS – notices will be published on the internet site of the
Exchange (where notices are currently published under the address www.six-group.com/en/products-services/theswiss-stock-exchange/market-data/news-tools/official-notices.html) or (ii) otherwise in accordance with the
regulations of the Exchange.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the payment
of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of CHF-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under
or in connection with the Notes, and the relevant Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note,
the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a
result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will
be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making
any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective
of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out
herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Notes Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any CHFdenominated restriction herein, the CHF Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a nonCHF currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such nonCHF amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Company are held by Subsidiaries located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United
States. In addition, judgments obtained in the United States may not be enforceable in Switzerland and other
countries.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States.

Swiss Government Bond Rate, zero) plus 50 basis points; over

(2) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,

“Swiss Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct

or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Company in good faith)) most
nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to     , 2025; provided, however, that if the period from
the redemption date to     , 2025 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Swiss
Confederation for which a weekly average yield is given, the Swiss Government Bond Rate shall be obtained by
linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct
obligations of the Swiss Confederation for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes will be represented by a global note in bearer form without interest coupons attached (the “Global
Note”). On the Issue Date, the Global Note will be deposited by the Issuing Agent with SIX SIS as recognized
intermediary for such purposes by SIS Swiss Exchange for the entire duration of the Notes and until their complete
redemption.

Each holder of Notes (the “Holders” and, individually, a “Holder”) shall have a quotal co-ownership interest in
the Global Note to the extent of its claim against the Issuer (“Book-Entry Interests”), provided that for so long as
the Global Note remains deposited with SIX SIS, the co-ownership interest shall be suspended and so long as the
Notes are intermediated securities,the Notes may only be transferred by the entry of the transferred Notes in a
securities account of the transferee.

The records of SIX SIS will determine the number of Notes held through each participant in SIX SIS. In respect
of Notes held in the form of intermediated securities, the Holders will be the persons holding the Notes in a
securities account which is in their name, or in case of intermediaries, the intermediaries holding the Notes for
their own account in a securities account which is in their name.

The conversion of the Global Note into uncertificated securities or individually certificated securities is excluded.
Neither the Issuer nor the Holders shall at any time have the right to effect or demand the conversion of the Global
Note into, or the delivery of uncertificated securities or individually certificated securities.

Individually certificated securities may only be printed, in whole, but not in part, if the Issuing Agent determines,
in its sole discretion, that the printing of such individually certificated securities is necessary or useful. Should the
Issuing Agent so determine, it shall provide for the printing of the individually certificated securities without cost
to the Holders.

The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair
your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form,
Holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose. If
printed, the Notes shall be documented by individually certificated securities with no coupons attached in the
principal amount of CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof and shall be executed
by affixing thereon the facsimile signatures of two authorized officers of the Issuer. The individually certificated
securities will not be issued in bearer form, but exclusively in registered form for US tax purposes whereby, inter
alia, title exclusively by registration of the Holders in a register (the “Register”) to be established and maintained
by a registrar (the “Registrar”) appointed by the Issuer and acting on its behalf after consultation with the Issuing
Agent. In the case individually certificated securities are delivered, the entry of the Notes in the Issuer’s register
of uncertificated securities will be cancelled and Notes in the form of individually certificated securities shall be
delivered instead to the Holders, who for this purpose need to be registered in the Register, against cancellation
of the intermediated securities in their respective securities accounts. Notes documented by individually
certificated securities shall not be included in the records of SIX SIS or any other clearing system or any other
intermediary and, therefore shall not constitute intermediated securities.

The registration of a new Holder by the Registrar will only occur upon presentation of the relevant individually
certificated securities at the specified office of the Registrar. No transfer of such individually certificated securities
will be valid unless and until entered into the Register. Individually certificated securities may be registered only
in the name of and transferred to a named person.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Issuing Agent, the Agents or any
of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the applicable Paying Agent, who will then, in turn,
make such payments to SIX SIS, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its
customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern
payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.


-----

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Issuing Agent, the Agents and their respective agents
will treat the holders of the Global Notes (e.g., SIX SIS) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments
and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Issuing Agent, the
Agents or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

#### • any aspect of the records of SIX SIS or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of SIX SIS or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

#### • any other matter relating to the actions and practices of SIX SIS or any participant or indirect
participant or any participant or indirect participant; or

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests in the Notes through SIX SIS in CHF.

**Information Concerning SIX SIS**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of SIX SIS. We provide the following
summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and
procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time.
None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Issuing Agent, the Agents or any of their
respective agents is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to SIX SIS, SIX SIS holds securities for participating organizations.
They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic
book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. SIX SIS provides various services to its participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. SIX SIS participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to SIX SIS is also available to others such
as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a SIX
SIS participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because SIX SIS can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do
not participate in the SIX SIS system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such
persons may be limited.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through SIX SIS on days when those systems are open for business. In
addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
SIX SIS on the same business day as in the United States. United States investors who wish to transfer their
interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the
transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Zurich.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Exchange until the date of the first
interest payment. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in SIX SIS will be effected in
the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although SIX SIS currently follows the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among participants in SIX SIS, it is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such
procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Issuing Agent, the Agents or any of their respective agents will have any


-----

responsibility for the performance by SIX SIS or its participants or indirect participants of its respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.


-----

**TAXATION**

_Prospective purchasers of Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under_
_the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes including without limitation, the_
_consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or redemption of Notes or any interest therein._

**Swiss Tax Considerations**

The following statements contain an overview of the Swiss tax implications resulting from the Notes. The
following statements are based upon Swiss tax laws and administrative practices as currently in force.
Modifications of the applicable legal regulations may necessitate a re-evaluation of the tax consequences. The
summary below is not a substitute for legal or tax advice sought by interested parties. Prospective investors should
seek advice of their tax advisors to clarify any tax implications resulting from an investment in the Notes.

**_Swiss Income Tax_**

_Swiss Resident Private Noteholders: The Notes will be classified as ordinary Notes (gewöhnliche Obligationen)_
without predominant one-time interest payment (non-IUP) in accordance with Circular No 15 issued by the Swiss
Federal Tax Administration on 3 October 2017. Therefore, for private noteholders resident in Switzerland who
hold the Notes as private assets (Privatvermögen), the interest payments are treated as taxable interest and, thus,
subject to Swiss federal income and cantonal and municipal income taxes and required to be included in their
personal income tax return for the relevant tax period in which such interest payment is made. Capital gains
realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes are exempt from Swiss federal income and cantonal and municipal
income taxes.

_Business Noteholders: Swiss residents who hold the Notes as business assets and foreign residents who hold the_
Notes through a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business (Geschäftsvermögen) are in general taxed
according to Swiss statutory accounting principles (Massgeblichkeitsprinzip) for purposes of Swiss federal income
and cantonal and municipal income taxes. Interest payments as well as capital gains realized on the sale or
redemption of the Notes are in general part of their taxable business profit subject to Swiss federal income and
cantonal and municipal income taxes and required to be included in the income statement for the respective tax
period in which the relevant payment is made. Swiss-resident individuals who hold Notes and who, for income
tax purposes, are classified as “professional securities dealers” (gewerbsmässige Wertschriftenhändler) for
reasons of, among other things, frequent dealings and leveraged transactions in securities will be treated as though
they hold the Notes as part of Swiss business assets and be taxed as Business Noteholders.

_Non-Swiss Resident Noteholders: Noteholders who (i) are not resident in Switzerland and (ii) during the taxable_
year have not engaged in trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business within
Switzerland and (iii) are not subject to taxation in Switzerland for any other reason, will not be subject to any
Swiss federal, cantonal or municipal income or other taxes on income realized on interest payments received or
on capital gains resulting from a sale or redemption of the Notes.

**_Swiss Withholding Tax_**

Payments of interest in respect of the Notes by the Issuer will not be subject to Swiss withholding tax
(Verrechnungssteuer), and the Issuer will not be required to withhold tax at such rate from any payments of interest
under the Notes, if the Issuer is domiciled and effectively managed outside Switzerland at all time while any Notes
are outstanding and the proceeds of the Notes are neither directly nor indirectly used in Switzerland by any kind
of intragroup financing which would constitute a harmful “use of proceeds in Switzerland” as interpreted by the
Swiss Federal Tax Administration for purposes of Swiss Withholding Tax.

**_Swiss Federal Stamp Duty_**

The issue of the Notes to their initial holders will not be subject to Swiss federal stamp issuance duty
(“Emissionsabgabe”) or Swiss securities transfer tax (“Umsatzabgabe”) (primary market). A transfer of the Notes
in a secondary market transaction where a bank or another securities dealer in Switzerland or Liechtenstein (as
defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Tax Act) acts as an intermediary or is a party to the transaction may be subject
to Swiss securities transfer tax at an aggregate rate of up to 0.3% of the consideration paid for such Notes.

**_Automatic Exchange of Information_**

Switzerland has concluded a multilateral agreement with the EU on the international automatic exchange of
information (“AEOI”) in tax matters, which applies to all EU member states. In addition, Switzerland has
concluded the multilateral competent authority agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account
information (“MCAA”), and based on the MCAA, a number of bilateral AEOI agreements with other countries.


-----

Based on such agreements and the implementing laws of Switzerland, Switzerland collects and exchanges data in
respect of financial assets, including bonds, as the case may be, held in, and income derived thereon and credited
to, accounts or deposits with a paying agent in Switzerland for the benefit of individuals resident in a EU member
state or in another treaty state. An up-to-date list of the AEOI agreements to which Switzerland is a party that are
in effect, or signed but not yet in effect, can be found on the website of the State Secretariat for International
Financial Matters (SIF).

**_Swiss Facilitation of the Implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

The United States and Switzerland entered into an intergovernmental agreement to facilitate the implementation
of FATCA (an “IGA”). Under the IGA, financial institutions acting out of Switzerland generally are directed to
become participating foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”). The agreement ensures that accounts held by U.S.
persons with Swiss financial institutions are disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the
account holder or by means of group requests within the scope of administrative assistance on the basis of the
double taxation agreement between the United States and Switzerland. In this regard, on 17 July 2019, the US
Senate approved the 2009 protocol (the “Protocol”) amending the double taxation agreement regarding income
tax between Switzerland and the US (“DTA”). The amended DTA entered into force in 2019 and now provides
for a mechanism for the exchange of information upon request in tax matters between Switzerland and the United
States, which is in line with international standards, and allows the United States to make group requests under
FATCA concerning non-consenting U.S. accounts and non-consenting non-participating foreign financial
institutions for periods from 30 June 2014. Furthermore, the Swiss Federal Council approved a mandate for
negotiations with the U.S. on 8 October 2014, with regard to a change of the current direct-notification-based
regime to a regime where the relevant information is sent to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, which in turn
provides the information to the U.S. tax authorities. Government officials from Switzerland and the U.S. recently
discussed negotiations to take place during 2023 for a new IGA. It is not yet known how negotiations are
progressing and when any new regime would come into force.

**Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes. It is based
on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be,
legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisors as
to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. In addition, any reference to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or
withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a
reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités),
municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (impôt de solidarité) as well as
personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) generally. Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur
_la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the_
solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes.
Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain
circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Taxation of the Holders of the Notes_**

_Withholding Tax_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force there is no withholding tax on payments of interest
(including accrued but unpaid interest) or repayments of the principal of Notes.

_Income Taxation_

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

A non-resident holder of Notes, not having a permanent establishment or permanent representative in Luxembourg
to which such Notes are attributable, is not subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received,
redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes. A gain realized by such non-resident holder of Notes
on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes is further not subject to Luxembourg income tax.

A non-resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management
of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in


-----

Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or
received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

_Resident holders of Notes_

A resident corporate holder of Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or
issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its
taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. The same inclusion applies to an individual
holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking.

A resident holder of Notes that is governed by the law of 11 May 2007 on family estate management companies,
by the law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, by the law of 13 February 2007 on
specialized investment funds, or by the law of 23 July 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (provided it
is not foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and
that (ii) article 48 of the law of 23 July 2016 applies), is neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of
interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains realized on the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

A resident individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject
to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the
Notes. A gain realized by an individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/ her private
wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax,
provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion
of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income or assimilated thereto (e.g., issue discount,
redemption premium, etc.) is subject to Luxembourg income tax.

_Net Wealth Taxation_

A corporate holder of Notes, whether it is resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, if it maintains a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is
subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder of Notes is governed by the law of 11
May 2007 on family estate management companies, or by the law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for
collective investment, or by the law of 13 February 2007 on specialized investment funds, or is a securitization
company governed by the law of 22 March 2004 on securitization, or is a capital company governed by the law
of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as amended, or is a reserved alternative investment fund governed by
the law of 23 July 2016.

An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is resident of Luxembourg or not, is not subject to Luxembourg
wealth tax on such Notes.

**_Other Taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by
the Holders as a consequence of the issuance or the transfer of the Notes. However, a registration duty may be
due upon voluntary registration of the Notes in Luxembourg or in case the Notes are appended to a document that
requires mandatory registration in Luxembourg. Should other documents be registered along with the Notes, an
ad valorem rate could be applied, depending on the nature of the registered document.

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are
included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed or recorded in Luxembourg.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Guarantors, and Goldman Sachs International as initial purchaser, will enter into a purchase
agreement with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchaser, and the Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Notes.

The Initial Purchaser initially proposes to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of
this Offering Memorandum for the Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchaser may change the
Offering’s price and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchaser may offer and sell Notes through
certain of their affiliates or through registered broker-dealers.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

#### • the obligations of the Initial Purchaser to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are
subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by counsel;

#### • during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that
is 90 days after such dates, none of the Issuer, Guarantors, or any of their respective subsidiaries
will, without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchaser, offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the
Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year; and

#### • the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchaser against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchaser may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchaser may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges
in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on
the cover page hereof.

In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. An application will_
be made to the Authority through our listing agent and recognized representative of the Exchange, for the listing
of the Notes on the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for provisional
admission to trading and listing or that such listing will be maintained.

We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the Exchange or to
arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchaser has advised us that it intends to
make a market in the Notes, but it is not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchaser may discontinue any market
making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject
to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid
trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the
prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with the Offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchaser may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size,
which creates a short position for the Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes
in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchaser engages
in stabilizing or syndicate-covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the respective Notes on or about
the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be ten business days following the
date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + 10”) (the “Closing Date”).

by the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation
or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly,
and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any
applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation
would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering of the Notes, the distribution of this
Offering Memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or

5.2 Derivative instruments

For the periods ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the designated hedges were limited to cash flow hedges as the Group
did not have any hedges designated as fair value nor net investment hedges.


-----

The cash-flow hedges consisted of cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Group uses to protect against variability in future
interest cash flows on liabilities which bear interest at variable or fixed rates and/or foreign currency risk on EUR-denominated debt
instruments. The cash flows are expected to occur simultaneously with the payment of interests on debt instruments.

As of March 31, 2022, the Group had the following cross-currency interest rate swaps:

CHF (104'365) thousand and CHF (137'978) thousand. Except for the portion corresponding to the repurchased notes on March 27 and 29,
2023, the cross-currency interest rate swaps are fully effective, both retrospectively since inception and prospectively. Therefore the full
changes in their fair values (gains and losses) since inception have been recognised in other comprehensive income, and have been reclassified
to the income statement when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.

5.4 Finance instruments

The market value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position shown in the table below has
been ranked based on the three hierarchy levels defined by IFRS 13:

  - Level 1: quoted price in active markets;

  - Level 2: inputs observable directly or indirectly;

  - Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data.

Derivative instruments were the only items measured at fair value (level 2) in the statement of financial position and presented according to
their maturity date. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Estimated fair value for disclosure purpose:

- The carrying amounts of trade receivables, trade payables and fixed assets payables are a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of
their short-term maturities;

- The carrying amounts of deposits and other items and cash and cash equivalents correspond to the fair values;

- The fair value of fixed interest-bearing financial liabilities is estimated on the basis of the maturing future payments discounted at market
interest rates (level 2).

### financial statements


1.1


Description of business


Matterhorn Telecom S.A. and Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A. were incorporated as at March 25, 2015 as Luxembourg public limited liability Companies
(S.A.) governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Their registered office is established in Luxembourg-city.

Salt Mobile S.A. and its subsidiaries (hereafter provide consumers, businesses and other telecommunication operators with a wide
range of services including mobile telecommunications, data transmission, Internet / TV / Fixed Telephony and other value-added services.


1.2


Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements


These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the
European Union.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivative financial instruments,
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and the defined benefit pension plan that are measured at fair value.
The presentation of the current prepaid expenses as of 31.12.2021 in previous consolidated financial statements has been overstated by CHF 9.5 million
and the non-current prepaid expenses has been understated by the same amount. The classification of the prepaid expenses as of 31.12.2021 between
current and non-current in these financial statements has been re-presented accordingly, for comparability purposes. There is no impact on the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

These consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022 and the related consolidated statements of profit and loss, comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 were approved and authorised for issue on March 21, 2023
by the Board of Directors of Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A..

1.2.1 New standards and Amendments to IFRS affecting amounts reported in the financial statements

The Group has applied the following amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2022.

The amendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) prohibits an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of PP&E any proceeds
received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. It also clarifies that an entity is "testing whether the
asset is functioning properly" when it assesses technical and physical performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset is not relevant to
this assessment. Entities must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to items produced that are not an output of the
ordinary activities. This amendment had no impact of the Group as it does not produces any items.

Minor amendments were made to IFRS 3 Business Combinations to update the references to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and to
add an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent
Assets and Interpretation 21 Levies. The amendments also confirm that contingent assets should not be recognised at the acquisition date. These
amendment had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any
business combinations.

The amendment to IAS 37 clarifies that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation
of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts. Before recognising a separate provision for an onerous contract, the entity recognises any impairment
loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group
as of December 31, 2022.


-----

The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially
different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including
fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the behalf. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements

The amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements, based on the date of transition to IFRS, if no adjustments were made for
consolidation procedures and for the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary. This amendment is also applied to
an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements
of the Group as it is not a first-time adopter.


1.2.2 New and revised IFRS in issue but not yet effective


The Group has not early adopted any IFRS as endorsed by the European Union, which is not yet effective.
The Group does not expect any material impact from the application of any new standard or amendment that is not yet effective.


1.3


Use of estimates and judgements


In preparing the Group financial statements, the management makes estimates, judgements and assumptions, insofar as many elements
included in the financial statements cannot be measured with precision. These estimates and underlying assumptions are revised if the underlying
circumstances evolve or in light of new information or experience.

Consequently, estimates made as at December 31, 2022 may subsequently be changed. The underlying assumptions used for significant estimates are
as follows:

Nature of estimate and judgement


Note 4 : Revenue and Trade Receivables

Note 6 : Impairment

Note 8 : Provisions

Note 9 : Employee benefits (Pension)

Note 13 : Lease


Determination of the bad debt based on an assessment of the future recoverable amount using
the expected loss credit model

Key assumptions used to determine recoverable amounts: discount rate, perpetual growth rate,
expected cash flows

Provisions for dismantling: churn rate, inflation rate, discount rate and restoring cost

Discount rate, inflation rate, salary increases, mortality table

Right-of -use assets and lease liability valuation (assessment of whether a contract contains a
lease, lease term, probability to exercise a renewal option and discount rate)


The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group is a going concern and will continue its operations under the
scope defined above.

-----

This note describes the accounting policies applied to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial
statements.


2.1


Basis of consolidation


The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved when the Company:

  - has power over the investee;

  - is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

  - has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three
elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control on the
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit /
(loss) and other comprehensive income / (loss) from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the
subsidiary.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the accounting
policies.

All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.


2.2


Business combinations and goodwill


Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair
value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred to the former owners of
the acquiree by the Group, and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Transaction costs are recognised as a
profit or loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:

  - deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefits arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with
IAS 12 and IAS 19 respectively and;

in accordance with that standard.

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements until the date the Group lose the control on
the subsidiary. Gain and loss related to the divestment are recognized through the income statement for the difference between the fair value of the
proceeds and the carrying value of the net assets.

Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities taken over, regardless of the level of the investment held, is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for
impairment.

Therefore, the evolution of general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect to
the decline of local economic environments, the changes in the market capitalisation values of telecommunication companies, as well as actual economic
performance compared to market expectations represent external indicators that are analysed by the Group, together with internal performance
indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year.

IAS 36 requires that these tests be performed at the level of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or groups of CGUs which are likely to benefit from
acquisition-related synergies, within an operating segment. A CGU is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. This allocation is reviewed if the Group changes the level at which it
monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes. To determine whether an impairment loss should be recognised, the carrying value of the
assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use.


-----

The Company considers that the smallest group is the operational segment described in Note 3.
Impairment loss for goodwill is recorded in operating expenses and is never reversed subsequently.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition
date.
Contingent consideration, if any, is recognised against the acquisition cost at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity
or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or
loss.


2.3


Associates


Associates are companies where the Group has the power to exercise a significant influence but does not exercise control. Significant influence may be
obtained when the Group has 20% or more of the voting rights in the investee or has obtained a seat on the Board of Directors or otherwise participates
in the policy-making process of the investee.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method. The net assets and results are adjusted to comply with the accounting policies. The
carrying amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition of associates is included in the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures.


2.4


Segment reporting


The operating segment is the component of the Group that engages in business activities and which operating result is based on the internal reporting to


2.5


Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates


Functional and presentation currency

Transactions in foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate of the transaction date. Monetary assets and
liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate of the end of each reporting period and the resulting translation differences are recorded in the income
statement, in finance income or finance expenses.

Both for transactions qualifying as hedge accounting and for transactions qualifying as economic hedge, the change in fair value of derivatives that can be
attributed to changes in exchange rates is recorded in financial result. As the hedged item is not recognised in the statement of financial position in the
context of a cash flow hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded
in other comprehensive income and reclassified in:

  - profit or loss in accordance with the precedent method with respect to financial assets and liabilities;

  - the initial cost of the hedged item with respect to the non-financial assets and liabilities.


2.6


Revenue


Service sales

Revenue from mobile telecommunication access subscription fees, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, which is
generally 12 or 24 months. Revenue related to out of bundle operations is recognised when the service is rendered.

Fixed-network services comprise principally the basic charges for fixed telephony, broadband and TV connections as well as the domestic and
international telephony traffic of individuals. Revenues related to monthly flat rate subscription are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the
contract. Revenue related to out of bundle operations is recognised when the service is rendered.

Revenue from incoming and outgoing telephone calls, including those from the wholesale of traffic data, are recognised when the service is rendered.


-----

Equipment sales

Revenue from equipment sales is recognised at the moment time customer take delivery of the good.

Build-to-Suit (BTS) sites sales

According to the master service agreement signed with Swiss Infra Services S.A. on August 5, 2019, the Group builds network sites to be then sold to
Swiss Infra Services S.A. when available for use. The revenue from the sale is recognized when the site is transferred. Under IFRS 16, this transaction is
considered as a sale and lease-back transaction.

Content sales

The accounting for revenue sharing arrangements and supply of content depends on the analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding these
transactions. The revenue is recognized on a gross basis when the Group acts as a principal. The Group is considered as a principal if it controls the
specified services or goods before it is transferred to the customer. Otherwise the revenue is recognized on a net basis.

Promotional offers

Revenues are stated net of discounts. Certain commercial offers include a free service over a certain period (time-based incentives) when the customer
commits to a fixed period contract. In such circumstances the total revenue generated under the contract is spread over the fixed and non-cancellable
contract period.

Separable components of bundled offers

Some products sold by the Group, through its direct channel, include two components: equipment (e.g. a mobile handset / TV box) and service (fix or
mobile). As far as a sale with multiple products or services is concerned, the Group analyses all deliverables in the contract to identify the different
performance obligations. The fixed or determinable total amount in the contract is allocated to each identified performance obligation on the basis of
relative stand-alone selling prices. Non-refundable activation fees are not considered as a separate performance obligation. They are included in the
contract price and allocated on a relative stand-alone selling prices basis to the individual performance obligations under the customer contract.


2.7


Subscriber acquisition and retention costs, advertising and related cost


Subscriber acquisition and retention costs

Subscriber acquisition and retention costs, mainly commissions paid to retailers and employees, are capitalized in the statement of financial position and
amortized over the contract term if they are directly related to obtaining a contract. This results in the recognition of prepaid expenses under current
assets on the statement of financial position.

Advertising and related costs

Advertising, promotion, sponsoring, communication and brand marketing costs are expensed when incurred.


2.8


Other intangible assets


Intangible assets mainly consist of licenses, content rights, customer contracts, indefeasible rights of use, development costs and software.

Gross value

Intangible assets are initially and subsequently recognised at their acquisition or production cost. When intangible assets are acquired in a business
combination, their cost is determined in connection with the purchase price allocation based on their respective market value. When their market value is
not readily determinable, cost is determined using generally accepted valuation methods based on revenues, costs or other appropriate criteria.

Internally generated trademarks and subscriber bases are not recognised as assets.

Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRUs) acquired by the Group correspond to the right to use cable or capacity transmission cable granted for a fixed period and
packages of connection to our FTTH customers. IRUs are recognised as assets when the Group has the specific indefeasible right to use an identified
portion of the underlying asset, generally optical fibres or dedicated wavelength bandwidth, and the duration of the right corresponds to the major part of
the economic life of the underlying asset. The instalments to be paid for the Group IRUs are spread over a number of years. The related liability is
presented as long-lived asset payables with a current and a non-current portion. There is no IRUs contract that meet the criterion of recognition and
measurement of IFRS 16 Leases.


-----

The research and development projects mainly relate to the upgrade of the network architecture or functionality and the development of service
platforms aimed at offering new services to the customers. These projects generally give rise to the development of software. An intangible
asset arising from development is recognised if, and only if, the Group can demonstrate all of the following:

  - the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

  - its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

  - its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

  - how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

  - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and

  - its ability to measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during the development phase.

Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised on straight-line basis over their expected useful life:

Licenses 15 to 17 years

Software 3 to 5 years

Customer relations 1 to 11 years

Other intangible assets 5 to 20 years

Licenses to operate mobile telephone networks are amortised over the license period from the date when the licence is ready to be used. The right to
operate a mobile network is recorded in an amount corresponding to the fixed portion of the royalties due when the license was granted. The variable
user fee is expensed as incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

|Licenses|15 to 17 years|
|---|---|
|Software|3 to 5 years|
|Customer relations|1 to 11 years|
|Other intangible assets|5 to 20 years|


2.9


Property, plant and equipment


Gross Value

Fixed assets are recognised at their purchase or production cost, which includes costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and to a
working condition for its intended use. It also includes the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling, removing the item and restoring the site on which it
is located, representing the obligation incurred by the Group.

The cost of networks includes design and construction costs, as well as costs related to the improvement in equipment and facility capacity.

The total cost of an asset is allocated to its different components. Each component is accounted for separately when the components have different
useful lives or when the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity varies. Depreciation rate and method
of such components are different accordingly.

Maintenance and repair costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred, except where they serve to increase the productivity or useful life of the asset.

Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of a property, plant and equipment less any residual value and reflects the pattern in which the future economic
benefits of the asset are expected to be consumed. Thus, the asset is usually depreciated on the straight-line basis over the following estimated useful
lives:

Buildings 10 to 30 years

Network: Switching, transmission and other network equipment 5 to 10 years

Network: Cables and civil works 15 to 30 years

IT equipment: Computer hardware 3 to 5 years

These useful lives are reviewed annually and are adjusted if they differ from previous estimates. These changes in accounting estimates are recognised
prospectively.

|Buildings|10 to 30 years|
|---|---|
|Network: Switching, transmission and other network equipment|5 to 10 years|
|Network: Cables and civil works|15 to 30 years|
|IT equipment: Computer hardware|3 to 5 years|


-----

2.10


Impairment of non current assets


At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful
life to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.

Indicators of impairment include events or circumstances occurring during the period (such as obsolescence, physical damage, significant changes to the
manner in which the asset is used, worse than expected economic performance, a drop in revenues or other external indicators).

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the impairment loss (if any).

The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, which is assessed using the discounted cash
flows method based on best estimate of the set of economic conditions. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of cash-generating units to which the asset belongs to.

The impairment loss recognised is equal to the difference between the net book value and the recoverable amount.


2.11


Financial assets and liabilities


Financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. They are subsequently measured either at fair value or at amortised cost using the
effective interest method depending on the category in which they are classified.

The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or
when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. This calculation includes all fees and points paid or
received between parties to the contract.

2.11.1 Financial assets to be measured at amortised cost

This category mainly includes trade receivables, cash, certain deposits, as well as other loans and receivables. These instruments are recognised at fair
value upon origination and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Receivables with no stated interest rate are
measured at initial nominal amount unless there is any significant impact resulting from the application of an implicit interest rate.

The loss allowances for loan and receivables are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in
making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the past history, existing market conditions as well
as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade
receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past
due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of minimum 6 months before the closing date and the
corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking
information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from the company. Indicators that there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery include, amongst others, a failure to make contractual payments for an extended period of time.

Impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within in other operating expenses.

Financial assets are fully or partially derecognised when:

  - the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;

  - an obligation to pay the cash flows received from the asset to a third party has been assumed;

  - the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have been transferred to a third party and all the risks and rewards of the asset have been
substantially transferred.

2.11.2 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are:

  - assets held for trading that the Group acquired principally for the purpose of selling them in the short term, or where the Group does not have the
ability to exert either control or significant influence;

  - part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of recent actual pattern of short-term
profit-taking;

  - derivative assets not qualifying for hedge accounting.


-----

2.11.3 Financial liabilities to be measured at amortised cost

Borrowings and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are recognised upon inception at fair value of the sums paid or received in exchange of the
liability, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Current interest-free payables are booked at their nominal
value.

Transaction costs that are directly related to the acquisition or issuance of a financial liability are deducted from its carrying value. The costs are
subsequently amortised over the life of the liability by using the effective interest method.
Within the Group, some financial liabilities at amortised cost are subject to hedge accounting. They mostly relate to foreign currency borrowings in order
to hedge future cash flows against changes in currency value (cash flow hedge).

2.11.4 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss consist mainly of derivative instruments described below.

2.11.5 Recognition and measurement of hedging derivatives

Derivatives are financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and are classified in a separate line item of the statement of
financial position when they qualify for hedge accounting.

Hedge accounting designation:
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including
whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items.
The Group enters into cross-currency / interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, payment dates and
notional amount. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical
terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. As all critical terms matched during the
year, there is an economic relationship.
Hedge ineffectiveness for cross-currency / interest rate swaps may occur due to the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps.

The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting:
The cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (such as a future purchase or sale) and could affect profit or loss. The hedged
item being not recognised, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income. Such
amounts are recycled to profit or loss when the hedged financial asset or hedged financial liability affects the income statement. When the hedged item
is not a financial asset or a financial liability, such amounts are reclassified in its initial cost.
Hedge accounting is terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognised, when the Group voluntarily revokes the designation of the hedging
relationship, or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are that amounts booked in other comprehensive
income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognised or, in all other cases, when the hedged item affects
profit or loss. Subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss.


2.12


Inventory


Inventory mainly comprises handsets, TV boxes and related accessories for resale and is measured at the lower of their cost and their net realisable
value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs
necessary to make the sale.
Inventory also includes the work in progress related to the sites built to be sold within the Built to Suit Program under the Master Services Agreement
signed with Swiss Infra Services SA on August 5, 2019. When the sites are sold, the related construction cost is presented in cost of equipment sold.

Obsolete, defective or slow-moving inventories have been written down to estimated net realisable value. The recoverable amount of inventory is
calculated based on inventory age and turnover.


-----

2.13


Income and deferred taxes


The current and deferred income tax expense is reviewed each year and includes both current and deferred taxes.

Current tax is measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its
interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation.

Deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for unused tax
losses, using the liability method taking into account the tax rates, which are enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting period. Deferred
tax assets are recognised only when their realisation is considered probable.

Deferred tax assets arising from tax losses are not recognised under certain circumstances specific to each tax entity, and particularly when:

  - entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carryforwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to forecasts horizon and
uncertainties as to the economic environment;

  - entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations;

  - tax losses are uncertain to be used due to the risks of divergent interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation.

The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.


2.14


Provisions


A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation towards a third party as resulting from a past event and it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The obligation may be legal, regulatory or contractual or it may represent a constructive obligation deriving from the actions where, by an
established pattern of past practice or published policies creating a valid expectation on the part of other parties that the Group will discharge certain
responsibilities.

The estimate of the amount of the provision corresponds to the probable outflow of resources likely to be incurred by the Group to settle its obligation.

Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements. They correspond to:

  - probable obligations resulting from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more

  - present obligations arising from past events that are not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions. The costs that might
result from these proceedings are only accrued when they are probable and when their amount can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range.
The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may
require a reassessment of this risk.

Restructuring

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised only when the restructuring has been announced and the Group has drawn up or has started to
implement a detailed formal plan, prior to the end of the reporting period.

Asset Retirement Obligation

The Group is required to dismantle equipment and restore sites and office buildings. Provision is measured as the best estimate of the amount required
to settle its obligations (on a per site basis for mobile antennas). These dismantling costs are calculated on the basis of the identified costs for the current
financial year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of future trends in prices, inflation, etc., and are discounted at a risk rate based on
market yields on high quality corporate bonds (same discount rate as the one used for the employee benefits).

This estimate is revised at the end of each reporting period and adjusted, when appropriate. The asset to which the provision relates is also adjusted for
the corresponding amount.

The majority of this obligation is not expected to result in cash outflow within a year, the full provision is reported under non-current provision.


-----

2.15


Employee benefits


The Group is affiliated to a legally independent pension fund. The annual contributions to this fund are made by both employee and employer in
accordance with unchanged regulatory provisions. This is a defined contribution plan according to Swiss legislation, but it qualifies as a defined benefit
plan under IAS 19 due to the constructive obligation of the employer to guarantee a minimum rate of interest and a fixed conversion rate.

The plan is providing several categories of coverage and the employees' contributions are based on various percentages of their gross salaries. All
employees are entitled to participate in the plan for retirement, disability or death. The Group's contributions exceed those of the employees. The risks of
disability and death are entirely reinsured by an insurance company.

The Group's obligation in respect of its defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of the future benefit that employees have earned in
return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine the present value of the obligation, and the fair value of
any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary in accordance with the projected unit credit method using information
available at year end. Current pension entitlements are charged to income in the period in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in full
under other comprehensive income in the reporting period in which they arise.

Cash & cash equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and at banks, deposits and other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less.


2.17


Lease


The Group leases various network sites, offices, stores and vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods, but may have extension
options as described below.
The Group assess whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of the contract. The contract contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The criteria to be considered to meet the definition of a lease are the follows:

  - The contract specifies the right to use an asset,

  - The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset over the period of use, and

  - The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease
components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate
lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any
covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing
purposes.

The leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

The Group does not apply any exemption for short term leases or low value leases.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the fixed lease payments.
Extension options are included in a number of leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.
Lease liabilities are remeasured in the following cases:

  - Change in the lease payment due to a change in the discount rate

  - Change in the lease term or in the extension option assessment

  - Change in the lease contract when the modifications are not accounted for a separate lease

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option.
Extension options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended. Extension options in offices, stores and vehicles
leases have not been included in the lease liability, because the Group could replace the assets without significant cost or business disruption.

Extension options for the network sites have been considered when they are reasonably certain to be extended.


-----

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for
leases in the Group, the incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds
necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for
leases held by the Group and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country and currency.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

  - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

 - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,

  - any initial direct costs, and

  - restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain

Sale and leaseback transaction

If an entity (the seller-lessee) transfers an asset to another entity (the buyer-lessor) and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor, both the sellerlessee and the buyer-lessor assess whether the transfer of the asset is a sale. An entity applies the requirements for determining when a performance
obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset. If the transfer of an asset by the
seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset the seller-lessee measures the right-of-use asset arising
from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right-of-use retained by the seller-lessee.
Accordingly, the seller-lessee recognises only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.

The Group is reporting one operating segment. The operating segment is reported based on the internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker
(CODM), and has been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies. The CODM is using EBITDA (excluding the gain on disposal and
other gains, holding companies impacts and IFRS adjustments) as the main measure of performance and for resource allocation purposes.

No measures of assets or liabilities are being reported regularly to the CODM.

The Group activity is mainly operated in Switzerland.

Services revenue is recognized over time whereas equipment revenue is recognized at a point in time.

The Group applies the practical expedient from IFRS 15.121 to the non-disclosure of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied subscription based
performance obligations since the right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customers. With respect to bundle offers
with a sale of a subsidised device together with a subscription service, estimated revenues of CHF 155.9 million is expected to be recognised from such
contracts in the coming years (CHF 40.1 million in 2024 and 2025).

In 2022, the equipment revenue and other revenue includes the proceeds from the sale of sites under Build-to-Suit program with Swiss Infra Services
S.A. for CHF 4.4 million (CHF 6.0 million in 2021).

Contract assets mainly include deferrals related to the sale of bundled offers. When subsidised devices are sold with a service contract, the allocation of
the revenue for the delivered device based on standalone selling price results in an earlier revenue recognition. This results in the recognition of a
contract asset.

The Group outsources part of its receivables collection. Customer receivables are mainly transferred to an agency if overdue by 121 days or more.
Enterprise and other partners customers are treated on a case by case basis. Receivables under servicing agreement are recognised in 2022 for a total
value of CHF 33.3 million (CHF 25.6 million in 2021), most of them being covered by a bad debt provision amounting CHF 32.8 million (CHF 25.0 million in
2021).


-----

The Group sold certain trade receivables to a collection agency for cash. These financial assets, that are classified as financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss, are derecognised in their entirety at the date of the transfer. As of December 31, 2022 the receivables classified as fair value through profit
or loss, had a carrying amount, equivalent to their fair value, of approximately CHF 0.8 million (CHF 1.7 million in 2021).

Goodwill as of December 31, 2022 amounts to CHF 1'313.8 million (CHF million in 2021). As per IAS 36, goodwill is tested for impairment
annually.

1. Key assumptions and impairment testing

A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated shall be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying amount of the unit,
including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit:

  - if the recoverable amount of the unit exceeds its carrying amount, the unit (including the goodwill allocated to it) is not impaired

  - if the carrying amount of the unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized.

As described in the Note 2.4, the Group is operating on one segment which represents the unique CGU for impairment testing purpose.

At the end of each reporting period, an entity is required to assess whether the goodwill may be impaired (i.e. its carrying amount may be higher than its
recoverable amount).



- Perpetual growth:

- Discount rate (WACC) pre-tax:


+1% (-0.5% in 2021)
7.6% (5.3% in 2021)


More specifically, perpetual growth rate considers both economic environment and market conditions. Economic environment assessment relies on
economic growth projections built by public and private financial institutions.
The DCF model uses a projection of the most reliable information available as of the testing date and for the next 3 years in order to measure free cash

Based on the evaluation performed, no impairment charge has been recorded as of December 31, 2022 (no impairment as of December 31, 2021).


-----

2. Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis has been performed on recoverable values, based on significant variations the discount rate after tax (+2%) or expected cash-flows
after tax (-20%). As at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outcome of the impairment test was not materially sensitive to any of the changes described
above.

Corporate income Tax profit / (loss)


Salt Mobile S.A. is liable for taxes in all Swiss cantons based on an inter-cantonal allocation at various rates. With this regard the current average tax rate
is our estimated rate of 15.73% (15.86% in 2021) based on the statutory tax rates applicable in Switzerland, which can potentially vary in the upcoming
years.

The Group is liable for capital and income taxes. Matterhorn Telecom S.A. and Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A., which are registered in Luxembourg,
are subject to an income tax at a rate of 24.94% (24.94% in 2021).

In Luxembourg, tax losses incurred before 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely. Since 2017, tax losses can be carried forward for a maximum of
seventeen years. In Switzerland, tax losses can be carried forward for a maximum of seven years.

The income tax is broken down as follows:

|---|---|
|Post employment benefit - Other non current employee benefit 3'324|- 5'029|
|Wages, salaries and post-employment benefits 3'324|5'029|


The other non current employee benefit relates to retention bonuses to be paid after a given service period.

The Group provides retirement benefits to its employees as required by Swiss law through a Pension Fund that is a separate legal entity. The
employees are insured for the risks of old age, death and disability.
The plan's benefits are based on age, salary and on an individual old age account. The plan is financed by contributions paid by the employees and by the
employer. The assets of the Pension Fund are invested in qualified insurance policies Equities, Bonds, Real Estate, Alternative Investments and Cash, in
accordance with organizational guidelines and investment regulations.

The Board of Trustees consists of an equal number of employer and employee representatives and is responsible for managing the Foundation in
accordance with Swiss law. Per the regulatory framework, a temporary funding shortfall is permitted. The Board of Trustees must take appropriate
measures to solve the shortfall within a reasonable timeframe. If those measures do not lead to the desired results, the Pension Fund may temporarily
charge remedial contributions to employers, insured persons and pensioners. The employer contribution must at least equal the aggregate contributions
levied from the insured persons.
The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to operating defined benefit plan are:

that there is a mismatch between cash inflow and cash outflow. The structure of the portfolios is reviewed and asset-liability matching analyses are
performed on a regular basis to minimize both risks.

mortality risk: the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. However, if life
expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the plan and consequently increases in the plan's
liabilities. Mortality assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to mitigate this risk.

All Swiss plans qualify as defined benefit plans under IAS 19. Under Swiss accounting principles, the Pension Plan Salt Mobile SA is overfunded by 106%
as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: 125%).

The standard retirement age is 65. Employees are entitled to early retirement with a reduced old-age pension. The amount of the old-age pension is the
result of multiplying the individual retirement savings account at the time of retirement by a conversion rate set out in the pension-fund rules. The
retirement benefits can also be paid out in the form of a capital payment either in full or in part. In case of early retirement, the employer also finances an
OASI bridging pension until the standard retirement age. One of the benefits provided by the Group is a temporary disability pension up to retirement.
This disability pension is independent of the years of service. Disability and death risks are reinsured by an external insurance company.

Actuarial valuations of the plan assets and of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by an external actuarial expert. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The expected service cost for the year ending December 31, 2023 is CHF 4.4 million.

The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follow:

Derivative instruments


For the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the designated hedges were limited to cash flow hedges as the Group did
not have any hedges designated as fair value or net investment hedges.

The cash-flow hedges consisted of cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Group uses to protect against variability in future interest cash
flows on liabilities which bear interest at variable or fixed rates and/or foreign currency risk on EUR-denominated debt instruments. The cash flows are
expected to occur simultaneously with the payment of interests on debt instruments.

The swaps are measured at fair value (level 2). Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

During the third quarter 2022, the Group extended the maturity of the cross-currency interest rate Swaps on Senior Secured Notes (c) from 2024 to
2026 with a decrease of the hedging rate. Cash flows related to the extension of the maturity of the cross-currency interest rate Swaps will occur
simultaneously with the payment of interests on Senior Secured Notes (c). As a result, the hedge instruments remains effective and the extension did
not have any impact on the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

On April 29, 2022, the group unwound EUR 6 million cross-currency interest rate Swap following the repurchase and extinguishment of EUR 6 million of
Senior Secured Notes due 2027.

During the year 2022, the cash flow hedges were effective, both retrospectively since inception and prospectively as of December 31, 2022. Therefore
the full changes in their fair values (gains and losses) since inception initially were been recognised in other comprehensive income, and were reclassified
to the income statement when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.

The net amount recognised in OCI (net change in OCI) related to hedging activities is described in the table below.

Management of covenants


Under the Revolving Credit Facility which forms part of the Senior Facilities Agreement dated September 12, 2019 the Group is obliged to

The financial covenant shall not be required to be satisfied unless, on the last day of the relevant period, the aggregate outstanding exposure in respect
of the RCF (subject to certain exceptions) is greater than CHF 35.0 million.
As at December 31, 2022, the Company complied with those covenants as the RCF was not used.

Under the indentures to the Senior Secured Notes issued by the Company and its subsidiaries, certain non-financial covenants are to be respected. The
non-compliance may result in an Event of Default and in the principal and the accrued unpaid interest becoming due and payable immediately. As at
December 31, 2022, the Company complied with those covenants.

Other non cash movements mainly include finance costs and change in fair value of derivative instruments.

11.1 Financial risks

The Group is subject to various financial risks. These risks include capital risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and financial market risk (including interest rate risk
and currency risk). These risks are monitored by Management of the Group.

Capital risk management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the
optimisation of the debt and equity balance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which mainly includes borrowings described in Note 10, cash and cash equivalents and equity
attributable to equity holders, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

Credit Risk management

Financial instruments that could potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, trade receivables, investments and
deposits.

The Group considers that it has an extremely limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable due to its large
and diverse customer base (residential, professional and large business customers). In addition, the maximum value of the credit risk on these financial
assets is equal to their recognised net book value.


-----

Liquidity risk management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management
framework for the management of the short-medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowings facilities, by continuously monitoring cash flows, and by
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities, including from time to time the repayment or repurchase of our existing indebtedness
prior to its scheduled maturity. Note 10 sets out details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk
(refer to the Note 11.2).

Interest Rate Risk

The Group manages its net exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate financial debt and variable rate financial debt in its total
financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, the Group may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges periodic payments based on
a notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates and into forward contracts, in which it exchanges fixed amounts of foreign currency
and fixed amounts of Swiss francs.


The sensitivity of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is analysed only for components of net financial debt. Only these
components are interest-bearing and therefore exposed to interest rate risk. The Group is primarily exposed to a change in EURIBOR3m. To mitigate this
risk, the Group entered into cross-currency interest-rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and
Euribor3m rate interest amounts (refer to note 10.1).


Counterparty Risk management

The Group is exposed to a counterparty risk on the fair value of the derivatives. This risk is assessed using a Credit Valuation Adjustment and is
calculated using probabilities of default of the banking counterparties. This risk of counterparty is considered as hedge ineffectiveness and is therefore
recognized trough the consolidated income statement of the year. This CVA was nil. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Foreign exchange rate risk management

The Group operates mainly in the currency of its country (CHF). However, the Group is subject to foreign currency risk arising from borrowings and future
commercial transactions which can be done in Euros (purchase of handsets or roaming for example). The Group uses derivative financial instruments to
hedge certain exposures (for instance Bonds denominated in Euros).

The Group uses foreign currency inflows to pay for its foreign currency outflows. If necessary, the Group buys foreign currency shortly before the
transaction.

Sensitivity of cash flow hedge reserves

A 0.5% change in spot rates would change the market value of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges and the associated cash flow
hedge reserves by approximately CHF 43.8 million as at December 31, 2022 (change of CHF 22.5 million as at December 31, 2021).

foreign exchange rates.

11.2 Financial instruments

The market value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position shown in the table below has been ranked
based on the three hierarchy levels defined by IFRS 13:
- Level 1: quoted price in active markets;
- Level 2: inputs observable directly or indirectly;
- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data.

Derivative instruments were the only items measured at fair value (level 2) in the statement of financial position and presented according to their maturity
date. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date.


-----

Estimated fair value for disclosure purpose:

  - The carrying amounts of trade receivables and payables are a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of their short-term maturities;

  - The carrying amounts of deposits and other items, fixed assets payables and cash and cash equivalents correspond to the fair values;

  - The fair value of fixed interest-bearing financial liabilities is estimated on the basis of the maturing future payments discounted at market interest
rates (level 2).

**Audit report**

To the Shareholder of
**Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A.**

#### Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

**Our opinion**

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries
(the “Group”) as at 31 December 2021, and of its consolidated financial performance and its
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

_What we have audited_

The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year then ended;
the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income / (loss) for the year then ended;
the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021;
the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting
policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (Law of
23 July 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of
23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the
“Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements” section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements. We have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information stated in the annual report including the Consolidated Management Report but does not
include the consolidated financial statements and our audit report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We
have nothing to report in this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial**
**statements**

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an audit report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as
adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg
by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the
audit. We also:

identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control;

20


-----

obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;

conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease
to continue as a going concern;

evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

21


-----

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions
taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

#### Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

The Consolidated Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Audit report**

To the Shareholder of
**Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A.**

#### Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

**Our opinion**

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries
(the “Group”) as at 31 December 2020, and of its consolidated financial performance and its
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

_What we have audited_

The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income / (loss) for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;

- the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and

- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting
policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (Law of
23 July 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of
23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the
“Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements” section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements. We have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information stated in the Consolidated Management Report but does not include the consolidated
financial statements and our audit report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We
have nothing to report in this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial**
**statements**

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an audit report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as
adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg
by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the
audit. We also:

- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control;

16


-----

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;

- conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease
to continue as a going concern;

- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

17


-----

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions
taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

#### Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

The Consolidated Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

### financial statements


1.1


Description of business


Matterhorn Telecom S.A. and Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A. were incorporated as at March 25, 2015 as Luxemburg public limited liability
Companies (S.A.) governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Their registered office is established in Luxembourg-city.

Salt Mobile S.A. and its subsidiaries (hereafter provide consumers, businesses and other telecommunication operators with a
wide range of services including mobile telecommunications, data transmission, Internet / TV / Fixed Telephony and other value-added services.


1.2


Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements


These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by
the European Union.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivative financial
instruments, the defined benefit pension plan, and investment in Teldas AG that are measured at fair value.

These consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020 and the related consolidated statements of profit and loss, comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 were approved and authorised for issue on
March 23, 2021 by the Board of Directors of Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A..

1.2.1 New standards and Amendments to IFRS affecting amounts reported in the financial statements

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2020:

The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other
information, in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence
decisions made by the primary users. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of, nor is there expected to be any
future impact to the Group.

The amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include,
at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that, together, significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it clarifies that a
business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group, but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations.

The reliefs relate to hedge accounting and have the effect that the reforms should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any
hedge ineffectiveness should continue to be recorded in the income statement.

On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions - amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees
from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As
a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee
that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it would
account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification.
The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. Earlier application is permitted.
This practical expedient has been early applied by the Group, refer to Note 13.


-----

1.2.2 New and revised IFRS in issue but not yet effective


The Group has not early adopted any IFRS as endorsed by the European Union, which is not yet effective.
The Group does not expect any material impact from the application of any new standard or amendment that is not yet effective.


1.3


Use of estimates and judgements


In preparing the Group financial statements, the management makes estimates, judgements and assumptions, insofar as many elements
included in the financial statements cannot be measured with precision. These estimates and underlying assumptions are revised if the underlying
circumstances evolve or in light of new information or experience.
Consequently, estimates made as at December 31, 2020 may subsequently be changed. The underlying assumptions used for significant estimates
are as follows:

Nature of estimate and judgement


Note 4 : Revenue and Trade Receivables

Note 6 : Impairment

Note 8 : Provisions

Note 9 : Employee benefits (Pension)

Note 13 : Lease

Note 14 : Result in associates


Determination of the bad debt based on an assessment of the future recoverable amount using
the expected loss credit model

Key assumptions used to determine recoverable amounts: discount rate, perpetual growth
rate, expected cash flows

Provisions for dismantling: churn rate, inflation rate, discount rate and restoring cost

Discount rate, inflation rate, salary increases, mortality table

Right-of -use assets and lease liability valuation (assessment of whether a contract contains a
lease, lease term, probability to exercise a renewal option and discount rate)

Assessment of the significant influence based on the voting rights, number of Board Members
and part in significant transactions


The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group is a going concern and will continue its operations
under the scope defined above.

1.5 COVID-19

In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to significant impacts on Switzerland as well as worldwide economic situation. During 2020, among the
various measures against the spread of the COVID-19, the Government restricted the economic activities in Switzerland. Therefore, during the
lockdown period, the majority of our shops were closed, retail activities reduced to a minimum and international travels were restricted. Despite
relaxations in May 2020, the remaining restrictions and overall international travel activity slow down have continued to affect all roaming activities.


-----

These developments have negatively impacted the financial performance of the Group, and more particularly the second, third and fourth quarters of
the year. The effects are mostly related, but not limited to:
- Travel restrictions and bans leading to the reduction in wholesale Visitor roaming and Customer roaming traffics.

 - The slowdown of retail activity in particular in our physical channels and during the lockdown period, translating notably into reduced acquisitions
and retentions acts as well as decreasing or no sales or other services in stores.
- The reduction of specific revenue and profit lines such as the above-mentioned sales and other in-store services.
- Technical unemployment, mainly for sales employees during the lockdown period.
The overall COVID-19 financial impacts cannot be quantified at this stage due to global uncertainties and the combination of various factors, including
the overall pandemic evolution, the government measures or the customer behaviour. Additionally, the broader impact of any major economic
slowdown or downturn remains difficult to estimate at this stage.

Since the beginning of the pandemic the Group Management has constantly observed and analysed the Covid-19 impact on the Group and the key
estimates and assumptions have been reassessed as of December 31, 2020. They essentially remain unchanged as compared to the ones reported
in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019.


This note describes the accounting policies applied to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial
statements.


2.1


Basis of consolidation


The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its
subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

  - has power over the investee;

  - is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

  - has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the
three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control on the
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of
profit / (loss) and other comprehensive income / (loss) from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control
the subsidiary.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the
accounting policies.

All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.


2.2


Business combinations and goodwill


Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at
fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree by the Group, and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Transaction costs are
recognised as a profit or loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:

  - deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefits arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance
with IAS 12 and IAS 19 respectively and;

measured in accordance with that standard.

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements until the date the Group lose the control
on the subsidiary. Gain and loss related to the divestment are recognized through the income statement for the difference between the fair value of
the proceeds and the carrying value of the net assets.


-----

Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities taken over, regardless of the level of the investment held, is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for
impairment.

Therefore, the evolution of general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect
to the decline of local economic environments, the changes in the market capitalisation values of telecommunication companies, as well as actual
economic performance compared to market expectations represent external indicators that are analysed by the Group, together with internal
performance indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year.

IAS 36 requires that these tests be performed at the level of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or groups of CGUs which are likely to benefit from
acquisition-related synergies, within an operating segment. A CGU is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows
that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. This allocation is reviewed if the Group changes the level at
which it monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes. To determine whether an impairment loss should be recognised, the carrying
value of the assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher
of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

The Company considers that the smallest group is the operational segment described in Note 3.
Impairment loss for goodwill is recorded in operating expenses and is never reversed subsequently.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the
acquisition date.
Contingent consideration, if any, is recognised against the acquisition cost at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is classified either as
equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised
in profit or loss.


2.3


Associates


Associates are companies where the Group has the power to exercise a significant influence but does not exercise control. Significant influence may
be obtained when the Group has 20% or more of the voting rights in the investee or has obtained a seat on the Board of Directors or otherwise
participates in the policy-making process of the investee.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method. The net assets and results are adjusted to comply with the accounting policies. The
carrying amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition of associates is included in the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint
ventures.


2.4


Segment reporting


The operating segments are components of the Group that engage in business activities and whose operating results are based on the internal
reporting to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker in order to determine the allocation of resources and to assess of the operating
performance.


2.5


Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates


Functional and presentation currency

Transactions in foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate of the transaction date. Monetary assets
and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate of the end of each reporting period and the resulting translation differences are recorded in the
income statement, in finance income or finance expenses.

Both for transactions qualifying as hedge accounting and for transactions qualifying as economic hedge, the change in fair value of derivatives that
can be attributed to changes in exchange rates is recorded in financial result. As the hedged item is not recognised in the statement of financial
position in the context of a cash flow hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of change in fair value of the hedging
instrument is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified in:

  - profit or loss in accordance with the precedent method with respect to financial assets and liabilities;

  - the initial cost of the hedged item with respect to the non-financial assets and liabilities.


-----

2.6


Revenue


.


Service sales

Revenue from mobile telecommunication access subscription fees, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the minimum contract term, which is
generally 12 or 24 months. Revenue related to out of bundle operations is recognised when the service is rendered.

Fixed-network services comprise principally the basic charges for fixed telephony, broadband and TV connections as well as the domestic and
international telephony traffic of individuals. Revenues related to monthly flat rate subscription are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of
the contract. Revenue related to out of bundle operations is recognised when the service is rendered.

Revenue from incoming and outgoing telephone calls, including those from the wholesale of traffic data, are recognised when the service is
rendered.

Equipment sales

Revenue from equipment sales is recognised at the moment time customer take delivery of the good.

Build-to-Suit (BTS) sites sales

Part of the master service agreement signed with Swiss Infra Services S.A. on August 5, 2019, the Group builds network sites to be then sold to
Swiss Infra Services S.A. when available for use. The revenue from the sale is recognized when the site is transferred. Under IFRS 16, this
transaction is considered as a sale and lease-back transaction.

Content sales

The accounting for revenue sharing arrangements and supply of content depends on the analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding these
transactions. The revenue is recognized on a gross basis when the Group acts as a principal. The Group is considered as a principal if it controls the
specified services or goods before it is transferred to the customer. Otherwise the revenue is recognized on a net basis.

Promotional offers

Revenues are stated net of discounts. Certain commercial offers include a free service over a certain period (time-based incentives) when the
customer commits to a fixed period contract. In such circumstances the total revenue generated under the contract is spread over the fixed and noncancellable contract period.

Separable components of bundled offers

Some products sold by the Group, through its direct channel, include two components: equipment (e.g. a mobile handset / TV box) and service (fix or
mobile). As far as a sale with multiple products or services is concerned, the Group analyses all deliverables in the contract to identify the different
performance obligations. The fixed or determinable total amount in the contract is allocated to each identified performance obligation on the basis of
relative stand-alone selling prices. Non-refundable activation fees are not considered as a separate performance obligation. They are included in the
contract price and allocated on a relative stand-alone selling prices basis to the individual performance obligations under the customer contract.


2.7


Subscriber acquisition and retention costs, advertising and related cost


Subscriber acquisition and retention costs

Subscriber acquisition and retention costs, mainly commissions paid to retailers and employees, are capitalized in the statement of financial position
and amortized over the contract term if they are directly related to obtaining a contract. This results in the recognition of prepaid expenses under
current assets on the statement of financial position.

Advertising and related costs

Advertising, promotion, sponsoring, communication and brand marketing costs are expensed when incurred.


2.8


Other intangible assets


Intangible assets mainly consist of licenses, content rights, customer contracts, reseller and MVNO agreements, indefeasible rights of use,
development costs and software.


-----

Gross value

Intangible assets are initially and subsequently recognised at their acquisition or production cost. When intangible assets are acquired in a business
combination, their cost is determined in connection with the purchase price allocation based on their respective market value. When their market
value is not readily determinable, cost is determined using generally accepted valuation methods based on revenues, costs or other appropriate
criteria.

Internally generated trademarks and subscriber bases are not recognised as assets.

Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRUs) acquired by the Group correspond to the right to use cable or capacity transmission cable granted for a fixed
period. IRUs are recognised as assets when the Group has the specific indefeasible right to use an identified portion of the underlying asset,
generally optical fibres or dedicated wavelength bandwidth, and the duration of the right corresponds to the major part of the economic life of the
underlying asset. The instalments to be paid for the Group IRUs are spread over a number of years. The related liability is presented as long-lived
asset payables with a current and a non-current portion.

The research and development projects mainly relate to the upgrade of the network architecture or functionality and the development of
service platforms aimed at offering new services to the customers. These projects generally give rise to the development of software. An
intangible asset arising from development is recognised if, and only if, the Group can demonstrate all of the following:

Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised on straight-line basis over their expected useful life:

Licenses Over contractual period

Software 3 to 5 years

Customer relations 1 to 11 years

Reseller and MVNO contracts 9 to 11 years

Other intangible assets 5 to 20 years

Licenses to operate mobile telephone networks are amortised over the license period from the date when the licence is ready to be used. The right
to operate a mobile network is recorded in an amount corresponding to the fixed portion of the royalties due when the license was granted. The
variable user fee is expensed as incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

|Licenses|Over contractual period|
|---|---|
|Software|3 to 5 years|
|Customer relations|1 to 11 years|
|Reseller and MVNO contracts|9 to 11 years|
|Other intangible assets|5 to 20 years|


2.9


Property, plant and equipment


Gross Value

Fixed assets are recognised at their purchase or production cost, which includes costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and to
a working condition for its intended use. It also includes the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling, removing the item and restoring the site on
which it is located, representing the obligation incurred by the Group.

The cost of networks includes design and construction costs, as well as costs related to the improvement in equipment and facility capacity.

The total cost of an asset is allocated to its different components. Each component is accounted for separately when the components have different
useful lives or when the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity varies. Depreciation rate and
method of such components are different accordingly.

Maintenance and repair costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred, except where they serve to increase the productivity or useful life of the
asset.


-----

Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of a property, plant and equipment less any residual value and reflects the pattern in which the future economic
benefits of the asset are expected to be consumed. Thus, the asset is usually depreciated on the straight-line basis over the following estimated
useful lives:

Buildings 10 to 30 years

Network: Switching, transmission and other network equipment 5 to 10 years

Network: Cables and civil works 15 to 30 years

IT equipment: Computer hardware 3 to 5 years

These useful lives are reviewed annually and are adjusted if they differ from previous estimates. These changes in accounting estimates are
recognised prospectively.

|Buildings|10 to 30 years|
|---|---|
|Network: Switching, transmission and other network equipment|5 to 10 years|
|Network: Cables and civil works|15 to 30 years|
|IT equipment: Computer hardware|3 to 5 years|


2.10


Impairment of non current assets


At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite
useful life to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.

Indicators of impairment include events or circumstances occurring during the period (such as obsolescence, physical damage, significant changes to
the manner in which the asset is used, worse than expected economic performance, a drop in revenues or other external indicators).

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the impairment loss (if any).

The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, which is assessed using the discounted
cash flows method based on best estimate of the set of economic conditions. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of cash-generating units to which the asset belongs to.

The impairment loss recognised is equal to the difference between the net book value and the recoverable amount.

2.11 Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. They are subsequently measured either at fair value or at amortised cost using the
effective interest method depending on the category in which they are classified.

The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument
or when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. This calculation includes all fees and points
paid or received between parties to the contract.

2.11.1 Financial assets to be measured at amortised cost

This category mainly includes trade receivables, cash, certain deposits, as well as other loans and receivables. These instruments are recognised at
fair value upon origination and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Receivables with no stated interest
rate are measured at initial nominal amount unless there is any significant impact resulting from the application of an implicit interest rate.

The loss allowances for loan and receivables are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in
making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the past history, existing market conditions as
well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade
receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days
past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 6 months before the closing date and the
corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking
information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from the company. Indicators that there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery include, amongst others, a failure to make contractual payments for an extended period of time.


-----

Impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within in other operating expenses.

Financial assets are fully or partially derecognised when:

  - the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;

  - an obligation to pay the cash flows received from the asset to a third party has been assumed;

  - the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have been transferred to a third party and all the risks and rewards of the asset have been
substantially transferred.

2.11.2 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are:

  - assets held for trading that the Group acquired principally for the purpose of selling them in the short term;

  - part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of recent actual pattern of shortterm profit-taking;

  - derivative assets not qualifying for hedge accounting.

2.11.3 Financial liabilities to be measured at amortised cost

Borrowings and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are recognised upon inception at fair value of the sums paid or received in exchange of the
liability, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Current interest-free payables are booked at their nominal
value.

Transaction costs that are directly related to the acquisition or issuance of a financial liability are deducted from its carrying value. The costs are
subsequently amortised over the life of the liability by using the effective interest method.
Within the Group, some financial liabilities at amortised cost are subject to hedge accounting. They mostly relate to foreign currency borrowings in
order to hedge future cash flows against changes in currency value (cash flow hedge).

2.11.4 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss consist mainly of derivative instruments described below.

2.11.5 Recognition and measurement of hedging derivatives

Derivatives are measured at fair value and are presented in the statement of financial position according to their maturity date whether or not they
qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9.

Derivatives are financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss and are classified in a separate line item of the statement of
financial position when they qualify for hedge accounting.

Hedge accounting designation:
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including
whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items.
The Group enters into cross-currency / interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate,, payment
dates and notional amount. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with
the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. As all critical terms matched
during the year, there is an economic relationship.
Hedge ineffectiveness for cross-currency / interest rate swaps may occur due to the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps.

The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting:
The cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (such as a future purchase or sale) and could affect profit or
loss. The hedged item being not recognised, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in other
comprehensive income. Such amounts are recycled to profit or loss when the hedged financial asset or hedged financial liability affects the income
statement. When the hedged item is not a financial asset or a financial liability, such amounts are reclassified in its initial cost.
Hedge accounting is terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognised, when the Group voluntarily revokes the designation of the hedging
relationship, or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are that amounts booked in other
comprehensive income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognised or, in all other cases, when the
hedged item affects profit or loss. Subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss.

Inventory


Inventory mainly comprises handsets, TV boxes and related accessories for resale and is measured at the lower of their cost and their net realisable
value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs
necessary to make the sale.
From 2020 onwards, inventory also includes the work in progress related to the sites built to be sold within the Built to Suit Program under the
Master Services Agreement signed with Swiss Infra Services SA on August 5, 2019. When the sites are sold, the related construction cost is
presented in cost of equipment sold.

Obsolete, defective or slow-moving inventories have been written down to estimated net realisable value. The recoverable amount of inventory is
calculated based on inventory age and turnover.


2.13


Income and deferred taxes


The current and deferred income tax expense is reviewed each year and includes both current and deferred taxes.

Current tax is measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its
interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation.

Deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for
unused tax losses, using the liability method taking into account the tax rates, which are enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting
period. Deferred tax assets are recognised only when their realisation is considered probable.

Deferred tax assets arising from tax losses are not recognised under certain circumstances specific to each tax entity, and particularly when:

  - entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carryforwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to forecasts horizon and
uncertainties as to the economic environment;

  - entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations;

  - tax losses are uncertain to be used due to the risks of divergent interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation.

The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.


2.14


Provisions


A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation towards a third party as resulting from a past event and it is probable that an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The obligation may be legal, regulatory or contractual or it may represent a constructive obligation deriving from the actions where, by an
established pattern of past practice or published policies creating a valid expectation on the part of other parties that the Group will discharge certain
responsibilities.

The estimate of the amount of the provision corresponds to the probable outflow of resources likely to be incurred by the Group to settle its
obligation.

Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements. They correspond to:

  - probable obligations resulting from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or

  - present obligations arising from past events that are not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions. The costs that
might result from these proceedings are only accrued when they are probable and when their amount can be quantified or estimated within a
reasonable range. The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of
legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk.


-----

Restructuring

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised only when the restructuring has been announced and the Group has drawn up or has started to
implement a detailed formal plan, prior to the end of the reporting period.

Asset Retirement Obligation

The Group is required to dismantle equipment and restore sites and office buildings. Provision is measured as the best estimate of the amount
required to settle its obligations (on a per site basis for mobile antennas). These dismantling costs are calculated on the basis of the identified costs
for the current financial year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of future trends in prices, inflation, etc., and are discounted at a
risk-free rate (same discount rate as the one used for the employee benefits), based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds.

This estimate is revised at the end of each reporting period and adjusted, when appropriate. The asset to which the provision relates is also adjusted
for the corresponding amount.

The majority of this obligation is not expected to result in cash outflow within a year.


2.15


Employee benefits


The Group is affiliated to a legally independent pension fund. The annual contributions to this fund are made by both employee and employer in
accordance with unchanged regulatory provisions. This is a defined contribution plan according to Swiss legislation, but it qualifies as a defined
benefit plan under IAS 19 due to the constructive obligation of the employer to guarantee a minimum rate of interest and a fixed conversion rate.

The plan is providing several categories of coverage and the employees' contributions are based on various percentages of their gross salaries. All
employees are entitled to participate in the plan for retirement, disability or death. The Group's contributions exceed those of the employees. The
risks of disability and death are entirely reinsured by an insurance company.

The Group's obligation in respect of its defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of the future benefit that employees have earned
in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine the present value of the obligation, and the fair value
of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary in accordance with the projected unit credit method using
information available at year end. Current pension entitlements are charged to income in the period in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are
recorded in full under other comprehensive income in the reporting period in which they arise.


2.16


Cash & cash equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and at banks, deposits and other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less. Restricted cash is considered as cash equivalent if it can be available with a short notice period (less than 3 months). These items
are stated at historical cost.


2.17


Lease


The Group leases various network sites, offices, stores and vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods, but may have extension
options as described below.
The Group assess whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of the contract. The contract contains a lease if it conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The criteria to be considered to meet the definition of a lease are the
follows:

  - The contract specifies the right to use an asset,

  - The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset over the period of use, and

  - The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease
components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to
separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose
any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for
borrowing purposes.

The leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

The Group does not apply any exemption for short term leases or low value leases.


-----

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the fixed lease payments.
Extension options are included in a number of leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.
Lease liabilities are remeasured in the following cases:

  - Change in the lease payment due to a change in the discount rate

  - Change in the lease term or in the extension option assessment

  - Change in the lease contract when the modifications are not accounted for a separate lease

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option.
Extension options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended. Extension options in offices, stores and
vehicles leases have not been included in the lease liability, because the Group could replace the assets without significant cost or business
disruption.

Extension options for the network sites have been considered when they are reasonably certain to be extended.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case
for leases in the Group, the incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the
funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and
conditions.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for
leases held by the Group and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country and currency.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

  - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

 - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,

  - any initial direct costs, and

  - restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably

Sale and leaseback transaction

If an entity (the seller-lessee) transfers an asset to another entity (the buyer-lessor) and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor, both the sellerlessee and the buyer-lessor assess whether the transfer of the asset is a sale. An entity applies the requirements for determining when a
performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset. If the transfer of
an asset by the seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset the seller-lessee measures the right-ofuse asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right-of-use retained by the
seller-lessee. Accordingly, the seller-lessee recognises only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.

Operating segments are reported based on the internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), and have been prepared in
accordance with the accounting policies. The CODM is using EBITDA (excluding the gain on disposal and other gains) as the main measure
of performance and for resource allocation purposes. EBITDA for 2019 has been represented to reflect the exclusion of the gain on disposal of a
subsidiary for CHF 359.7 million.

No measures of assets or liabilities are being reported regularly to the CODM.

The Group activity is mainly operated in Switzerland.

Services revenue is recognized over time whereas equipment revenue is recognized at a point in time.

The Group applies the practical expedient from IFRS 15.121 to the non-disclosure of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied subscription based
performance obligations since the right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customers. With respect to bundle offers
with a sale of a subsidised device together with a subscription service, estimated revenues of CHF 220.6 million is expected to be recognised from
such contracts in the coming years (CHF 55.7 million in 2022 and 2023).

In 2020, the equipment revenue and other revenue includes the proceeds from the sale of sites under Build-to-Suit program with Swiss Infra
Services S.A. for CHF 13.4 million.

Contract assets mainly include deferrals related to the sale of bundled offers. When subsidised devices are sold with a service contract, the
allocation of the revenue for the delivered device based on standalone selling price results in an earlier revenue recognition. This results in the
recognition of a contract asset.

The Group outsources part of its receivables collection. Customer receivables are mainly transferred to an agency if overdue by 121 days or more.
Enterprise and MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) customers are treated on a case by case basis. Receivables under servicing agreement are
recognised in 2020 for a total value of CHF 16.6 million (CHF 14.0 million in 2019), most of them being covered by a bad debt provision amounting
CHF 16.2 million (CHF 13.5 million in 2019).

The Group sold certain trade receivables to a collection agency for cash. These financial assets, that are classified as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss, are derecognised in their entirety at the date of the transfer. As of December 31, 2020 the receivables classified as fair value
through profit or loss, had a carrying amount, equivalent to their fair value, of approximately CHF 0.7 million (CHF 0.9 million in 2019).

Information about the credit quality of trade receivable and the exposure to credit risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk can be
found in Note 11.1.

6.1


Goodwill


Goodwill as of December 31, 2020 amounts to CHF million (CHF million in 2019). As per IAS 36, goodwill is tested for impairment
annually.

1. Key assumptions and impairment testing

A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated shall be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying amount of the
unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit:

  - if the recoverable amount of the unit exceeds its carrying amount, the unit (including the goodwill allocated to it) is not impaired

  - if the carrying amount of the unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss must be recognized

As described in the Note 2.4, the Group is operating on one segment which represents the unique CGU for impairment testing purpose.

At the end of each reporting period, an entity is required to assess whether the goodwill may be impaired (i.e. its carrying amount may be higher
than its recoverable amount).



- Perpetual growth:

- Discount rate (WACC) pre-tax:


1% (-0.5% in 2019)
5.3% (5.3% in 2019)


More specifically, perpetual growth rate considers both economic environment and market conditions. Economic environment assessment relies on
economic growth projections built by public and private financial institutions.
The DCF model uses a projection of the most reliable information available as of the testing date and for the next 3 years in order to measure free

Based on the evaluation performed, no impairment charge has been recorded as of December 31, 2020 (no impairment as of December 31, 2019).

2. Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis has been performed on recoverable values, based on significant variations the discount rate after tax (+2%) and expected cashflows after tax (-20%). As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outcome of the impairment test was not sensitive to any of the changes described
above.

Corporate income Tax profit / (loss)


Salt Mobile S.A. is liable for taxes in all Swiss cantons based on an inter-cantonal allocation at various rates. With this regard the current average tax
rate is our estimated rate of 16.09% (16.85% in 2019) based on the statutory tax rates applicable in Switzerland, which can potentially vary in the
upcoming years.

The Group is liable for capital and income taxes. Matterhorn Telecom S.A. and Matterhorn Telecom Holding S.A., which are registered in Luxemburg,
are subject to an income tax at a rate of 24.94% (24.94% in 2019).

In Luxemburg, companies may carry over losses arisen before 2017 until they are used up for an unlimited number of years to offset taxable profits.
From 2017, losses arisen can be used for a period of seventeen years. In Switzerland, tax losses are normally available to be set off against future
taxable income for a period of seven years.

The income tax is broken down as follows:

|2020 (in thousands of Swiss Francs)|2019|
|---|---|
|Total tax expense (25'381) Current tax expense in respect of the current year (16'298) Deferred tax income / (expense) (9'083)|63'958 (29'027) 92'985|

Income tax expense recognised in profit or loss (25'381) 63'958

In 2019, the effect on deferred tax balances due to the change in income tax rate is mainly due to the enacted decrease of the income tax rates in
several cantons from January 1, 2020.
The income exempted from tax in 2019 corresponds to the gain on the disposal of a subsidiary (refer to Note 15).

The other non current employee benefit relates to retention bonuses to be paid over several years.

The Group provides retirement benefits to its employees as required by Swiss law through a Pension Fund that is a separate legal entity. The

The plan's benefits are based on age, salary and on an individual old age account. The plan is financed by contributions paid by the employees and by
the employer. The assets of the Pension Fund are invested in qualified insurance policies Equities, Bonds, Real Estate, Alternative Investments and
Cash, in accordance with organizational guidelines and investment regulations.

The Board of Trustees consists of an equal number of employer and employee representatives and is responsible for managing the Foundation in
accordance with Swiss law. Per the regulatory framework, a temporary funding shortfall is permitted. The Board of Trustees must take appropriate
measures to solve the shortfall within a reasonable timeframe. If those measures do not lead to the desired results, the Pension Fund may
temporarily charge remedial contributions to employers, insured persons and pensioners. The employer contribution must at least equal the
aggregate contributions levied from the insured persons.
All Swiss plans qualify as defined benefit plans under IAS 19. The Pension Plan Salt Mobile SA is overfunded by 125.3% as of December 31, 2020
(December 31, 2019: 125%).

The standard retirement age is 65. Employees are entitled to early retirement with a reduced old-age pension. The amount of the old-age pension is
the result of multiplying the individual retirement savings account at the time of retirement by a conversion rate set out in the pension-fund rules. The
retirement benefits can also be paid out in the form of a capital payment either in full or in part. In case of early retirement, the employer also
finances an OASI bridging pension until the standard retirement age. One of the benefits provided by the Group is a temporary disability pension up
to retirement. This disability pension is independent of the years of service. Disability and death risks are reinsured by Zurich Assurance.

Actuarial valuations of the plan assets and of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by an external actuarial expert. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The expected employer contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending December 31, 2021 are CHF 5.0 million.

The cash-flow hedges during the period consisted of cross-currency swaps, that the Group uses to protect against variability in future
interest cash flows on liabilities which bear interest at variable or fixed rates and/or foreign currency risk on EUR-denominated debt instruments. The
cash flows are expected to occur simultaneously with the payment of interests on debt instruments.

Cross-currency swaps


1'866'795 72'132


The swaps are measured at fair value (level 2). Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

On March 26, 2019, the Group partially unwound a swap in parallel of the repurchase of EUR 40.0 million of senior notes.
On September 19, 2019, the Group unwound swaps simultaneously to the repurchase of the Senior Notes and Senior secured notes of EUR 1'333.9

As a consequence, the cash flow hedge reserve at the date of the transaction has been recycled through the income statement for CHF 1.2 million
(gain).

In March 2020, coincident with the partial repayment of the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of additional EUR 3.125% Senior Secured Notes due
to 2026, the related hedge instrument was adjusted with no cash settlement. As a consequence, the cash flow hedge reserve at the date of the
settlement has been recycled through income statement for CHF 1.7 million (loss).

During the year 2020, the cash flow hedges were fully effective, both retrospectively since inception and prospectively as of December 31, 2020.
Therefore the full changes in their fair values (gains and losses) since inception initially were been recognised in other comprehensive income, and
were reclassified to the income statement when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.

During the year 2020, the net amount recognised in OCI (net change in OCI) related to hedging activities was a net increase of CHF 10.1 million (net
decrease of CHF 13.3 million in 2019) deferred in OCI. The details of these changes are described in the table below.

In 2020 and 2019, hedge ineffectiveness is mainly due change in credit risk adjustment and unwound swaps.

In 2019, the other financial expenses mainly relate to the premium paid on bonds repurchase within the refinancing transaction.


10.4


Management of covenants


Under the new Revolving Credit Facility which forms part of the Senior Facilities Agreement dated September 12, 2019 the Group is obliged

The financial covenant shall not be required to be satisfied unless, on the last day of the relevant period, the aggregate outstanding exposure in
respect of the RCF (subject to certain exceptions) is greater than CHF 35.0 million.
As at December 31, 2020, the Company complied with those covenants as the RCF was not used.

Under the indentures to the Senior Secured Notes issued by the Company and its subsidiaries, certain non-financial covenants are to be respected.
The non-compliance may result in an Event of Default and in the principal and the accrued unpaid interest becoming due and payable immediately.
As at December 31, 2020, the Company complied with those covenants.

### liabilities

11.1 Financial risks

The Group is subject to various financial risks. These risks include capital risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and financial market risk (including interest rate
risk and currency risk). These risks are monitored by Management of the Group.

Capital risk management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the
optimisation of the debt and equity balance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which mainly includes borrowings described in Note 10, cash and cash equivalents and equity
attributable to equity holders, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

Credit Risk management

Financial instruments that could potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, trade receivables, investments
and deposits.

The Group considers that it has an extremely limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable due to its
large and diverse customer base (residential, professional and large business customers). In addition, the maximum value of the credit risk on these
financial assets is equal to their recognised net book value.

Liquidity risk management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk
management framework for the management of the short-medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The
Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowings facilities, by continuously monitoring cash
flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities, including from time to time the repayment or repurchase of our existing
indebtedness prior to its scheduled maturity. Note 10 sets out details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further
reduce liquidity risk (refer to the Note 11.2).


-----

Interest Rate Risk

The Group manages its net exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate financial debt and variable rate financial debt in its total
financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, the Group may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges periodic payments
based on a notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates and into forward contracts, in which it exchanges fixed amounts of
foreign currency and fixed amounts of Swiss francs.

The sensitivity of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is analysed only for components of net financial debt. Only these
components are interest-bearing and therefore exposed to interest rate risk.

Counterparty Risk management

The Group is exposed to a counterparty risk on the fair value of the derivatives. This risk is assessed using a Credit Valuation Adjustment
amounting to CHF 1.2 million as at December 31, 2020 (CHF 1.4 million as at December 31, 2019) and calculated using probabilities of default of the
banking counterparties. This risk of counterparty is considered as hedge ineffectiveness and is therefore recognized trough the profit / (loss) of the
year.

Sensitivity of financial expenses
Based on a constant amount of debt and a constant management policy, a 1% rise in interest rates would result in an increase of CHF 2.2 million in
financial expense as at December 31, 2020 (CHF 1.9 million as at December 31, 2019).

Foreign exchange rate risk management

The Group operates mainly in the currency of its country (CHF). However, the Group is subject to foreign currency risk arising from borrowings and
future commercial transactions which can be done in Euros (purchase of handsets or roaming for example). The Group uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge certain exposures (for instance Bonds denominated in Euros).

The Group uses foreign currency inflows to pay for its foreign currency outflows. If necessary, the Group buys foreign currency shortly before the
transaction.

Sensitivity of cash flow hedge reserves

A 0.5% change in spot rates would change the market value of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges and the associated cash flow
hedge reserves by approximately CHF 37 million as at December 31, 2020 (change of CHF 46 million as at December 31, 2019).

11.2 Financial instruments

The market value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position shown in the table below has been
ranked based on the three hierarchy levels defined by IFRS 13:
- Level 1: quoted price in active markets;
- Level 2: inputs observable directly or indirectly;
- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data.

Derivative instruments were the only items measured at fair value (level 2) in the statement of financial position and presented according to their
maturity date. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

1In 2020, the Group has benefited from rent reductions due to the pandemic. These reduction were not assessed as a lease modification as
permitted by the practical expedient indicated on the Note 1.2.1. It has resulted in a positive impact of CHF 0.6 million.

In 2020, the income from sub-lease right-of-use assets in 2020 mainly related to sub-leased space in stores recognized as other operating income.
The decrease is related to the disposal of a subsidiary in 2019 as described in note 15.

Through the shareholder agreement signed August 5, 2019, the Group is guaranteed one seat on the board of Swiss Infra Services S.A. and
participates in significant financial and operating decisions. The Group has therefore determined that it has significant influence over this entity, even
though it only holds 10% of the voting rights.
