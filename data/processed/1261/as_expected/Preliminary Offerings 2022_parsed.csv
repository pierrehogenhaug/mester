1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1097,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1097.1,,1097.1.1,,"Nielsen prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and its fiscal year is the calendar year. On March 5, 2021, Nielsen completed the sale of its Global Connect business (such business, “Global Connect,” and the sale of Global Connect, the “Connect Transaction”) to affiliates of Advent International Corporation (“Advent”), pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2020 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, Nielsen began to separately report the results of Global Connect on a discontinued operations basis in accordance with ASC 205 in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and to present the related assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. These changes have been applied with respect to Nielsen’s historical financial data as of September 30, 2022, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. See Note 12 to Nielsen’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and Note 20 to Nielsen’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, each included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, for more information. Other than as set forth above, historical financial data for other periods included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum have not been restated to reflect this classification.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,2674,USE OF UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,2674.1,,2674.1.1,,"This offering memorandum contains unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for the Issuer, in order to give effect to the Transactions and assuming that the Notes offered hereby were issued by the Issuer rather than the Bridge Facility in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, which has been derived from the historical financial statements of Nielsen included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the notes accompanying the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and should be read together with the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X but does not constitute Article 11 pro forma information because it has not been prepared pursuant to a requirement to present pro forma information in a public filing with the SEC. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to the Transactions (assuming that the Notes offered hereby were issued by the Issuer rather than the Bridge Facility in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition) as if they had occurred on (i) September 30, 2022, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet, and (ii) January 1, 2021 for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. The historical financial statements of Nielsen have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum to give effect to pro forma events that are transaction accounting adjustments, which is necessary to account for the Transactions and the issuance of the Notes offerred hereby in accordance with GAAP. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Nielsen’s management believes are reasonable. We have not made any ----- adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information to reflect any expected cost savings arising from the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and liabilities, which are recognized in accordance with Nielsen’s revenue recognition policy as if Nielsen had originally executed the customer contract; any excess value of the consideration transferred over the net assets will be recognized as goodwill. Nielsen has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date based on management’s preliminary valuation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed using information currently available. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and these differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and Nielsen’s future results of operations and financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared by our management team for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had the Transactions and issuance of the Notes occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that Nielsen will experience. The pro forma adjustments are based on the preliminary assumptions and information available that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual results of Nielsen may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data have no impact on Nielsen’s previously reported consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations, cash flows or equity. See “Summary— Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.” In this offering memorandum, references to financial or other data presented as “pro forma” or “on a pro forma basis” refer to a presentation that applies adjustments to give pro forma effect to the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"This offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by reference herein include certain supplemental financial measures of our performance that have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, including, for example, Adjusted EBITDA (and margin thereof), Constant currency revenue, Organic constant currency revenue, Net income from continuing operations attributable to Nielsen shareholders, Free cash flow, Adjusted free cash flow (and margin and conversion thereof), Pro forma first lien debt, Pro forma total net debt, Pro forma first lien net debt, Pro forma total net leverage ratio and Pro forma first lien net leverage ratio. Such non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared with a view towards compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, and are not measures of net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our definitions of such non-GAAP financial measure terms vary from each other and from others in our industry. For additional information regarding our use of such non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to investors, and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.” The financial information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, in particular with respect to (a) the omission of certain consolidating financial information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries, (b) the presentation of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information in the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated ----- Financial Information” and (c) the exclusion of historical financial information of the Issuer, which has no historical operations. We have included Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum for illustrative purposes, to present estimated run-rate cost savings, inclusive of savings from commercial expense, operations expense, technology, general and administrative and third-party spend that are planned, but have not been actioned to date. Further, Pro forma adjusted EBITDA was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, but, in the view of the management of Nielsen, has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and what Nielsen believes its financial performance would have been had these actions been fully implemented at the start of the applicable period. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this offering memorandum are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Pro forma adjusted EBITDA. None of Nielsen, the Issuer or Nielsen’s independent auditors, or any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the estimated cost savings included in the Pro forma adjusted EBITDA information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The assumptions and estimates underlying the Pro forma adjusted EBITDA figures are inherently uncertain and, though considered reasonable by the management of Nielsen and the Issuer as of the date of preparation, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual cost savings to differ materially from the estimated cost savings included in Pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including, among others, risks and uncertainties including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering memorandum. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Pro forma adjusted EBITDA is indicative of the future performance of the Issuer or that actual results will not differ materially from the estimates included in Pro forma adjusted EBITDA.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Differentiators,9.2.1,,"- **_Inclusion and representation. We believe our data is representative of the entire media ecosystem. Ad buyers and sellers do not have access to market wide viewership data, requiring a third-party aggregator to provide common metrics. We seek to ensure that all of our products are representative of diverse populations and offer greater demographic representation, higher quality and more actionable insights for better decision making. - **_Breadth of Offerings. Our measurement, data and analytics solutions are deeply embedded into our clients’ workflows and offer a 360-degree view of the audience that we believe cannot be found by a single provider anywhere else. With products that span the full marketing cycle, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help marketers drive growth with the confidence that they are spending their dollars efficiently and effectively. - **_Enhanced Data Assets and Measurement Science. Our extensive portfolio of decades of consumer behavioral and transactional data enables us to provide critical information to our clients and allows for long-term historical comparability. Our big data sets are validated by behaviors of over 100,000 people on our panels, allowing us to provide persons-level measurement that is representative of all audiences. - **_Global Scale and Brand. We believe we are the currency of choice in the U.S. media market and uniquely positioned to deliver the most reliable deduplication metrics across linear and digital platforms. Our footprint, independence, credibility and leading market positions continue to contribute to our long-term growth and strong operating margins in the evolving global media landscape. We believe the industry wants a single holistic view of the market as media fragmentation continues and the landscape gets more complex, and we think Nielsen, through Nielsen ONE, is uniquely positioned to offer this. - **_Strong, Diversified Client Relationships. Many of the world’s largest and emerging media companies, marketers and advertising agencies rely on our information and analytics to create value for their business. We have historically generated stable revenue streams that are characterized by multi-year contracts and high renewal rates. Approximately 80% of the revenue base for the upcoming year is committed under contract at the beginning of each year, while the average length of relationship with our top five clients is more than 30 years. - **_Scalable Operating Model. Our global presence and operating model allow us to scale our services and solutions rapidly and efficiently. Our flexible architecture allows us to incorporate leading third-party technologies as well as data from external sources and enables our clients to use our technology and solutions on their own technology platforms.

This has resulted in a large market for business information and insight, which we believe will continue to grow with our clients. Our clients are predominantly media publishers and advertisers and their agencies, although we see demand increasing from content creators, owners, distributors and other ecosystem participants as well. - **_The landscape is dynamic and changing. Consumers are rapidly changing their media consumption patterns and the proliferation of new formats and channels has led to increased time spent with media, and the six largest U.S. media companies in aggregate grew faster in 2021 than in the prior years as they added digital solutions. In addition, simultaneous usage of more than one screen is becoming a regular aspect of daily consumer media consumption. We believe our distinct ability to provide independent cross-media audience measurement and metrics helps clients better understand, adapt to and profit from the continued transformation of the global media landscape. - **_Consumers are more connected, informed and in control. Nearly 60% of the global population—over 4 billion people—use the internet, and over 3 billion are digital video viewers. Advances in technology have given consumers a greater level of control of when, where and how they consume information and interact with media and brands. These shifts in behavior create significant complexities for our clients. Our broad portfolio of measurement and analytical services enables our clients to engage consumers with more impact and efficiency and to actively participate in and shape conversations with their audiences. - **_Increasing amounts of consumer information are leading to new marketing approaches. The advent of the internet and digital platforms has created rapid growth in consumer data, and as a result, companies are looking for real-time access to more granular levels of data to understand growth opportunities quickly and precisely. This presents a significant opportunity for us to work with companies to effectively manage, integrate and analyze large amounts of information and extract meaningful insights that allow marketers to generate profitable growth. According to research from MoffettNathanson, U.S. TV ad spend (Linear plus Advertising Video on Demand (“AVOD”)) is expected to grow to approximately $86 billion in 2022, up from $81 billion in 2021. Our ----- audience estimates are the primary metrics used to determine the value of programming and advertising in the U.S. television advertising marketplace. Furthermore, approximately 95% of U.S. TV ad spend in 2021 relied on Nielsen data. Including the United States, our technology is used to measure television viewing in 37 countries. We also measure markets that account for approximately 70% of global TV ad spend, according to eMarketer research, and offer measurement and analytic services in more than 55 countries, including the United States. In addition, according to research from MoffettNathanson, U.S. digital ad spend (Video and Other) will grow to approximately $192 billion in 2022, up from $167 billion in 2021. Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings are used by 21 of the top 25 global advertisers by total ad spend to help determine the effectiveness of their digital spend, and we continue to expand coverage, with the ability to measure approximately 90% of total video digital spend across computer, mobile and connected television (“CTV”) based on Nielsen estimates and eMarketer research. Our audience estimates are the primary metrics used to determine the value of programming and advertising in the U.S. audio advertising marketplace. Sources: MoffettNathanson, eMarketer.

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Services and Solutions,9.4.1,,"Nielsen serves the world’s media and content ecosystem and is the gold standard in audience measurement, data and analytics. We provide viewership and listening measurement data and analytics primarily to media publishers and marketers and their advertising agencies for linear television, streaming, digital (which includes computer, mobile and CTV) and listening platforms. Our business consists of two major product categories: One Measurement Solutions, or “Measurement,” and Impact Marketing Solutions / Gracenote Content Solutions, or “Impact / Content.” Measurement measures viewing and listening of ads and content. Impact connects viewing and listening of advertising to consumer outcomes, and Gracenote enables audience discovery of content and drives key business decision-making around content. Previously, Measurement was referred to as “Audience Measurement” and Impact / Content was referred to as “Outcomes / Content.” ----- Nielsen’s media ratings and position as market currency of choice are supported by market-leading panels and the industry’s largest collection of big data and backed by over 50 years of longitudinal data and intellectual property development.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,One Measurement Solutions,9.5.1,,"Our measurement solutions have evolved along with changes in consumer viewing and listening behavior, enabling Nielsen to capture consumption of ads and content across all available platforms and mediums. _Cross-Media Measurement_ In December 2020, we announced our plans to launch a single, cross-media solution, Nielsen ONE, to drive more comparable and comprehensive metrics across platforms. We believe our transformative cross-media solution will evolve the current metrics that underpin the more than $100 billion video advertising ecosystem using a phased approach. We plan to leverage our existing authority in media measurement to accelerate this new initiative’s growth, with anchor clients that have long-term digital-focused contracts. We expect to be successful in transitioning all or substantially all of the industry to cross-media metrics by the end of 2024. ----- Cross-media measurement is a critical pain point for advertisers. Measurement today often varies by medium, with different units/means of counting applied across varying channels. Further inconsistency is driven by differing definitions of units, which leads to inconsistent reporting and actionability. Given ongoing media fragmentation and massive shifts in consumer viewer behavior, we believe advertisers and publishers want comparable and deduplicated metrics across platforms. With Nielsen ONE, advertisers and publishers will be able to transact using a single metric across linear, digital and streaming that is trusted, independent and standardized across the industry. With a single, consistent, deduplicated number, advertisers will have visibility into total video consumption regardless of platform or device, along with a better understanding of unique audiences, and the ability to better understand frequency and reduce double counting, inflated metrics and advertising waste. Publishers will be able to provide more ad options for buyers and improve the overall viewer experience. We expect that this new offering will improve advertisers’ ability to attribute ad performance and measure ROI by channel. Nielsen ONE will also underpin our Impact Marketing Solutions, thus enabling the industry to optimize media plans and maximize performance across platforms. _Television Audience Measurement_ We are a global leader in television audience measurement, and we believe we are the currency of choice for U.S. broadcasters and cable networks. Advertisers use this information to plan television advertising campaigns, evaluate the effectiveness of their commercial messages and negotiate advertising rates. We provide two principal television measurement services in the United States: measurement of national television audiences; and measurement of local television audiences in local television markets. Our approach combines the scale of big data from set-top-boxes and smart TVs and granular insights from real people through our household panel to deliver comprehensive measurement. Our television panels ensure inclusion across all platforms including cable, satellite, multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPD”), Over-the-air, over the top (“OTT”) streaming and Out-of-Home (“OOH”). The panel is a key competitive advantage that provides persons-level measurement and leverages U.S. census data and sampling to accurately represent the country’s evolving demographics and accurately estimate total television viewership. Using our modernized panel, advanced machine learning models and our identifiers resolution system, Nielsen delivers audience behavior metrics allowing for a more complete view of the media marketplace. We have made significant investments over decades to build an infrastructure that can accurately and efficiently track television audience viewing, a process that has become increasingly complex as the industry has converted to digital transmission and integrated new technologies allowing for developments such as time-shifted viewing. Our measurement techniques are constantly evolving to account for new television viewing behavior, increased fragmentation and new media technologies. The addition of linear addressable impressions to national television measurement will help unlock new value and flexibility for publishers and advertisers to insert addressable ads in any commercial minute they choose. Through Nielsen’s measurement of both targeted and linear audiences, advertisers can better monetize advertising impressions without risking measurement of linear audiences. Our technology is used to measure television viewing in 37 countries, including the United States and countries throughout Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The international television audience measurement industry operates on a different model than in the United States. In many international markets, a joint industry committee of broadcasters in each individual country selects a single official audience measurement provider, which is designated the “currency” through an organized bidding process that is typically revisited every several years. Nielsen believes that its currency will become more global as digital becomes more global. ----- _Digital Audience Measurement_ We are a global provider of digital audience measurement across computers, mobile and streaming via connected devices. Over the past several years Nielsen has experienced rapid growth with many of the leading technology and digital media companies, and these fast-growing entities represent a growing share of Nielsen’s revenue base. We employ a variety of measurement offerings to provide media companies, marketers and brands with metrics to better understand the behavior of digital audiences. In early 2021, Nielsen introduced its new digital methodology that underpins its digital measurement suite. The new methodology leverages Nielsen’s media panel truth sets, census data collection technology, proprietary bias correction and calibration models and diverse thirdparty partner assets. Digital Ad Ratings (“DAR”) provide age and gender audience demographics, with key metrics such as reach, frequency, Gross Rating Points and on-target percentage. DAR is used in 37 countries, with South Korea, Denmark and Sweden being the most recent markets to launch. Overall, Nielsen has the ability to measure approximately 90% of total video digital ad spend across computer, mobile and CTV. _Streaming Measurement_ According to The Gauge, Nielsen’s monthly total TV and streaming snapshot, as of July 2022, consumers now spend approximately 35% of their total TV time engaging with streaming content. To address this growing part of the media landscape, we have a comprehensive suite of streaming solutions through which media buyers and sellers make critical strategy decisions and content creators and studios can make informed programming and content distribution decisions. Additionally, with Nielsen’s offerings, streaming services can prove their audience profile against competitors and guide content and subscriber acquisition strategies. Nielsen Streaming Platform Ratings uses people-powered panels and proprietary metering technology to measure what content is streamed, the device used to stream (e.g., smart TVs, connected devices, video game consoles) and the streaming source application. Nielsen Streaming Content Ratings delivers program and episodelevel measurement. Nielsen’s DAR for CTV delivers audience measurement for streaming ads on CTV devices, with the ability to measure 75% of CTV media spend in the United States. Nielsen Streaming Signals, launched in January 2022, is a real-time, pre-ad insertion signal of who is watching what TV content within a household. By providing person-level demographic predictions of who is watching CTV content (that can include age, gender, race, ethnicity, and geography), we enable more precise and efficient targeted advertising by our CTV clients. ----- _Audio Audience Measurement_ We provide independent measurement and consumer research primarily servicing radio, advertisers and advertising agencies in the audio industry. We estimate the size and composition of radio audiences in local markets and of audiences to network radio programming and commercials in the United States. We provide our syndicated radio ratings services (our local and network radio audience ratings services) in local markets in the United States to radio broadcasters, advertising agencies, and advertisers. Our national services estimate the size and demographic composition of national radio audiences and the size and composition of audiences of network radio programs and commercials. Broadcasters use our data primarily to price and sell advertising time, and advertising agencies and advertisers use our data in purchasing advertising time. We have developed our electronic Portable People Meter (“PPM”) technology, which we deploy across many of our customer offerings and have licensed to other media information services companies to use in their media audience ratings services in countries outside of the United States. We have commercialized our PPM ratings service in 48 of the largest radio markets in the United States. Nielsen’s PPM technology is also used commercially for national television OOH, as well as integrated into local television measurement as of 2019 in 44 local markets in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

According to MoffettNathanson, 2022 estimated U.S. advertising spend is $315 billion, with our main market segments—TV and Digital Video— representing about 25% and 12% of the market, respectively. The TV market, which encompasses both Linear TV and AVOD players, remains the primary medium for broad based audience reach, with entrenched viewership of live events like sports, politics and live news, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% from 2021 to 2025, according to research from MoffettNathanson. At the same time, the Digital Video market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% from 2021 to 2025. This rapid growth is a major driver of overall future advertising spending, creating a distinct need to evaluate Digital Video against the primary advertising medium of TV and a major addressable growth driver for our products and services.

(3) Includes Newspapers, Magazines and Outdoor. ----- Under the ongoing media fragmentation, viewers have more choice and the landscape is growing increasingly complex. Core television viewing is shifting to streaming and it is much tougher to quantify the times of day aspect that previously existed. According to research from eMarketer, U.S. time spent with audio and linear video will decrease at a CAGR of approximately 1% and approximately 8%, respectively, from 2021 to 2025, while time spent with digital content will grow at a CAGR of 6% over the same time period. The demand for our service to help navigate this much more complex environment has increased with the growing relevance of digital-first players and TV clients leaning in as they shift to streaming, blurring the lines between TV and digital. This mix shift increases the importance of having deduplicated view of reach and frequency across platforms, which we believe we are best positioned to provide through Nielsen ONE.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

We are deeply embedded at every step of the advertising value chain and provide myriad further benefits to clients, such as historical like-for-like comparability with over 50 years of Nielsen transactional metrics and easy embedding into networks’ and advertisers’ technology platforms. Our status in the market and offering to customers is underpinned by an unmatched asset base, including our gold standard panel. Our panel provides the gold-standard of measurement, as it is the only measurement capable of accurately measuring person-level viewing and confirmed viewership, correcting errors and biases to provide far more accurate and detailed metrics than big data or third-party census data. Additionally, our panel is the only dataset of sufficient scale to provide statistically significant and representative national and local TV measurement, alongside the granularity and deduplication necessary to capture both total audience and individual numbers. We supplement this gold-standard panel data with the industry’s largest collection of big data, led by a team of more than 500 data scientists. These data scientists oversee the ingestion of more than 14 petabytes of data from more than 7 billion transactions per day via CTV, set top boxes (“STB”) and digital platforms across approximately 35 million households. Our data is cleaned and validated with an identity graph of more than 1 billion devices and 175 million persons and proprietary people-based panels consisting of more than 500,000 people.

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Key Credit Strengths,9.8.3,Highly recurring revenue model with consistent growth,"Our leading positioning is supported by consistent revenue growth and a high reliance on Nielsen’s products among major media clients as the media landscape evolves. Within U.S. media measurement, many contracts are designed as multi-year commitments with annual price escalators and staggered across different expiration years, such that no single year has outsized renewal exposure. This model allows us to enjoy high revenue visibility, with approximately 80% contracted revenue (meaning that 80% of the revenue base entering a given year is already committed under contract), and approximately 85% of Measurement revenue contracted, leading to insulation from recessionary declines. Consequently, we experienced minimal revenue pressure during both the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19, with modest underperformance during COVID-19 driven by short-cycle revenue declines in uncontracted, non-measurement revenue like sports and automotive. Our revenue retention is bolstered by long term client relationships and minimal churn. Of our top five clients, the average length of relationship is more than 30 years. These top five clients accounted for approximately 23% of 2021 revenue and no client accounted for more than 10% or more of our revenue in the same year. Additionally, 100% of our top 10 clients have renewed contracts within the last 3 years. The majority of minimal churn stems from customer closure, especially in shrinking markets like linear local measurement, and bespoke consultancy projects in the Impact division which do not repeat. ----- (1) Reflects organic constant-currency growth, which removes both the net effect of business acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate impact of current segmentation of Media revenue.

We expect approximately $185 million of annualized cost savings as a part of the Transactions. These cost savings opportunities extend across several functional areas of the business. Commercial expense savings are driven by the rightsizing of the existing salesforce to reflect and incorporate a more unified Nielsen ONE measurement methodology as well as a reduction in low performer headcount. Operations expense savings are generated though optimization of panelist recruitment and maintenance practices as well as adoption of further automation in customer care. Apart from these expense categories, we expect additional cost savings associated with streamlining backoffice operations, offshoring initiatives and offshoring third-party vendor spend. None of these identified reductionsin-force are related to the Nielsen ONE organization and the streamlining initiatives will benefit the Company’s transformation objectives. We expect these cost savings initiatives will begin to be actioned upon consummation of the Transactions and will continue over the next 18 to 24 months. Even if we are able to execute the Transactions successfully, this may not result in the full realization of the cost savings that we currently expect, and therefore, we cannot assure you that any anticipated cost savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate.

Although capital expenditures have grown over the past few quarters due to increasing investments in Nielsen ONE development and meters (e.g., Set Meters, People Meters, Active/Passive Meters, PPM’s), we believe the eventual rollout of Nielsen ONE and broader organizational simplification will enable us to reduce capital expenditures in the longer-term. Additionally, we believe the rollout of Nielsen ONE will continue to strengthen our market-leading position and drive additional revenue through the business.

Nielsen, Sr., who invented an approach to measuring competitive sales results that made the concept of “market share” a practical management tool. Initially focused on the consumer packaged goods industry, for more than half a century, we have advanced the practice of media audience measurement to provide our clients a better understanding of their consumers. In January 2011, we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock, and our shares started trading on the NYSE under the symbol “NLSN.” On August 31, 2015, Nielsen N.V., a Dutch public company listed on the NYSE, merged with Nielsen Holdings plc, by way of a cross-border merger under the European Cross-Border Merger Directive, with Nielsen Holdings plc being the surviving company. The merger effectively changed the place of incorporation of Nielsen’s publicly traded parent holding company from the Netherlands to England and Wales, with no changes made to the business being conducted by Nielsen prior to the Merger. In September 2018, we launched an expanded strategic review, covering a broad range of options, including continuing to operate as a public, independent company, a separation of either of Nielsen’s two segments, which consisted of (i) what people watch, or a “Watch” segment (Media), and (ii) what people buy, or a “Buy” or “Consumer Management” segment (Global Connect); or a sale of the company. In November 2018, Nielsen appointed David Kenny as Chief Executive Officer, bringing a leader with a media background to the Company for the first time in its history, who appointed a talented leadership team over approximately the next two years. In November 2019, we concluded our strategic review with intent to spin-off our Global Connect business, enabling sharper strategic focus and greater opportunity for each business to leverage its unique competitive advantages. On November 1, 2020, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement for the Connect Transaction, and on March 5, 2021, we completed the Connect Transaction. We received net proceeds of $2.4 billion on March 5, 2021 and recorded a gain of $489 million net of tax, inclusive of closing adjustments, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Proceeds from the Connect Transaction were primarily utilized for debt repayment, providing greater financial flexibility to execute Nielsen’s growth strategy and expand our role in the global media marketplace. Following the completion of the Connect Transaction, our continuing business operates as a single operating segment and a single reportable segment. Nielsen’s transformation created a company that is more streamlined, growing organically and generating significant cash flow under a media-focused and energized leadership team. ----- (1) Metrics for 2018 (inclusive of Global Connect).

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.17,The Offering,9.17.1,,"_The summary below describes the principal terms of the offering and the Notes. Some of the terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. You should carefully read the “Description of the Notes” for a more detailed description of the offering and the Notes._ Issuer ........................................................... Neptune BidCo US Inc. Notes Offered .............................................. $1,960 million aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured Notes due 2029. Maturity Date ............................................... April 15, 2029; provided that if on April 11, 2029 loans under a Term B Facility (as defined herein) are outstanding, then the Notes will also mature on that date. Interest ......................................................... Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2023. Interest will accrue from the issue date of the Notes. Guarantees ................................................... The Notes will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent and each existing and future wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the Remaining Debt Facilities. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” In addition, the Upstream Entities initially will not guarantee the Notes. If any of the Upstream Entities remain in existence six months after the closing date of the Acquisition, each such Upstream Entity will guarantee the Notes at such time. See “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Guarantees.” Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes, including certain foreign subsidiaries that guarantee the Nielsen Notes, of which an aggregate principal amount of approximately $44 million remain outstanding. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes.” As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our nonguarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 26% of our consolidated revenues, generated approximately 13% of our total operating income, held approximately 28% of our consolidated assets and had long-term debt outstanding of less than $200,000, in each case after intercompany eliminations and without giving effect to the Nielsen Notes. Ranking........................................................ The Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will be: - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral on a pari _passu basis with the First Lien Debt Facilities, the Nielsen Notes_ and all future indebtedness of the Issuer and guarantors secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral; - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including ----- obligations under the Remaining Debt Facilities, the Nielsen Notes and the guarantees thereof; - effectively senior to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness that is unsecured or that is secured by junior liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, including the Second Lien Term Loan; - senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; and - structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary that does not guarantee the Notes, including certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Nielsen Notes rank equally in right of payment with the Notes and are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes. As of September 30, 2022, on a pro forma further adjusted basis as described under “Capitalization,” (i) we would have had approximately $10,504 million of total debt outstanding, (ii) the aggregate amount of such indebtedness that is secured by first priority liens on the Collateral would have been approximately $8,354 million, and so would rank effectively pari passu with the obligations under the Notes to the extent the assets securing such indebtedness constitute Collateral, and (iii) we would have had $650 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary conditions. Any borrowings under the Revolving Facility, once made, would constitute senior secured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, after intercompany eliminations and excluding indebtedness in respect of the Nielsen Notes, our nonguarantor subsidiaries would have had long-term debt outstanding of less than $200,000. Collateral ..................................................... The Notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, which consists of all of the assets that secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the Remaining Debt Facilities and the Nielsen Notes, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens as described herein. The Collateral will exclude certain Excluded Property (as defined under “Description of the Notes”). See “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.” Intercreditor Agreements ............................. Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent for the Notes (such collateral agent, the “Notes Collateral Agent” and any collateral agent holding a security interest for the benefit of the Notes, an “applicable collateral agent”) will become a party to an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the collateral agent under the First Lien Debt Facilities (the “Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”), setting forth therein the relative rights with respect to the Shared Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and covering certain other matters relating to the administration of security interests. Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor ----- Agreement, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent initially controls substantially all matters related to the Shared Collateral, including with respect to decisions or enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the Notes may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders of the Notes. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement also includes waivers of certain important rights that holders of secured debt would otherwise have. The Notes Collateral Agent (and any applicable collateral agent) and the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will become a party to an intercreditor agreement (the “Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the collateral agent under the Second Lien Term Loan (the “Second Lien Collateral Agent”), setting forth therein the relative rights with respect to the Shared Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and covering certain other matters relating to the administration of security interests. Pursuant to the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent initially controls substantially all matters related to the Shared Collateral, including with respect to decisions or enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the Notes may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders of the Notes. The Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement also includes waivers of certain important rights that holders of secured debt would otherwise have. AHYDO Catch-Up Payment ....................... On each interest payment date occurring after the fifth anniversary of the “issue date” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1273-2) (or, if earlier, before the close of any “accrual periods” (as defined in Section 1272(a)(5) of the Code) ending after five (5) years from the date of the issue date), we will redeem a pro rata portion of each outstanding Secured Note in an amount sufficient to ensure that none of the Secured Notes will be an “applicable high yield discount obligation” within the meaning of Section 163(i)(l) of the Code and that none of the Secured Notes shall be treated as having “significant original issue discount” within the meaning of Section 163(i)(2) of the Code (“AHYDO Catch-Up Payment”). This paragraph shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent that none of the Secured Notes will be an “applicable high yield discount obligation” and that none of the Secured Notes will be treated as having “significant original issue discount,” as such terms are defined above. The computations and determinations required in connection with any AHYDO Catch-Up Payment will be made by us in our good faith and reasonable discretion and will be binding upon the holders absent manifest error. Additional Amounts .................................... Any payments made by any non-U.S. Guarantor with respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law in any “relevant taxing jurisdiction,” subject to certain exceptions, the relevant non-U.S. Guarantor will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amounts received by the beneficial owners of the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including in respect of the additional amounts) is not less than the amount that they would have received in the ----- absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” Optional Redemption ................................... The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after October 15, 2025 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal balance of the Notes using the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before October 15, 2025 at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to October 15, 2025, the Issuer may also redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Furthermore, at any time prior to October 15, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the indenture (including any additional Notes issued under the indenture) during any twelve-month period at a redemption price of 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” In the event of certain changes in tax law that become effective after the Issue Date with respect to certain withholding taxes in respect of the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.” Change of Control ....................................... If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, we must offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes— Change of Control.” Mandatory Offer to Repurchase Following Certain Asset Sales ...................................... If we sell certain assets and do not repay certain debt or reinvest the proceeds of such sales within certain time periods, we must offer to repurchase the Notes as described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” Original Issue Discount ............................... The Notes may be treated as issued with more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are treated as issued with OID, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include the OID on the Notes in gross income (as ordinary interest income) as such OID accrues, on a constant yield basis over the term of the Notes, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such OID and regardless of such holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” ----- Certain Covenants…………………………. The indenture governing the Notes will contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to: - incur additional indebtedness; - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to shareholders; - make investments; - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - sell or transfer certain assets; and - agree to certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to the Issuer. These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations. In addition, so long as the Notes have an investment grade rating from any two of Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. we will not be subject to certain of the covenants listed above and the guarantees of the Notes will be released. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” Transfer Restrictions; No Registration Rights ........................................................... Absence of an Established Market for the Notes ............................................................ The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdictions. The Notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S. We do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Notes will be a new class of securities for which there is currently no market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, the initial purchasers are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained. Use of Proceeds ........................................... The net proceeds of the offering will be used together with cash on hand to refinance the Bridge Facility in full. See “Use of Proceeds.” Risk Factors ................................................. You should consider carefully all of the information set forth in this offering memorandum and, in particular, should evaluate the specific factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum and other risks detailed in Nielsen’s filings with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Nielsen has derived the consolidated statements of income data and statement of cash flows data for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2022 from Nielsen’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in (and incorporated by reference in) this offering memorandum, which unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals unless otherwise indicated) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited condensed consolidated financial statements. Nielsen’s historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Nielsen’s historical consolidated financial statements do not reflect the impact of the Transactions or the issuance of the Notes offered hereby. Nielsen’s historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 are presented below after giving effect to the Transactions and assuming that the Notes offered hereby were issued by the Issuer rather than the Bridge Facility in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition as if they had been completed on January 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 is derived by adding the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, and subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived from the financial statements of Nielsen included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and assuming that the Notes offered hereby were issued by the Issuer rather than the Bridge Facility in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” for an explanation of how this information was derived and for the full unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information of Nielsen. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements data has been prepared by our management for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had the Acquisition occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that the Issuer will experience. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and supportable, and do not reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Acquisition that may be derived in future periods.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors that will allow them to evaluate our results using the same measures that management uses to measure and monitor performance and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions Nielsen routinely receives from analysts and investors, and in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data ----- available to all investors. None of the non-GAAP measures presented should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. (2) We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates Nielsen’s performance. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results. No adjustment has been made to foreign currency exchange transaction gains or losses in the calculation of constant currency net income. We define organic constant currency revenue as constant currency revenue excluding the net effect of business acquisitions and divestitures over the past 12 months. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from continuing operations of our condensed consolidated statements of operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, share-based compensation expense and other non-operating items from our condensed consolidated statements of operations, as well as certain other items that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations specifically described below. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period expressed as a percentage of revenues for that period. Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets: We exclude the impact of charges related to the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. We believe that the exclusion of these impairments, which are non-cash, allows for a meaningful measure that increases period-to-period comparability. Share-based compensation expense: We exclude the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense, which is typically non-cash, allows for a meaningful measure that increases period-to-period comparability. Restructuring charges: We exclude restructuring expenses, which primarily include employee severance, office consolidation and contract termination charges to allow for a meaningful measure that increases period-to-period comparability. Furthermore, we exclude these expenses as we believe these expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business. Other non-operating (income)/expense, net: We exclude foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses, primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements, as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses recorded on business combinations or dispositions, sales of investments, net (income)/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and early redemption payments made in connection with debt refinancing. We exclude these non-operating income and expense items as we believe these items in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business. Other items: We exclude certain expenses and gains that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. Such costs primarily include legal settlements and related fees, acquisition related expenses, business optimization costs and other transaction costs. We believe excluding these items allows for a meaningful measure that increases period to period comparability.

We expect these cost savings initiatives will begin to be actioned upon consummation of the Transactions and will continue over the next 18 to 24 months. Even if we are able to execute the Transactions successfully, this may not result in the full realization of the cost savings that we currently expect, and therefore, we cannot assure you that any anticipated cost savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate. See “Summary—Key Credit Strengths—Operation improvement opportunities,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” (4) We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities, less capital expenditures, net. We believe providing free cash flow information provides valuable supplemental liquidity information regarding the cash flow that may be available for discretionary use by us in areas such as the distributions of dividends, repurchase of common stock, voluntary repayment of debt obligations or to fund our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, if any. However, free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows entirely available for discretionary purposes; for example, the repayment of principal amounts borrowed is not deducted from free cash flow. Key limitations of the free cash flow measure include the assumptions that we will be able to refinance our existing debt when it matures and meet other cash flow obligations from financing activities, such as principal payments on debt. Free cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation from consolidated net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

As a consequence, we may not be able to realize cost savings within the timeframe expected or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost savings. Failure to achieve the expected cost savings could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Acquisition. Our presentation of Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum reflects such cost savings but does not reflect such expenditures. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of these adjustments in our Pro forma adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings but rather only as an indication of our current expectations and to show how Adjusted EBITDA will be calculated for the purposes of monitoring covenant compliance in the credit agreements governing our Remaining Debt Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes. In addition, we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with negotiation and consummation of the Transactions. We expect to continue to incur non-recurring costs associated with achieving the desired cost savings. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses consisted of transaction costs related to the Acquisition and include, among others, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, employee benefit costs and filing fees.

In addition, the Equity Investors have the right to designate a majority of the members of our board of directors. As a result, the Equity Investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or shareholders, regardless of whether the holders of Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the Equity Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the Notes.

While the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum is based on assumptions regarding the Transactions and other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, this information is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to, and does not purport to, represent what our actual results or financial condition would have been if the Transactions had been consummated. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum reflects the impact of the Acquisition on our historical financial information using the acquisition method of accounting, as required under GAAP. Pursuant to the acquisition method, we will record our tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of consideration transferred (i.e., purchase price) over the fair value of net assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. The final valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed have not yet been completed. The completion of the valuation upon consummation of the Acquisition could result in significantly different amortization expenses and balance sheet classifications than those presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the guarantees thereof and any related security could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or a guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred its guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or any related security and, in the case of clause (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees; - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees left the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; ----- - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or - the Issuer or such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes or the guarantees and any related security would be subordinated to other indebtedness.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee and any related security was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or security interest, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee or security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the relevant guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee or security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that indebtedness. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

The granting of guarantees by a Luxembourg company must come within its corporate object (objet social). In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of guarantees by a Luxembourg company must be in furtherance of its corporate benefit (interêt social). In particular, it is a criminal offence for managers or directors of a company to use the assets or the credit of a company for a purpose which they know to be against the interest of the company in their personal interest, or in the interest of companies in which they are directly or indirectly interested but there is also a risk that the guarantee could be considered to be null and void. The concept of “corporate benefit” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. There is no relevant Luxembourg case law on the application of this text to intra-group financing transactions, however the Luxembourg legal provision on abuse of corporate assets is identical to the equivalent French statute and Luxembourg courts tend to take French case law into consideration with respect to legal provisions which are similar in both jurisdictions. French case law has developed certain criteria under which a company may, in the absence of a direct own benefit, grant a guarantee for the obligations of another group company without violating French law provisions that are equivalent to article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies. With respect to guarantees, the following criteria, which have been used by the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation), may be used as a general guideline: ----- - the transaction in the context of which the guarantee is granted is entered into with a view to furthering economic, social or financial interests within the framework of a common policy defined for the group of companies as a whole; - the financial commitments (a) are entered into for consideration (not necessarily monetary) and (b) do not disturb the balance between the respective commitments of the group companies; and - the financial commitments do not exceed the financial capabilities of the company which bears the burden of such commitments. The question whether there is sufficient corporate benefit for a company to grant a guarantee is fact-based and is to be assessed by the managers of the relevant company. The provision of a guarantee for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of guarantees in favor of companies who have the same direct or indirect shareholders as the Luxembourg company (cross-stream assistance) and companies who are the direct or indirect shareholder of the Luxembourg company (upstream assistance) are generally considered less likely to directly benefit the guarantor. Hence, guarantees of the debt of affiliates that are not subsidiaries of the guarantor granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities) being included in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures or guarantee agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

An enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exécutoire) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant and subject to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure and the relevant case law. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S. federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules or, at least, the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court); - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and ----- - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi luxembourgeoise). Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change and additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be required by Luxembourg courts in the future. The Luxembourg guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all or some of the managers and executive officers of the Luxembourg guarantors may be non-residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Luxembourg guarantors may be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Luxembourg guarantors, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the applicable collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the applicable collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest or “adequate protection” with respect to such difference.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the applicable collateral agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the issue date of the Notes. Furthermore, the indenture governing the Notes will contain customary exceptions to perfection actions that would be required to be taken in order to perfect a security interest in certain types of Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and additional steps to perfect in such property and rights are taken. If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the Notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, if permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. The Issuer and the guarantors will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Trustee for the Notes or the applicable collateral agent will monitor, or that we will inform such Trustee for the Notes or applicable collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral securing the Notes, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the Trustee for the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent or any other applicable collateral agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute Collateral securing the Notes or monitor the perfection of any security interest, or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest. This may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, the security interest of the applicable collateral agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the applicable collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these ----- consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the applicable collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets.

Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the applicable collateral agents for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor of the Notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency protection after the issue date with respect to the Notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the Notes.

Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly. We have been and will be required to adapt to changing technologies and industry standards, either by developing and marketing new services, investing in new services or by enhancing our existing services to meet client demand. Moreover, accelerating technology turn-over in businesses, the introduction of new services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new regulatory and industry standards could render existing services technologically or commercially obsolete. Our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies, manage and process ever-increasing amounts of data and information, build and apply the appropriate processes to comply with requirements imposed by third parties regarding licensed or collected data, and improve the performance, features and reliability of our existing services in response to changing client, regulatory and industry demands. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design, development, testing, introduction or marketing of our services. Traditional methods of television viewing continue to change as a result of fragmentation of channels and digital and other new television and video technologies; devices such as video-on-demand, digital video recorders, game consoles, tablets, other mobile devices; and the increasing prevalence of alternative distribution systems, such as Internet viewing/OTT delivery and non-ad supported platforms. Commerce across such channels may be less dependent on an independent provider of ad or content measurement, increasing a risk of reduced relevancy and a decrease in the demand for our service. New services, or enhancements to existing services, may not adequately meet the requirements of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance. ----- If we are unable to continue to successfully adapt our media measurement systems to new viewing and consumption habits, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Additionally, adverse economic conditions could affect markets both in the United States and internationally, impacting the demand for our customers’ products and services. Those reduced demands could adversely affect the ability of some of our customers to meet their current obligations to us, hinder their ability to incur new obligations until the economy and their businesses strengthen or cause them to reduce or cease using our services. The inability of our customers to pay us for our services and/or decisions by current or future customers to forego or defer purchases may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows and may present risks for an extended period of time. While we cannot predict the impact of economic slowdowns on our future financial performance, the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. That being said, we have an excellent track record of payment from our clients due to the strict adherence of our payment term and data suspension policies. Our clients, in many situations, require our data to inform their own billings, collections and reconciliations and therefore they prioritize our payment out of their own self-interest.

It is increasingly difficult and costly to recruit households to participate in the surveys, and increased focus by consumers on privacy could result in a greater reluctance to participate in research, which could impact our continued ability to recruit participants. Further, it is increasingly difficult and costly to ensure that the selected sample of households mirrors the behaviors and characteristics of the entire population and covers all of the demographic segments requested by our clients. The COVID-19 pandemic, political changes and trends such as populism, economic nationalism, immigration and sentiment towards multinational companies have made recruiting a sample that mirrors the entire population more difficult. Additionally, as consumers adopt modes of telecommunication other than traditional telephone service, such as mobile, cable and internet calling, it may become more difficult for our services to reach and recruit participants for audience measurement services. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to recruit appropriate participants, maintain the sample sizes and representation in our panels, maintain adequate participation levels or properly model the sample data, our clients may lose confidence in our ratings services and we could lose the support of the relevant industry groups. For example, in September 2021, the Media Rating Council (“MRC”), a voluntary trade organization whose members include many of our key client constituencies, suspended accreditation for our national television ratings and local television ratings services. While we have, and continue to, remediate issues raised by the MRC, MRC accreditation is not automatic, and despite our best efforts, we may not be able to obtain re-accreditation.

Failure to comply with these laws and self-regulatory codes may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, restrictions on further use of data and/or liability under contractual warranties. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) took effect on January 1, 2020, and imposed new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data of persons in California. Because Nielsen does not typically segregate products and services on a state-by-state basis, Nielsen must generally adopt the requirements of CCPA across its U.S. business operations. Failure to meet CCPA requirements could result in penalties of up to $7,500 per violation. CCPA also provides individuals with a limited private right of action in the case of certain breaches of personal data. In 2023, similar laws will take effect in Virginia, Utah, Connecticut and Colorado (which will include penalties of up to $7,500, $7,500, $5,000 and $2,000 per violation, respectively). The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), imposes new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data of persons in the EU. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Many jurisdictions considering new data protection laws are looking to GDPR as a starting point. The proposed EU “ePrivacy” Regulation, if adopted, is expected to have potentially significant impacts for the online/mobile advertising industry as a whole. Nielsen is continuing to monitor the development of the ePrivacy Regulation and industry response and will determine whether to take further action, as needed, following its final adoption. Nielsen is participating in an industry-wide transparency and consent framework mechanism developed by IAB Europe, an industry association for the digital marketing and advertising ecosystem, that facilitates users providing and companies passing consent to the advertising supply chain to address GDPR and ePrivacy notice and consent requirements. Recently, the Belgian Data Protection Authority issued a decision that IAB Europe’s implementation of the framework violates GDPR. IAB Europe has appealed this decision, while also working to address some of the regulator’s concerns. We anticipate that we and other participants will be required to make changes to better align the framework to the regulator’s expectations over the long term, but, at this point, we do not believe the framework will be terminated altogether. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

The loss or limitation of access to that data could harm our ability to provide our products and services.,"We rely on third parties to provide access to certain data and services for use in connection with the provision of our current services and our reliance on third-party data providers is growing. For example, we enter into agreements with third parties to obtain data or facilitate the access to data from which we create products and services. In the digital measurement business, publishers, browsers and platforms are making changes, often citing evolving regulatory requirements and the increased attention on consumer privacy, which may result in our inability to collect the data we need to create our services. This may impact our ability to measure the Web and provide our clients with reporting at the rate of granularity that we do so today, in which case our business and/or potential growth may be affected adversely. We may need to modify or enter into additional agreements with third parties to continue to measure certain types of media and build and apply the appropriate processes to comply with such agreements. In the event we are unable to use such third-party data and services, access the necessary data, or if we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties when necessary, our business and/or our potential growth could be adversely affected. In the event that such data and services are unavailable for our use or the cost of acquiring such data and services increases, our business could be adversely affected. Other suppliers of data may increase restrictions on our use of such data due to factors such as the increasing attention on consumer privacy, the increased rigor of privacy regulation or cybersecurity risk, failure to adhere to our quality control standards or otherwise satisfactorily perform services, increasing the price they charge us for this data or refusing altogether to license the data to us (in some cases because of exclusive agreements they may have entered into with our competitors). For example, large platforms and certain companies are moving away from the use of individual identifiers and utilizing other techniques in connection with consumer privacy and to increase control over their data. As a result, for some of these companies, measurement requires us to work within walled gardens. Working with the walled gardens to implement measurement methodologies may require sharing our panel data and deploying our proprietary technologies in third-party environments and may affect scalability by requiring custom relationships with each platform. Consolidation of our data suppliers could put pressure on our cost structure, thereby leading to decreased earnings and cash flows. Additionally, if any of our suppliers are alleged or confirmed to be in violation of data protection laws or regulations, it may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, and/or restrictions on further use of data to or by Nielsen.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we pivoted to a work from home stance that remains in place for the vast majority of our global workforce to protect our employees’ health and safety. This affects, and may continue to affect, overall business performance. As our measurement services require Nielsen to interact with panelists in order to recruit new panelist households and install metering equipment for existing panelists, over time, the pandemic, actions taken to protect employee health and related social distancing requirements and “stay at home” orders have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Nielsen’s audio and television ratings and measurement services. For example, in September 2021, the MRC suspended accreditation for our national television ratings and local television ratings service, in part due to panel size, which was impacted by our decision to prioritize the health and safety of our panelists and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, compliance with vaccine ----- mandates, to the extent they are imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate, may lead to employee absences, resignations or labor shortages. _COVID-19 Risks Related to Third-Party Providers_ The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused operating challenges and discontinuity for some vendors, suppliers, partners and other third parties, which has affected and may continue to affect their ability to provide us essential products or services. If any of our third-party providers suffer from limited solvency, delays in manufacturing schedule, or delays in shipping because of the pandemic, it could negatively impact our operating model and our business. For example, a lack of equipment due to extended supply chain issues could adversely impact our television audience measurements, our audio audience measurements and our ability to resolve hardware failures quickly, which may disrupt our business. It is not possible to estimate the potential impact at this time. _COVID-19 Risks Related to Demand for Products & Services_ The COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our business as clients cut back on services that are not already contracted, delay their spending, or declare bankruptcy in light of poor business performance due to the pandemic. If the pandemic is not contained or otherwise continues, it will continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. The pandemic, and ongoing uncertainty related to new variants of COVID-19, and the response thereto, including vaccination and booster vaccination efforts, continue to evolve, and we cannot at this time forecast its ultimate duration, severity or impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Our geographic concentration in Florida heightens our exposure to a hurricane, tropical storm or other severe weather events specific to this region. The data centers in locations such as Singapore, also face high physical risks such as cyclones and sea level rise. These weather events could cause severe damage to our property and technology and could cause major disruptions to our operations, including our ability to produce and deliver ratings information. For example, a hurricane or other similar event could lead to business interruption and other adverse consequences such as penalty fees, business interruption claims, lost business or the inability to obtain panelist data from impacted households. While we continue to ensure identified physical risks to our facilities are addressed through the business continuity and our enterprise risk management plans (including ensuring that our GTIC is built in anticipation of severe weather events and we have insurance coverage), if we were to experience a catastrophic loss, we may exceed our policy limits and/or we may have difficulty obtaining similar insurance coverage in the future. As such, hurricanes, cyclones or tropical storms could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, our panels rely on field staff traveling to panelists’ homes for onboarding and troubleshooting; therefore, worsening or more frequent climate change-related weather events could disrupt the size and quality of our panels. With the increased occurrence of climate change-related natural disasters globally, such as droughts, record snowfalls, sea-level rise, heat waves and fires, we recognize the wide-ranging risks this poses to our business continuity in certain locations as well as on a global scale. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

A failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. While many of our services have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, we currently do not have full backup facilities everywhere in the world to provide redundant network capacity in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions we may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities, or delays in our data gathering or panel maintenance operations due to weather events, including those related to climate change, other acts of nature, or public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and to our clients. In addition, any failure by our computer environment to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider. Such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver our services to our clients and could be costly to implement. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements and improvements, or inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed, could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, civil unrest and/or acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which we have offices) could adversely affect our services.

We believe our proprietary technologies and intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position. Any impairment of any such intellectual property could adversely impact the results of our operations or financial condition. We rely on a combination of contractual and confidentiality provisions and procedures, licensing arrangements, and the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries to protect our intellectual property, as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose content, data and technology we license. These legal measures afford only limited protection and may not provide sufficient protection to prevent the infringement, misuse or misappropriation of our intellectual property. Although our employees, consultants, clients, and collaborators all enter into confidentiality agreements with us, our trade secrets, data and know-how could be subject to unauthorized use, misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure. Our business success depends, in part, on: - obtaining patent protection for our technology and services; - enforcing and defending our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property; - preserving our trade secrets and maintaining the security of our know-how and data; and - operating our business without infringing intellectual property rights held by third parties. Our ability to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient and/or changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets. Intellectual property law in several foreign jurisdictions is subject to considerable uncertainty. Our pending patent and trademark applications may not be ----- allowed in certain jurisdictions and inadequate intellectual property laws may limit our rights and ability to detect unauthorized uses or take appropriate, timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct, to protect or enforce our rights. Such limitations may allow competitors to design around our intellectual property rights, to independently develop non-infringing competing technologies, products, or services similar or identical to ours, thereby potentially eroding our competitive position, enabling competitors greater opportunity to capture market share, and consequently negatively impacting our revenues and operating results. The expiration of certain of our patents may also lead to increased competition. As such, our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights, provide significant competitive advantages, or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. The growing need for global data, along with increased competition and technological advances, puts increasing pressure on us to share our intellectual property for client applications with others. For example, certain platforms may require Nielsen to run its proprietary technology within their secure environments, which may require moving Nielsen technology to a third party-controlled environment. In this way, competitors or other third parties may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. Third parties that license our intellectual property and proprietary rights may take actions or create incidents that may diminish the value of our rights, harm our business, reduce revenue, increase expenses, and/or harm our reputation. To prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential and proprietary information by engaging in costly and timeconsuming litigation or other proceedings that may be distracting to management, could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights, and we may not ultimately prevail.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

In the ordinary course of business, third parties may claim, with or without merit, that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights and may engage in legal proceedings against us. In some jurisdictions, plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our services that allegedly infringe a plaintiff’s intellectual property rights. Certain agreements with suppliers or clients contain provisions where we indemnify, subject to certain limitations, the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement based on our data or technology. Infringement claims covered by such indemnity provisions could be expensive to litigate and may result in significant settlement payments. In certain businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and depending upon the outcome of any intellectual property dispute, we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all. Any such claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could: - be expensive and time-consuming to defend; - result in our being required to pay possibly significant damages; - cause us to cease providing our products or services that allegedly incorporate a third party’s intellectual property; - require us to redesign or rebrand our services; and - require us to enter into potentially costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property, although royalty or licensing agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. ----- Any of the above could have a negative impact on our operating results and could harm our financial condition and prospects. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case-by-case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our business and technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court. A claim of intellectual property infringement could compel us to enter into a license agreement with restrictive terms and/or significant fees, which may or may not be available under acceptable terms or at all, and an adverse judgment could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and/or sale of certain of our products or services.

We also contribute to the open source community in certain circumstances, which then may make it difficult or impossible to maintain proprietary rights in such contributions. There are many types of open source licenses, some of which are quite complex, and most have not been interpreted or adjudicated by U.S. or other courts. Although we do have an open source use policy and practice and conduct training around this policy, inadvertent use of certain open source licenses could impose unanticipated limitations upon our ability to commercialize our products and services or subject our proprietary code to public disclosure if not properly managed.

We have been sued by private parties for alleged violations of the antitrust and competition laws of certain jurisdictions. We have changed certain of our business practices to reduce the likelihood of future litigation. Although each of these material prior legal actions have been resolved, there is a risk based upon the leading position of certain of our business operations that we could, in the future, be the target of investigations by government entities or actions by private parties challenging the legality of our business practices. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we are currently subject to securities litigation, which we discuss in greater detail in “Item 3.

Trade issues between the United States and several countries could continue and provide a changing and sometimes challenging landscape. Existing trade tensions with China and other countries may continue and provide challenges and marketplace uncertainty to Nielsen and Nielsen’s clients. Nielsen has been granted an exclusion from tariffs on certain products by the Office of the United States Trade Representative but cannot guarantee the continuation of such exemptions or additional grants of exemptions based on future legislation, regulatory changes or policy shifts in the United States or abroad. Other possible U.S. legislation and regulation that could have an impact on Nielsen include comprehensive state and federal privacy legislation and regulation, artificial intelligence policy, government restrictions on manufacturers within Nielsen’s existing supply chain, competition policy, and accuracy of the decennial Census count and the American Community Survey, which provide a touchstone for Nielsen’s demographics. It is unknown to the extent the U.S. government will want to monitor TV measurement activity as it relates to MRC accreditation. While new legislation that passes into law is unlikely, it is entirely possible public inquiries could be made by Congress or regulatory bodies. The Biden Administration may continue to implement new rules and regulations both emanating from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and the tax code generally. The impact of these potential new rules could be material to our tax provision and value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In Europe, various proposals could impact both competition and privacy. Nielsen will almost assuredly have to monitor and adjust business practices to comply with these changes. The extent to which is unknown. Abroad, a number of jurisdictions, including France and the U.K., have introduced a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in those jurisdictions. While the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has been hosting negotiations with more than 130 countries to adapt an international tax system, if an agreement is not finalized, France and other states could begin to implement the tax in their markets. Its impact on Nielsen’s services remains unclear. The U.K. announced that they will require companies to report on Climate Change by 2025, becoming the first country to make the disclosures mandatory as investors and governments demand corporations curb their greenhouse gas emissions. This means a mandate to report the financial impacts of climate change on our business within the next three years, in addition to the greenhouse gas emissions the current regulation requires reporting on. Also, the new government in the United States is expected to move closer to requiring environmental, social and governance disclosures from companies. Market access issues for Nielsen may also arise in some international markets. Various countries are actively considering changes to the structure of their domestic media measurement regimes for both broadcast and digital services. This can take the form of proposed government audits and/or ownership. This activity also may include stringent regulatory policies on digital content and delivery. The success of such onerous proposals remains uncertain. Policy issues, such as trade, privacy, tax, and market access, will be risks that span the globe.

In addition, the OECD (shortly followed by the EU) finally released the model rules on Pillar Two (Global Minimum Tax) in late December 2021. These new rules provide for some clarity on how taxpayers around the world may be affected by the introduction of Pillar Two as of January 1, 2023. It is possible that these rules could increase the taxes we pay outside the United States. Governments are resorting to more aggressive tax audit tactics and are increasingly considering changes to tax laws or policies as a means to cover budgetary shortfalls resulting from the current economic environment. We are subject to direct and indirect taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. We have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of tax laws, but tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment. Although we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions and tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with some of our interpretations of applicable tax law.

We expect these types of changes, which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes, including the identification, engagement and development and retention of key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business, is critical to our success. This includes developing organization capabilities in specific markets, businesses and functions where there is increased demand for specific skills or experiences. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement.

Competition for highly qualified, specialized technical, managerial, and particularly consulting personnel is intense. Changes to U.S. or other immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may also inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. Further, as a result of our review of strategic alternatives, we may suffer increased attrition. Recruiting, training and retention costs and benefits place significant demands on our resources. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to execute on growth initiatives as well as obtain and successfully complete important client engagements and partnerships and thus maintain or increase our revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Changes in market interest rates, decreases in our pension trust assets or investment losses could increase our funding obligations, which would negatively impact our operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2021, the total benefit liability and the unfunded benefit liability under our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, determined on the GAAP basis, respectively, were $389.2 million and $64 million. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) has the authority to petition a court to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under limited circumstances. In the event our pension plan is terminated by the PBGC, we could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on its own assumptions (which may result in a significantly larger liability than the assumptions used for financial reporting ----- purposes or in determining the annual funding requirements for the plan), and, under certain circumstances, such liability could be senior to the Notes.

The valuation is based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset. The identified intangible assets for the purposes of these pro forma financial statements include customer relationships, computer software, content databases and trade names and trademarks. Customer relationships, computer software, and content databases are finite-lived and are amortized, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives of approximately 7-14 years. Nielsen has preliminarily assigned an indefinite useful life to trade names and trademarks. Additional intangible assets may be recognized as the valuation is completed. The fair value of trade names and trademarks was estimated using a “relief from royalty” method, a form of the income approach. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. Long-term growth rate assumptions are based on long-term industry and economic expectations, adjusted for asset-specific considerations, where appropriate. The fair value of customer-related intangibles was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. The excess earnings method estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the customer-related intangible assets net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. ----- The fair value of computer software was estimated using the replacement cost method. The replacement cost method is a cost approach methodology that uses the estimated replacement or reproduction cost of the computer software as an indicator of fair value. The fair value of content databases has not yet been determined as there are limitations on the type of information that can be obtained prior to the effective time and therefore its carrying value has been used for the purposes of these pro forma financial statements. These preliminary estimates of fair value and estimated useful lives will likely differ from final amounts Nielsen will calculate after completing a detailed valuation analysis, and the difference could have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements. A 10% change in the valuation of intangible assets would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the balance of goodwill and annual amortization expense of approximately $65 million, assuming a weighted-average remaining useful life of 10.4 years. (v) Reflects the adjustment to accounts payable and other current liabilities for settlement of $48 million in accrued interest related to Nielsen’s outstanding indebtedness, accrued transaction costs, and interest payable associated with Nielsen’s interest rate swap derivative liability. The adjustment to accrued interest is for the amount of interest expected to be accrued as of the consummation of the Acquisition, and actual cash paid for accrued interest may vary. These liabilities are not expected to be legally assumed as part of the Acquisition and are instead assumed to be paid prior to closing. (vi) Reflects the adjustment to long-term debt and finance lease obligations and current portion of long-term debt, finance lease obligations and short-term borrowings to extinguish Nielsen’s outstanding indebtedness of the senior secured term loans and senior debenture loans, including any unamortized original debt issuance discounts and original debt issuance costs. (vii) Reflects the adjustment to deferred tax liability resulting from pro forma fair value adjustments of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the applicable blended statutory tax rate of 28% with the respective estimated purchase price allocation. The effective tax rate of the company could be significantly different (either higher or lower) depending on post-merger activities, including cash needs, the geographical mix of income and changes in tax law.

The unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived from the financial statements of Nielsen included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and assuming that the Notes offered hereby were issued by the Issuer rather than the Bridge Facility in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements data has been prepared by our management for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had the Acquisition occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that the Issuer will experience. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and supportable, and do not reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Acquisition that may be derived in future periods. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared to give effect to the Acquisition based on the dates indicated above. In addition to the Acquisition, the pro forma effects of the consummation of other transactions that have occurred or are probable for which disclosure of pro forma financial information would be material to investors have been included herein, such as the use of proceeds and borrowings related to the Acquisition. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information herein has been adjusted to depict the accounting for the Transactions (“Transaction Accounting Adjustments”), which reflect the application of the accounting required by GAAP, linking the effects of the Acquisition to the historical consolidated financial statements. In addition, pro forma adjustments have been presented related to the financing of the Acquisition and other material items. Items not recorded as Transaction Accounting Adjustments are shown in a separate column entitled “Financing & Other Adjustments.” We elected not to present the reasonably estimable synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (“Management’s Adjustments”) and will only be presenting Transaction Accounting Adjustments and Financing and Other Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. Pro forma adjustments for the Transactions were made primarily to reflect: - Transaction Accounting Adjustments: - the Acquisition; - changes in the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities to reflect their estimated fair values at the date of closing of the Acquisition, including values assigned to previously unrecognized intangible assets and related changes in amortization expense; - transaction costs and fees in connection with the Acquisition; and ----- - the effect of the above adjustments on income tax. - Financing and Other Adjustments relate to probable or consummated transactions that are considered to be material to investors: - the cash portion of the Equity Investors’ equity contributions that will be used to fund a portion of the Acquisition, pay related fees and expenses and fund initial operations; - the use of proceeds of the Notes, the Dollar Term Loan Facilities, the Euro Term Facility and the Second Lien Facility to fund a portion of the Acquisition, repay Nielsen’s outstanding indebtedness and pay related fees and expenses, and changes in interest expense resulting from the incurrence of such debt and amortization of estimated debt issuance costs; and - the effect of the above adjustments on income tax. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to reflect what our actual consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance sheet would have been had the Acquisition actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. The Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The acquisition method of accounting requires use of the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering memorandum and the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of the preliminary asset and liability valuations. The actual adjustments to the consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and the actual balance of the net assets on the closing date. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. Any final adjustments will change the allocation of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information, including a change to goodwill. Historical and pro forma earnings per share have not been presented because we do not believe such information is relevant to prospective investors of the Notes hereby offered. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented reflects the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. Under this new standard, deferred revenue acquired in a business combination is measured pursuant to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than its assumed acquisition date fair value. Nielsen early adopted this standard in fiscal year 2022 and therefore will account for the Acquisition under the new standard. The adoption of the standard has no retrospective impact to Nielsen’s historical consolidated financial statements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.2,Critical Accounting Estimates,535.2.1,Revenue Recognition,"Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. We recognize revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, which generally occurs over time. Our customer contracts may include promises to transfer multiple products or services. Determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. Additionally, where there are multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine revenue for each distinct performance obligation. Revenue is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile audience measurement services and analytics, which are used by our media clients to establish the value of airtime and more effectively schedule and promote their programming and our advertising clients to plan and optimize their spend. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied, and control of the service is transferred to the customer. We enter cooperation arrangements with certain customers, under which the customer provides us with its data in exchange for our services. We record these transactions at fair value, which is determined based on the fair value of goods or services received, if reasonably estimable. If not reasonably estimable, we consider the fair value of the goods or services surrendered.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.2,Critical Accounting Estimates,535.2.2,Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets,"Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles was $7,432 million. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. Goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets, consisting of our trade name, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. We review the recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting unit with the respective carrying amount. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily by an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis and supplemented by a market-based approach. A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections. The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings, next year’s revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions. Estimating the fair value of our reporting unit requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable multiples, and determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods, and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment. The 2021 evaluation resulted in no goodwill impairment charges. We used a 2.5% long-term growth rate and 11.2% discount rate in our evaluation. The fair value exceeded carrying value by more than 20% for our reporting unit. We also performed sensitivity analyses on our assumptions, primarily around long-term growth rates and discount rate assumptions. Our sensitivity analyses included several combinations of reasonably possible scenarios regarding these assumptions, including a one percent movement in both our long-term growth rate and ----- discount rate assumptions. When applying these sensitivity analyses, we noted that the fair value was greater than the carrying value for our reporting unit. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of the royalty rate, estimated future revenue (inclusive of long-term revenue growth rates) and discount rate. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets. The discount rates we used in our evaluation was 11.7%. Assumptions about the royalty rate are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. The 2021 evaluation resulted in no impairment charge as the fair value exceeded carrying value. As of the annual impairment assessment, the fair value exceeded carrying value by less than 10%. The valuation is sensitive to the assumptions discussed above. A downward trend in revenue projections or an increase in discount rate could lead to a future impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.2,Critical Accounting Estimates,535.2.3,Amortizable Intangible Assets,"We are required to assess whether the value of our amortizable intangible assets have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. We do not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist. If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method. The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires us to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change. We capitalize software development costs with respect to major internal use software initiatives or enhancements. The costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed, and we consider it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use. Once the software is placed in service, the capitalized costs are generally amortized over periods of three to seven years. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered, a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and as our assessments change. No impairment indicators were noted for other long-lived assets in 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

We have sought to organize the affairs of our subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner, taking into consideration the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we are confident that tax returns have been appropriately prepared and filed, there is risk that additional tax may be assessed on certain transactions or that the deductibility of certain expenditures may be disallowed for tax purposes. Our policy is to estimate tax risk to the best of our ability and provide accordingly for those risks and take positions in which a high degree of confidence exists that the tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authorities. The policy with respect to deferred taxation is to provide in full for temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are computed by assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The carrying value of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to the extent that these deferred tax assets are not considered to be realized on a more likely than not basis. Realization of deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our judgment and various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, our ability to generate future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen and potential tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) imposed a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder and was intended to tax earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to be in excess of certain threshold return. As of December 31, 2018, Nielsen made a policy decision and elected to treat taxes on GILTI as a current period expense and have reflected as such in the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.2,Critical Accounting Estimates,535.2.5,Share-based Compensation,"Our share-based compensation programs are comprised of stock options, performance-based stock options, restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. We measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options, at fair value on the grant date and recognize such costs within the consolidated statements of operations. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment. Sharebased compensation expense for the performance-based stock options is based on the Monte Carlo simulation model which considers factors such as estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock, and the number of share-based awards expected to be forfeited due to future terminations. Some of the critical assumptions used in estimating the grant date fair value are presented in the table below: **2021** **2020** Expected life (years) 5.00 5.00 Risk-free interest rate 0.89% 0.49-1.34 % Expected dividend yield 0.92% 1.16-1.62 % Expected volatility 28.99 37.06% 31.40 % Weighted average volatility 37.06% 30.20 % We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe is representative of future behavior, in estimating the expected life of our options granted. For 2021 and 2020, expected volatility was ----- based on our historical volatility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no time and performance-based stock options issued. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates and, although we believe them to be reasonable, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our optionpricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year. In addition, for our share-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals over an annual or multi-year time period, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.2,Critical Accounting Estimates,535.2.6,Pension Costs,"We provide a number of retirement benefits to our employees, including defined benefit pension plans. The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models. In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the assumed rate of compensation increases. Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates. Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary. The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. For the non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on highquality corporate bonds. We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components. For our U.S. plans, a 50-basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year. We assumed that the weighted averages of long-term returns on our pension plans were 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021, 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets. The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption. Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting our expected return on plan assets. As such, there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Impacts associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates; revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange. The average U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.07 to €1.00 and $1.20 to €1.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The average U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.18, $1.14 and $1.12 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Constant currency growth rates used in the following discussion of results of operations eliminate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations. We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of year-over-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates Nielsen’s performance. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period expressed as a percentage of revenues for that period. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA being a significant measure of performance for management purposes, we also believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may, therefore, have limitations as a comparative analytical tool. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from continuing operations of our consolidated statements of operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, share-based compensation expense and other non-operating items from our consolidated statements of operations, as well as certain other items that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations specifically described below. Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets: We exclude the impact of charges related to the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. We believe that the exclusion of these impairments, which are non-cash, allows for meaningful measure that increases period to period comparability. Share-based compensation expense: We exclude the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense, which is typically non-cash, allows for a meaningful measure that increases period to period comparability. Restructuring charges: We exclude restructuring expenses, which primarily include employee severance, office consolidation and contract termination charges to allow for a meaningful measure that increases period to period comparability. Furthermore, we exclude these expenses as we believe that these expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business. ----- Other non-operating income/(expense), net: We exclude foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses, primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements, as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses recorded on business combinations or dispositions, sales of investments, net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and early redemption payments made in connection with debt refinancing. We exclude these non-operating income/expense items as we believe these items in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business. Other items: We exclude certain expenses and gains that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. Such costs primarily include legal settlements and related fees, acquisition related expenses, business optimization costs and other transaction costs. We believe excluding these items allows for a meaningful measure that increases period to period comparability.

Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Measurement, which increased 3.7%, or an increase of 3.2% on a constant currency basis, with overall solid growth, with strength in national and digital measurement products and local products returning to positive growth. Impact / Content revenues increased 5.4%, or an increase of 3.9% on a constant currency basis. This was driven in part by improving trends in short-cycle revenues, solid growth in Content, and recovery in the Sports business. _Cost of Revenues, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization_ Cost of revenues decreased 1.9% to $1,212 million in 2021 from $1,235 million in 2020, or a decrease of 2.6% on a constant currency basis. The decrease in costs were primarily from the impact of our broad-based optimization plan during 2020 and other productivity initiatives and temporary actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our continued investments in our products and services. _Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization_ Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24.8% to $891 million in 2021 from $714 million in 2020, or an increase of 23.1% on a constant currency basis. The increase in costs were primarily due to our increased costs to operate as a standalone company without the Global Connect business and continued investments in our products and services, partially offset by the impact of our broad-based optimization plan during 2020 and other productivity initiatives, as well as the impact of temporary actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization expense was $512 million in 2021 as compared to $550 million in 2020, inclusive of depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations of $152 million and $165 million, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully amortized and the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations, partially offset by higher capital expenditures during the period. _Impairment of Goodwill and other Long-Lived Assets_ There were no impairment charges in 2021. We recorded a non-cash charge of $58 million for the impairment of other long-lived assets in 2020, related to management’s decision to exit certain smaller, underperforming markets and non-core businesses as well as a change in the extent to which certain self-developed software would be utilized. Also in 2020, we recorded a noncash charge of $88 million for the impairment of an indefinite-lived trade name related to our annual impairment testing. _Restructuring Charges_ On June 30, 2020, we announced a broad-based optimization plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) to drive permanent cost savings and operational efficiencies, as well as to position us for greater profitability and growth. ----- The Restructuring Plan was substantially completed in 2020. Pre-tax restructuring charges in 2021 were $13 million, which primarily related to real estate consolidation, and $37 million in 2020, which primarily related to severance costs associated with employee separation packages. _Operating Income_ Operating income was $872 million in 2021 as compared to operating income of $679 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to the revenue performance discussed above, temporary actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit of permanent cost actions from the Restructuring Plan, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower restructuring charges in 2021, as well as the impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by our increased costs to operate as a standalone company without the Global Connect business. _Interest Expense, Net_ Interest expense was $285 million in 2021 compared to $329 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower loan balances and lower LIBOR rates. _Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gains/(Losses), Net_ Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results. The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.18 and $1.14 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We realized net losses of $5 million and net gains of $17 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions. _Other Expense, Net_ Other expense, net of $24 million in 2021, was primarily related to the write-off of certain previously capitalized deferred financing fees in conjunction with the May 2021 debt refinancing and a loss from a business disposition, partially offset by a gain from the sale of an equity investment. Other expense, net of $20 million in 2020, was primarily related to certain costs incurred in connection with our debt refinancing transactions, as well as the write-off of certain previously deferred financing fees in conjunction with the refinancing, certain non-service related pension costs, and loss from business disposition. _Income from continuing operations before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Affiliates_ Income was $558 million in 2021 compared to income of $347 million in 2020 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above. _Income Taxes_ The effective tax rates in December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 0% and 41%, respectively. Our effective tax rate of 0% in December 31, 2021 was lower than the UK statutory rate primarily as a result of decreases in valuation allowances attributable to the utilization of foreign tax credits and the utilization of net operating losses. Our effective tax rate in December 31, 2020 was higher than the UK statutory rate primarily as a result of withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes. ----- At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $161 million and $128 million, respectively. We also have accrued interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $7 million and $11 million, respectively. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of our provision or benefit for income taxes. It is reasonably possible that a reduction in a range of $131 million to $139 million of uncertain tax positions may occur within the next twelve months, and of this amount, approximately $1 million to $9 million would result in a tax benefit for income taxes as a result of projected resolutions of worldwide tax disputes, filed tax returns, and expirations of statute of limitations in various jurisdictions, along with related interest and penalties. Furthermore, the amounts ultimately paid may differ from the amounts accrued. _Adjusted EBITDA_",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with more assets in use. Depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations decreased to $165 million in 2020 from $166 million in 2019 and is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of operations. _Impairment of Goodwill and other Long-Lived Assets_ During 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of other long-lived assets of $58 million related to management’s decision to exit certain smaller, underperforming markets and non-core businesses as well as a change in the extent to which certain self-developed software would be utilized. We recorded a non-cash charge of $88 million for the impairment of an indefinite-lived trade name related to our annual impairment testing. There were no impairment charges in 2019. _Restructuring Charges_ In June 2020, we announced a broad-based optimization plan to drive permanent cost savings and operational efficiencies, as well as to position us for greater profitability and growth. The plan was substantially completed in 2020. We recorded $37 million in restructuring charges in 2020. These charges primarily related to severance costs associated with employee separation packages. We recorded $30 million in restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance costs associated with our plans to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses and consolidate operations centers, as well as automation initiatives in 2019. _Operating Income_ Operating income was $679 million in 2020 as compared to $870 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by the revenue decrease due to the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above, higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher restructuring charges and the impairment of other long-lived assets in 2020. _Interest Expense, Net_ Interest expense was $329 million in 2020 compared to $342 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to slightly lower USD LIBOR interest rates on our senior secured term loans without hedged positions. _Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gains/(Losses), Net_ Foreign currency exchange transaction gains/(losses), net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results. The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.14 and $1.12 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ----- We realized net gains of $17 million and net losses of $13 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions. _Other Expense, Net_ Other expense, net of $20 million in 2020, was primarily related to certain costs incurred in connection with our debt refinancing transactions, as well as the write-off of certain previously deferred financing fees in conjunction with the refinancing, certain non-service related pension costs, and loss from business disposition. Other expense, net of $77 million in 2019 was primarily related to a non-cash expense of $72 million for pension settlements which included plan transfers to third parties in the Netherlands and UK, where we terminated our responsibility for future defined benefit obligations and transferred that responsibility to the third parties. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements—“Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits”—for more information. _Income from continuing operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Affiliates_ Income was $347 million in 2020 compared to income of $438 million in 2019 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above. _Income Taxes_ The effective tax rates in December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 41% and a benefit of 32%, respectively. Our effective tax rate in December 31, 2020 was higher than the UK statutory rate primarily as a result of withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate benefit in December 31, 2019 was lower than the UK statutory rate primarily as a result of the changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions and audit settlements and decreases in valuation allowances attributable to the utilization of foreign tax credits and the utilization of net operating losses, offset by the unfavorable impact of state and local taxes and base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”). _Adjusted EBITDA_",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Another lawsuit, which alleged similar facts but also named other Nielsen officers, was filed in the Northern District of Illinois in September 2018 and transferred to the Southern District of New York in December 2018. The actions were consolidated on April 22, 2019, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi was appointed lead plaintiff for the putative class. The operative complaint was filed on September 27, 2019, and asserts violations of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements relating to the outlook of Nielsen’s Buy segment (now “Global Connect,” which was sold in the first quarter of 2021), Nielsen’s preparedness for changes in global data privacy laws and Nielsen’s reliance on third-party data. Nielsen moved to dismiss the operative complaint on November 26, 2019. On January 4, 2021, certain of the allegations against Nielsen and its officers were dismissed, while others were sustained. On February 3, 2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve this litigation for $73 million. On March 15, 2022, the terms of the settlement were formalized and submitted to the Court for approval. The terms of the settlement were approved by the Court on July 20, 2022. Nielsen expects the amount of the settlement payment to be paid by its insurance carriers. In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of Nielsen’s current and former officers and directors. The derivative lawsuit alleged that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaint. The derivative lawsuit further alleged that certain officers and directors engaged in trading Nielsen stock based on material, nonpublic information. An amended complaint was filed on May 7, 2021, which Nielsen moved to dismiss on July 16, 2021. After a series of stays, the parties filed a stipulation and order of dismissal, which the Court granted on October 5, 2022. A series of five lawsuits were filed in federal court and one lawsuit was filed in state court by purported Nielsen shareholders against Nielsen and members of our Board of Directors (collectively, the “Actions”) relating to the Transaction. The plaintiffs in three of the Actions filed notices of voluntary dismissal and sent demand letters to Nielsen making substantially the same allegations as were included in the complaints. Five additional demand letters subsequently were sent to Nielsen on behalf of purported Nielsen shareholders, each alleging similar deficiencies in the proxy statement as the Actions. Before the vote on the Transaction, Nielsen filed a supplemental 8-K disclosure addressing the plaintiffs' claims, and the lawsuits were then dismissed. The lone state court action has been settled and fully resolved. Nielsen will now discuss with plaintiffs' attorneys for the remaining claims payment of legal fees to finalize resolution. Based on present information, such payments are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Nielsen’s business, financial position, or results of operations. Nielsen is subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums. Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, the Company does not expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition.

We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign exchange and interest rates. We actively monitor these exposures. Historically, in order to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we entered into a variety of derivative financial instruments, mainly interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward rate agreements. Currently, we only employ basic contracts, that is, without options, embedded or otherwise. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and the value of our net investments in subsidiaries resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. It is our policy not to trade in financial instruments. _Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk_ We operate globally and predominantly generate revenues and expenses in local currencies. Approximately 16% of our revenues and 21% of our operating costs were generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Because of fluctuations (including possible devaluations) in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into our reporting currency, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to transaction exposure. Typically, a one percent change in the U.S. Dollar/Euro exchange rate, holding all other currencies constant, will impact revenues by approximately $2 million annually, with an immaterial impact on our profitability. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net loss of $4 million and $1 million, respectively, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments within other expense/(income), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a net loss of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments within foreign currency exchange transactions gains/(losses), net in our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were $23 million, $29 million and $68 million, respectively.

At September 30, 2022, we had $2,096 million in carrying value of floating-rate debt under our senior secured credit facilities of which $800 million was subject to effective floating-fixed interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2021, we had $2,093 million of floating-rate debt under our senior secured credit facilities, of which $1,050 million was subject to effective floatingfixed interest rate swaps. These derivatives have been designated as interest rate cash flow hedges and fix the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of our variable-rate-debt. A one percent increase in interest rates applied to our floating rate indebtedness would therefore increase annual interest expense by approximately $10 million ($21 million without giving effect to any of our interest rate swaps). In anticipation of the closing of the Transaction, which occurred on October 11, 2022, we terminated all of the outstanding interest rate swaps on October 6, 2022 for net proceeds of $10 million. Derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of non-performance, or credit risk. We do not believe that we currently face a significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments, as these transactions were executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions with a minimum investment-grade or better credit rating. Our credit risk exposure is managed through the continuous monitoring of our exposures to such counterparties. _Equity Price Risk_ We are not exposed to material equity price risk. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

We expect to be successful in transitioning all or substantially all of the industry to cross-media metrics by the end of 2024. Cross-media measurement is a critical pain point for advertisers. Measurement today often varies by medium, with different units/means of counting applied across varying channels. Further inconsistency is driven by differing definitions of units, which leads to inconsistent reporting and actionability. Given ongoing media fragmentation and massive shifts in consumer viewer behavior, we believe advertisers and publishers want comparable and deduplicated metrics across platforms. With Nielsen ONE, advertisers and publishers will be able to transact using a single metric across linear, digital and streaming that is trusted, independent and standardized across the industry. With a single, consistent, deduplicated number, advertisers will have visibility into total video consumption regardless of platform or device, along with a better understanding of unique audiences, and the ability to better understand frequency and reduce double counting, inflated metrics and advertising waste. Publishers will be able to provide more ad options for buyers and improve the overall viewer experience. We expect that this new offering will improve advertisers’ ability to attribute ad performance and measure ROI by channel. Nielsen ONE will also underpin our Impact Marketing Solutions, thus enabling the industry to optimize media plans and maximize performance across platforms. _Television Audience Measurement_ We are a global leader in television audience measurement, and we believe we are the currency of choice for U.S. broadcasters and cable networks. Advertisers use this information to plan television advertising campaigns, evaluate the effectiveness of their commercial messages and negotiate advertising rates. We provide two principal television measurement services in the United States: measurement of national television audiences; and measurement of local television audiences in local television markets. Our approach combines the scale of big data from set-top-boxes and smart TVs and granular insights from real people through our household panel to deliver comprehensive measurement. Our television panels ensure inclusion across all platforms including cable, satellite, MVPD, Over-the-air, OTT streaming and OOH. The panel is a key competitive advantage that provides persons-level measurement and leverages U.S. census data and sampling to accurately represent the country’s evolving demographics and accurately estimate total television viewership. Using our modernized panel, advanced machine learning models and our identifiers resolution system, Nielsen delivers audience behavior metrics allowing for a more complete view of the media marketplace. We have made significant investments over decades to build an infrastructure that can accurately and efficiently track ----- television audience viewing, a process that has become increasingly complex as the industry has converted to digital transmission and integrated new technologies allowing for developments such as time-shifted viewing. Our measurement techniques are constantly evolving to account for new television viewing behavior, increased fragmentation and new media technologies. The addition of linear addressable impressions to national television measurement will help unlock new value and flexibility for publishers and advertisers to insert addressable ads in any commercial minute they choose. Through Nielsen’s measurement of both targeted and linear audiences, advertisers can better monetize advertising impressions without risking measurement of linear audiences. Our technology is used to measure television viewing in 37 countries, including the United States and countries throughout Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The international television audience measurement industry operates on a different model than in the United States. In many international markets, a joint industry committee of broadcasters in each individual country selects a single official audience measurement provider, which is designated the “currency” through an organized bidding process that is typically revisited every several years. Nielsen believes that its currency will become more global as digital becomes more global. _Digital Audience Measurement_ We are a global provider of digital audience measurement across computers, mobile and streaming via connected devices. Over the past several years Nielsen has experienced rapid growth with many of the leading technology and digital media companies, and these fast-growing entities represent a growing share of Nielsen’s revenue base. We employ a variety of measurement offerings to provide media companies, marketers and brands with metrics to better understand the behavior of digital audiences. In early 2021, Nielsen introduced its new digital methodology that underpins its digital measurement suite. The new methodology leverages Nielsen’s media panel truth sets, census data collection technology, proprietary bias correction and calibration models and diverse thirdparty partner assets. DAR provides age and gender audience demographics, with key metrics such as reach, frequency, Gross Rating Points and on-target percentage. DAR is used in 37 countries, with South Korea, Denmark and Sweden being the most recent markets to launch. Overall, Nielsen has the ability to measure approximately 90% of total video digital ad spend across computer, mobile and CTV. ----- _Streaming Measurement_ According to The Gauge, Nielsen’s monthly total TV and streaming snapshot, as of July 2022, consumers now spend approximately 35% of their total TV time engaging with streaming content. To address this growing part of the media landscape, we have a comprehensive suite of streaming solutions through which media buyers and sellers make critical strategy decisions and content creators and studios can make informed programming and content distribution decisions. Additionally, with Nielsen’s offerings, streaming services can prove their audience profile against competitors and guide content and subscriber acquisition strategies. Nielsen Streaming Platform Ratings uses people-powered panels and proprietary metering technology to measure what content is streamed, the device used to stream (e.g., smart TVs, connected devices, video game consoles) and the streaming source application. Nielsen Streaming Content Ratings delivers program and episodelevel measurement. Nielsen’s DAR for CTV delivers audience measurement for streaming ads on CTV devices, with the ability to measure 75% of CTV media spend in the United States. Nielsen Streaming Signals, launched in January 2022, is a real-time, pre-ad insertion signal of who is watching what TV content within a household. By providing person-level demographic predictions of who is watching CTV content (that can include age, gender, race, ethnicity, and geography), we enable more precise and efficient targeted advertising by our CTV clients. _Audio Audience Measurement_ We provide independent measurement and consumer research primarily servicing radio, advertisers and advertising agencies in the audio industry. We estimate the size and composition of radio audiences in local markets and of audiences to network radio programming and commercials in the United States. We provide our syndicated radio ratings services (our local and network radio audience ratings services) in local markets in the United States to radio broadcasters, advertising agencies, and advertisers. Our national services estimate the size and demographic composition of national radio audiences and the size and composition of audiences of network radio programs and commercials. Broadcasters use our data primarily to price and sell advertising time, and advertising agencies and advertisers use our data in purchasing advertising time. We have developed our electronic PPM technology, which we deploy across many of our customer offerings and have licensed to other media information services companies to use in their media audience ratings services in countries outside of the United States. We have commercialized our PPM ratings service in 48 of the largest radio markets in the United States. Nielsen’s PPM technology is also used commercially for national television OOH, as well as integrated into local television measurement as of 2019 in 44 local markets in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.40,Key Credit Strengths,535.40.1,Large and growing underlying market,"We primarily operate in the large and growing U.S. advertising market. According to MoffettNathanson, 2022 estimated U.S. advertising spend is $315 billion, with our main market segments—TV and Digital Video— representing about 25% and 12% of the market, respectively. The TV market, which encompasses both Linear TV and AVOD players, remains the primary medium for broad based audience reach, with entrenched viewership of live events like sports, politics and live news, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% from 2021 to 2025, according to research from MoffettNathanson. At the same time, the Digital Video market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% from 2021 to 2025. This rapid growth is a major driver of overall future advertising spending, creating a distinct need to evaluate Digital Video against the primary advertising medium of TV and a major addressable growth driver for our products and services. ----- Source: MoffettNathanson and eMarketer. (1) Includes YouTube, Snap and portions of other social media platforms. (2) Includes search, Google Network, and portions of social media platforms. (3) Includes Newspapers, Magazines and Outdoor. Under the ongoing media fragmentation, viewers have more choice and the landscape is growing increasingly complex. Core television viewing is shifting to streaming and it is much tougher to quantify the times of day aspect that previously existed. According to research from eMarketer, U.S. time spent with audio and linear video will decrease at a CAGR of approximately 1% and approximately 8%, respectively, from 2021 to 2025, while time spent with digital content will grow at a CAGR of 6% over the same time period. The demand for our service to help navigate this much more complex environment has increased with the growing relevance of digital-first players and TV clients leaning in as they shift to streaming, blurring the lines between TV and digital. This mix shift increases the importance of having deduplicated view of reach and frequency across platforms, which we believe we are best positioned to provide through Nielsen ONE.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

We are deeply embedded at every step of the advertising value chain and provide myriad further benefits to clients, such as historical like-for-like comparability with over 50 years of Nielsen transactional metrics and easy embedding into networks’ and advertisers’ technology platforms. Our status in the market and offering to customers is underpinned by an unmatched asset base, including our gold standard panel. Our panel provides the gold-standard of measurement, as it is the only measurement capable of accurately measuring person-level viewing and confirmed viewership, correcting errors and biases to provide far more accurate and detailed metrics than big data or third-party census data. Additionally, our panel is the only dataset of sufficient scale to provide statistically significant and representative national and local TV measurement, alongside the granularity and deduplication necessary to capture both total audience and individual numbers. We supplement this gold-standard panel data with the industry’s largest collection of big data, led by a team of more than 500 data scientists. These data scientists oversee the ingestion of more than 14 petabytes of data from more than 7 billion transactions per day via CTV, STB and digital platforms across approximately 35 million households.

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.40,Key Credit Strengths,535.40.3,Highly recurring revenue model with consistent growth,"Our leading positioning is supported by consistent revenue growth and a high reliance on Nielsen’s products among major media clients as the media landscape evolves. Within U.S. media measurement, many contracts are designed as multi-year commitments with annual price escalators and staggered across different expiration years, such that no single year has outsized renewal exposure. This model allows us to enjoy high revenue visibility, with approximately 80% contracted revenue (meaning that 80% of the revenue base entering a given year is already committed under contract), and approximately 85% of Measurement revenue contracted, leading to insulation from recessionary declines. Consequently, we experienced minimal revenue pressure during both the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19, with modest underperformance during COVID-19 driven by short-cycle revenue declines in uncontracted, non-measurement revenue like sports and automotive. Our revenue retention is bolstered by long term client relationships and minimal churn. Of our top five clients, the average length of relationship is more than 30 years. These top five clients accounted for approximately 23% of 2021 revenue and no client accounted for more than 10% or more of our revenue in the same year. Additionally, 100% of our top 10 clients have renewed contracts within the last 3 years. The majority of minimal churn stems from customer closure, especially in shrinking markets like linear local measurement, and bespoke consultancy projects in the Impact division which do not repeat.

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,535,COVID-19,535.40,Key Credit Strengths,535.40.4,Operational improvement opportunities,"We have identified and intend to implement a robust set of cost savings opportunities that will improve our operating efficiency and better align the Company’s cost structure with our long-term strategic goals. We expect approximately $185 million of annualized cost savings as a part of the Transactions. These cost savings opportunities extend across several functional areas of the business. Commercial expense savings are driven by the rightsizing of the existing salesforce to reflect and incorporate a more unified Nielsen ONE measurement methodology as well as a reduction in low performer headcount. Operations expense savings are generated though optimization of panelist recruitment and maintenance practices as well as adoption of further automation in customer care. Apart from these expense categories, we expect additional cost savings associated with streamlining backoffice operations, offshoring initiatives and offshoring third-party vendor spend. None of these identified reductionsin-force are related to the Nielsen ONE organization and the streamlining initiatives will benefit the Company’s transformation objectives. We expect these cost savings initiatives will begin to be actioned upon consummation of ----- the Transactions and will continue over the next 18 to 24 months. Even if we are able to execute the Transactions successfully, this may not result in the full realization of the cost savings that we currently expect, and therefore, we cannot assure you that any anticipated cost savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate.

Although capital expenditures have grown over the past few quarters due to increasing investments in Nielsen ONE development and meters (e.g., Set Meters, People Meters, Active/Passive Meters, PPM’s), we believe the eventual rollout of Nielsen ONE and broader organizational simplification will enable us to reduce capital expenditures in the longer-term. Additionally, we believe the rollout of Nielsen ONE will continue to strengthen our market-leading position and drive additional revenue through the business.

When we operate in a culture that is diverse and inclusive, our hope is that innovation flourishes, our clients win, and associates are engaged and collaborate to bring the best that Nielsen can offer to the diverse audiences that we measure. Nielsen’s DE&I strategy covers four pillars: _People_ - We aim to build a globally inclusive and impactful culture at Nielsen. This means increasing diverse representation among employees, providing equitable growth opportunities for diverse employees, hiring from diverse talent pools and expanding our inclusive hiring practices. We have set public 2024 goals for representation of women in global leadership, U.S. Black mid-level leadership and U.S. Hispanic leadership. - We are investing in diverse talent development programs, including leadership development cohorts to help us meet our representation goals and the Diverse Leadership Network (“DLN”), a 12-month leadership development program designed to strengthen and diversify our leadership pipeline. - We support 14 internal business resource groups (“BRGs”), with over 3,500 members around the world. Our BRGs engage employees in programming that drives Nielsen’s advocacy, educational outreach and business growth, which results in increased impact on local business and the communities where we work. _Product & Thought Leadership_ - Building on our role as the trusted source of measurement on media behaviors, content attributes, and industry trends across all platforms, we focus on diverse insights and inclusive intelligence to better understand the audience. - Through thought leadership, we aim to address the industry’s critical questions around diversity, equity and inclusion, using Nielsen’s products and solutions that measure audiences and content. - In February 2022, we launched a Diverse Media Equity program. As part of our commitment to creating a better media future for all people, we expect to raise the visibility of diverse-owned media that play a critical role in reaching and representing the increasingly diverse population. _Business Diversity_ - Nielsen’s values-inclusion, courage, growth-are the foundation of our business. Our mission is to buy better: to engage, include and contract with diverse business partners who have the perspectives, expertise and products/services that will help us create a better media future for all people. - We track and report diverse spend and have multiple policies and processes to support a corporate goal of 15% U.S. spend with diverse businesses by the end of 2022. In 2020, we exceeded our corporate goal of 10% of U.S. sourceable spend on diverse suppliers and subsequently set a new goal of 15% by 2022. In 2021, we met that 15% with $104 million in spending with diverse suppliers. Our continued goal is to maintain our 15% target through 2024, with a stretch goal of 18%. ----- _Community Advocacy_ - In the markets where we do business, we nurture relationships with community leaders and organizations, such as the LEAD Network and Valuable 500 so that we can best serve diverse communities. - To ensure that we have an outside-in perspective, we created an External Advisory Council (“EAC”) representing media industry leaders from diverse communities. The EAC provides input, ideas, recommendations and opportunities through a DE&I lens to benefit our people, work, clients and communities.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.6,Security for the Secured Notes,21.6.7,First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,"The Notes Collateral Agent will become a party to an existing first lien intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) by and among, inter alia, the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral constituting Shared Collateral, which agreement is acknowledged by the Company and the Guarantors and may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture, the Rollover Neptune Notes Indentures, the First Lien Credit Agreement and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any Person authorized by it) may act with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the ----- Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent for the Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) at any time when the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect to such Shared Collateral, the First Lien Credit Agreement Secured Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Series of First Lien Secured Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative for such Shared Collateral. The “Applicable Authorized Representative” means with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent and (ii) from and after the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the entity that was, prior to such Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative. The “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Authorized Representative of the Series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (including the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral, other than the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which the Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, that if there are two outstanding Series of Additional First Lien Obligations with equal outstanding principal amounts, the Series of Additional First Lien Obligations with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have a larger outstanding principal amount for purposes of this definition. With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other NonControlling Secured Party shall commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Document, applicable law or otherwise. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonControlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an “event of default” with respect to the applicable Additional First Lien Obligations under which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an “event of default” with respect to its Additional First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (A) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or any material portion thereof or (B) at any time the Company, Parent or any other Guarantor which has granted a security interest in any such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the NonControlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or ----- remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral. Only the Controlling Agent may act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Obligations owed to such holder; (ii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the secured parties that are represented by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any the secured parties represented thereby to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral, subject to the waterfall provisions below. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also agreed that it will not (and will waive any right to) challenge, question or contest or support any other Person in challenging, questions or contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the validity, value or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or any security documents constituting First Lien Documents or the perfection, priority, validity, value, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral. No NonControlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will seek, and hereby waives any right, to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any insolvency and solvency proceeding of the Company (including any adequate protection payments), Parent or any other Guarantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or distribution in respect thereof in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or any payment received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to such Shared Collateral (subject, in the case of any such payment, proceeds, or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Shared Collateral and all such payments, distributions, and proceeds of any such payment or distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied: (i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any applicable First Lien Document, (ii) second, subject to the provisions below applicable to Impairment, to the payment in full in cash of the First Lien Obligations of each Series secured by a valid and perfected Lien on such Shared Collateral on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that, following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to any Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph, in the event that the ----- value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding; and (iii) third, after payment in full of all First Lien Obligations, to the Company and the Guarantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) shall bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); _provided, that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any real property subject to a mortgage that applies_ to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of any bankruptcy law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of ----- First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided, that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above, subject to the Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties on the same rights and priorities as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. _Certain limitations applicable in bankruptcy proceedings_ The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become subject to an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such Guarantor under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law, each Authorized Representative (other than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (in the case of any Collateral Agent other than the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral (in each case, except to the extent a Lien on additional collateral is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive a Lien on such additional collateral), with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent a payment is made to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such adequate protection); provided, that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement does not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not (other than as a provider of DIP Financing) object to or oppose (or support any other Person in objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. ----- The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.6,Security for the Secured Notes,21.6.11,Certain bankruptcy limitations,"The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by any applicable bankruptcy law in the event that any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral (and in some cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be materially delayed). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Secured Notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the First Lien Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Secured Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate protection during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Secured Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Secured Notes owned by the Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Notice of any redemption of the Secured Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such ----- redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid to the Person in whose name the Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Secured Note or Note Guarantees thereof is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the paying agent);

provided, however, that (A) if a beneficial owner is not the holder of the Secured Notes, the Additional Amounts payable to such beneficial owner in respect of any Tax shall not exceed the Additional Amounts that would have been payable to such beneficial owner in respect of such Tax had the beneficial owner been the holder and (B) no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed, deducted or withheld but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been resident for tax purposes, or being or having been a citizen or domiciliary or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or having a place of management in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Secured Note, the Secured Indenture or a Note Guarantee thereof;

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with applicable law. In such event, the Payor will provide promptly to the Trustee (with a copy to the paying agent) certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, other evidence of such payments reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. Such documentation shall be made available to the holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the paying agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note Guarantees, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the paying agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the paying agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter).

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Secured Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Secured Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Secured Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Secured Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Secured Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Secured Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our ----- capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Secured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Secured Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Secured Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Secured Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Secured Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” The Company shall not be permitted to designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary during a Suspension Period unless such designation would be permitted if the Suspension Period was not in effect. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period (to the extent not entered into in contemplation of the Reversion Date) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, during a Suspension Period any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be suspended; provided that such obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period.

provided that for the purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or until the Company revokes an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount; (10) [Reserved]; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant or any other covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to ----- be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, shall in each case be deemed to be a permitted Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Secured Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall require the Company to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Acquisition Closing Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $761.4 million and 45.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions of the Secured Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes. The First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Secured Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”); and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $507.6 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time outstanding;

or (9) Parent, the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports” would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes Collateral Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Secured Indenture and discharge of the Secured Indenture, the release of the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents). However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes notify the Company of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Secured Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such ----- Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Secured Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “— Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Secured Indenture. Any time period in the Secured Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. ----- Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Secured Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Secured Indenture, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, at its office specified in the Secured Indenture and such notice references the Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default”.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and ----- settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture governing the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture governing the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names Notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or ----- (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to or from DTC, as applicable. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.1,U.S. Holders,327.1.1,,"The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations to a U.S. Holder of the ownership and disposition of the Notes. For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) a valid election is in place under applicable Regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust. _Stated Interest_ Stated interest on a Note will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. _Original Issue Discount_ If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily-defined de minimis threshold (generally, 1/4 of 1% of the stated principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date), then the Notes will be considered to be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID on the Notes generally is equal to the excess of the Notes’ stated principal amount over the issue price. If the Notes are considered to be issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include the OID with respect to the Notes in gross income (as ordinary interest income) as such OID accrues, on a constant yield basis over the term of the Notes, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such OID and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ----- The amount of OID, if any, includible in income by a U.S. Holder for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds such Note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s yield to maturity (appropriately adjusted to reflect the length of such accrual period), less (b) the stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note as of the beginning of any accrual period will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID, if any. The “yield to maturity” of a Note is the discount rate that causes the present value of all payments on the Note as of its original issue date to equal the “issue price” of such Note. The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the OID rules in the event the Notes are treated as having OID. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition_ Except with respect to an AHYDO Catch-Up Payment (as discussed in the following paragraph), upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the Note, less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as described above under “— Stated Interest”) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such U.S. Holder, increased by any OID included in income by such U.S. Holder with respect to such Note, and decreased by any AHYDO Catch-Up Payment previously made with respect to any portion such Note. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of individual and other noncorporate U.S. Holders are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Each U.S. Holder should consult its tax advisor as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances. The Company intends to treat an AHYDO Catch-Up Payment as a payment of accrued OID with respect to the entirety of a Note (including the portion of such Note not being redeemed) and not as a payment in redemption of a portion of such Note. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ In general, the applicable withholding agent must report certain information to the IRS with respect to payments of stated interest, accruals of OID, if any, and payments of the proceeds of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes, to certain U.S. Holders. The applicable withholding agent also may be required to impose backup withholding (currently at the rate of 24%), if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the applicable withholding agent or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the applicable withholding agent that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against that U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

For purposes of this summary, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder. As discussed above in “—U.S. Holders—Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition,” the Company intends to treat an AHYDO Catch-Up Payment as a payment of accrued OID with respect to the entirety of a Note (including the portion of such Note not being redeemed) and not as a payment in redemption of a portion of such Note. _U.S. Federal Withholding Tax_ Subject to the discussion of FATCA (as defined below), interest (which, for purposes of this discussion of Non-U.S. Holders, includes any OID) paid on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that: - interest paid on the Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; - the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or constructively; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank that acquired the Notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and - either (a) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address on a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E delivered to the applicable withholding agent, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person as defined under the Code or (b) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its Notes through certain intermediaries and satisfies the certification requirements under applicable Regulations. If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to such Non-U.S. Holder on the Notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E (or other applicable form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or IRS Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax”). Subject to the discussion below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax” and the discussion of FATCA (as defined below), the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than amounts properly attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be treated as described below). _U.S. Federal Income Tax_ Unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, if a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on a Note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although such Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—U.S. Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied) in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. person as defined under the Code. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a ----- corporation, such Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. Subject to the discussion of FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than in respect of any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, which is subject to the rules discussed above), unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (in which case, such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (and possibly the branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as applies to effectively connected interest income described above), or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition of a Note and certain other requirements are met (in which case, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable income tax treaty rate applies) on any such Non-U.S. Holder’s gain (net of certain U.S.-source losses, if any).",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

In addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as: - banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; - persons subject to Section 451(b) of the Code; - dealers or traders in securities; - brokers; - traders that have elected mark-to-market tax accounting treatment; - retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts; - tax-exempt entities; - S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities; - real estate investment trusts; - regulated investment companies; - non-U.S. trusts or estates with U.S. beneficiaries; - U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - investors that hold the Notes as part of a straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction; ----- - controlled foreign corporations; - passive foreign investment companies; - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; - U.S. Holders who hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries; and - former citizens or residents of the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code. In the case of a holder of Notes that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the Notes to the partnership or a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes should consult its tax advisor regarding an investment in the Notes. The following summary is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Each Investor considering an investment in the Notes should consult its tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to such investor’s particular situations, as well as any tax considerations arising under any other U.S. federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.1,General Fiduciary Matters,107.1.1,,"ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and provisions of any Similar Law to such an investment, and to confirm that the acquisition and holding of the Notes will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law or whether an exemption would be applicable to such acquisition and holding. In addition, in considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each Plan should also consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any guarantors or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide any investment advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389
1261,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) who engages in a non-exempt prohibited ----- transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which an Issuer, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the Notes are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied with respect to transactions involving the Notes. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for Plans in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular Plan. Neither this discussion nor anything in this offering memorandum is or is intended to be investment advice directed at any potential purchaser that is a Plan or at such purchasers generally. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Upon designation as held for sale, we record the carrying value of an asset at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. In accordance with GAAP, assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortized. If the disposal of the component of an entity (or group of components) represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results, it meets the criteria for discontinued operations. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction, are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The expenses included in the results of discontinued operations are the direct operating expenses incurred by the discontinued segment that may be reasonably segregated from the costs of the ongoing operations of the Company. Certain corporate costs directly attributable to the discontinued operations and transaction costs directly related to the sale are also presented within net income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes.

Revenue Recognition,2676.21.1,,"Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, which generally occurs over time. Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable. Revenue is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile audience measurement services and analytics, which are used by the Company’s clients to establish the value of airtime and more effectively schedule and promote their programming and the Company’s advertising clients to plan and optimize their spending. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied and control of the service is transferred to the customer. The Company enters into cooperation arrangements with certain customers, under which the customer provides Nielsen with its data in exchange for Nielsen’s services. Nielsen records these transactions at fair value, which is determined based on the fair value of goods or services received, if reasonably estimable. If not reasonably estimable, the Company considers the fair value of the goods or services surrendered.

The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 66% of these remaining performance obligations through December 31, 2023, with the balance recognized thereafter. _Deferred Costs_ Incremental direct costs incurred to build the infrastructure to service new contracts are capitalized as a contract cost. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balances of such capitalized costs were $53 million and $31 million, respectively. These costs are typically amortized through cost of revenues over the original contract period beginning when the infrastructure to service new clients is ready for its intended use. We amortized $0.3 million and $1 million of these costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.

There were no indicators of impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the first quarter of 2021, pursuant to Nielsen’s sale of its Global Connect business (such business, “Global Connect,” and the sale of Global Connect, the “Connect Transaction”) to affiliates of Advent International Corporation (“Advent”) on March 5, 2021, Nielsen granted Advent a license to brand its products and services with the Nielsen name and other trademarks for 20 years following the closing of the Connect Transaction. There was an indefinite-lived trade name historically recognized within the Global Connect segment. However, as this indefinite-lived trade name was retained by Nielsen as part of the Connect Transaction, the trade name was included within continuing operations. During the first quarter of 2021, Nielsen concluded that there was a triggering event for an interim impairment assessment as a result of the change in unit of account of the indefinite-lived intangibles as a result of the sale of Global Connect. The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates, estimated future revenue (inclusive of long-term revenue growth rates) and discount rate. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets. The discount rate Nielsen used in its evaluation was 10.1%. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. Based on the interim impairment assessment as of September 2021, Nielsen concluded that the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value, thus no impairment was recorded. Nielsen will continue to closely evaluate and report on any indicators of future impairments. There was no impairment or indicators of impairment noted in 2022 with respect to the Company’s amortizable intangible assets. Nielsen will continue to closely evaluate and report on any indicators of future impairments.

Fair Value Measurements,2676.35.1,Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis,"The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments and long-term debt. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. In addition, the Company records changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values in net income rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are recognized at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The adjustments related to the observable price changes will also be recognized in net income.

When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. Nielsen documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions as well as the hedge effectiveness assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis. Nielsen recognizes all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met, Nielsen recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Nielsen manages exposure to possible defaults on derivative financial instruments by monitoring the concentration of risk that Nielsen has with any individual bank and through the use of minimum credit quality standards for all counterparties. Nielsen does not require collateral or other security in relation to derivative financial instruments. A derivative contract entered into between Nielsen or certain of its subsidiaries and a counterparty that was also a lender under Nielsen’s senior secured credit facilities at the time the derivative contract was entered into is guaranteed under the senior secured credit facilities by Nielsen and certain of its subsidiaries (See Note 7 – Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements for more information). Since it is Nielsen’s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with banks of internationally acknowledged standing, Nielsen considers the counterparty risk to be remote. It is Nielsen’s policy to have an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement established with every bank with which it has entered into any derivative contract. Under each of these ISDA Master Agreements, Nielsen agrees to settle only the net amount of the combined market values of all derivative contracts outstanding with any one counterparty should that counterparty default. Certain of the ISDA Master Agreements contain cross-default provisions pursuant to which the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if the Company either defaults in payment obligations under its credit facility or if such obligations are accelerated by the lenders. At September 30, 2022, Nielsen had no material exposure to potential economic losses due to counterparty credit default risk or cross-default risk on its derivative financial instruments. _Foreign Currency Exchange Risk_ For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, Nielsen recorded a net loss of $4 million and $1 million, respectively, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments within other expense/(income), net in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amounts of the outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were $23 million and $29 million, respectively. _Interest Rate Risk_ Nielsen is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on the floating-rate U.S. Dollar Loans, and uses floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure. For these derivatives, Nielsen reports the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had the following U.S. Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate outstanding interest rate swaps designated as hedges utilized in the management of its interest rate risk:",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held exclusive of any transaction costs.

The actions were consolidated on April 22, 2019, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi was appointed lead plaintiff for the putative class. The operative complaint was filed on September 27, 2019, and asserts violations of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements relating to the outlook of Nielsen’s Buy segment (now “Global Connect,” which was sold in the first quarter of 2021), Nielsen’s preparedness for changes in global data privacy laws and Nielsen’s reliance on third-party data. Nielsen moved to dismiss the operative complaint on November 26, 2019. On January 4, 2021, certain of the allegations against Nielsen and its officers were dismissed, while others were sustained. On February 3, 2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve this litigation for $73 million. On March 15, 2022, the terms of the settlement were formalized and submitted to the Court for approval. The terms of the settlement were approved by the Court on July 20, 2022. Nielsen expects the amount of the settlement payment to be paid by its insurance carriers. In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of Nielsen’s current and former officers and directors. The derivative lawsuit alleged that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaint. The derivative lawsuit further alleged that certain officers and directors engaged in trading Nielsen stock based on material, nonpublic information. An amended complaint was filed on May 7, 2021, which Nielsen moved to dismiss on July 16, 2021. After a series of stays, the parties filed a stipulation and order of dismissal, which the Court granted on October 5, 2022. A series of five lawsuits were filed in federal court and one lawsuit was filed in state court by purported Nielsen shareholders against Nielsen and members of our Board of Directors (collectively, the “Actions”) relating to the Transaction. The plaintiffs in three of the Actions filed notices of voluntary dismissal and sent demand letters to Nielsen making substantially the same allegations as were included in the complaints. Five additional demand letters subsequently were sent to Nielsen on behalf of purported Nielsen shareholders, each alleging similar deficiencies in the proxy statement as the Actions. Before the vote on the Transaction, Nielsen filed a supplemental 8-K disclosure addressing the plaintiffs' claims, and the lawsuits were then dismissed. The lone state court action has been settled and fully resolved. Nielsen will now discuss with plaintiffs' attorneys for the remaining claims payment of legal fees to finalize resolution. Based on present information, such payments are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Nielsen’s business, financial position, or results of operations. Nielsen is subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums. Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, the Company does not expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition. However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect the Company’s future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Discontinued Operations,2677.7.1,,"On October 31, 2020, Nielsen entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement to sell its Global Connect business to affiliates of Advent, for $2.7 billion in cash, subject to adjustments based on closing levels of cash, indebtedness, debt-like items and working capital, and the Connect Warrant. On February 11, 2021, Nielsen held a special meeting of Nielsen’s shareholders. At the special meeting, the Connect Transaction was submitted to a vote of the shareholders through the solicitation of proxies. Approval of the Connect Transaction required the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of ordinary shares present (online or by proxy) at the special meeting. The Connect Transaction was approved by the requisite vote of Nielsen’s shareholders. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, Global Connect met the criteria set forth in ASC 205 – 20 “Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations,” and has been presented on a discontinued operations basis for all periods presented. Given the Global Connect segment represented a separate segment and approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues, we considered this to be a strategic shift. The Connect Transaction closed on March 5, 2021. The Company received net proceeds of $2.4 billion on March 5, 2021 and recorded a gain of $489 million net of tax, inclusive of closing adjustments, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Proceeds from the sale were primarily utilized for debt repayment. Prior to final closing adjustments, the Company recorded a gain of $542 million net of tax during the first quarter of 2021. On March 16, 2021, Nielsen completed the partial prepayment of $1.0 billion of the senior secured term loans due 2023 and $0.3 billion of the senior secured term loans due 2025. Nielsen redeemed $150 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% senior notes due 2021 effective March 21, 2021 and redeemed $825 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5.000% senior notes due 2022 effective April 10, 2021, in each case at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In connection with the Connect Transaction, Nielsen and Global Connect entered into a Transition Services Agreement for services that primarily relate to technology functions such as infrastructure and cybersecurity, which continues to run for up to two years following the closing, with an option to extend the term by six months per service. In addition, Nielsen and Global Connect entered into a Master Services Agreement pursuant to which each party granted the other reciprocal licenses to certain data used by Global Connect and Nielsen, respectively, as well as certain corresponding services related to such data at agreed rates for up to five years following the closing. ----- The following table summarizes the major classes of line items constituting net income from discontinued operations, net of tax:",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded in the amount equal to the excess. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset trade name had a carrying value of approximately $1.8 billion. Auditing the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset trade name impairment test involved especially complex and subjective auditor judgment due to the estimation required in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name. The estimate of fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is determined using the “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology included estimated future revenue (including long-term revenue growth rates), royalty rate and discount rate. Specifically, these assumptions can be affected adversely by changes in expectations about future industry, market or economic conditions. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology, including the significant assumptions described above. To test the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company’s use of the discounted cash flow valuation methodology, the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data and the significant assumptions described above. We compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic conditions, the Company’s historical results and other relevant factors. We considered the accuracy of management’s historical projections of revenue compared to actual revenue. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name resulting from changes in the significant assumptions. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the Company’s valuation methodology, discount rate and royalty rate. We have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates and joint ventures where Nielsen has significant influence but not control, usually supported by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. In addition, the Company records changes in the fair value of non-equity method equity investments with readily determinable fair values in net income rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are recognized at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.

Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares of common stock primarily consist of employee stock options and restricted stock. Employee stock options, restricted stock and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common stock outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted stock outstanding includes nonvested restricted stock units and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options which is calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase stock. The effect of 2,342,903, 3,132,528 and 3,950,984 shares of common stock equivalents under stock compensation plans were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as such shares would have been anti-dilutive.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

To minimize credit risk, ongoing credit evaluations of clients’ financial condition are performed. Nielsen is required to measure expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable. Nielsen considered the asset’s contractual life, the risk of loss and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects the risk of loss, even if management believes no loss was incurred as of the measurement date. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company sold $10 million, $249 million and $318 million, respectively, of accounts receivables to third parties and recorded an immaterial loss on the sale to interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.

Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies",2677.36.11,Discontinued Operations,"Nielsen considers an asset to be held for sale when management, having the authority through shareholder and/or Board approval, as needed, commits to a formal plan to actively market the asset for sale at a price reasonable in relation to fair value, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated, the sale of the asset is expected to be completed within one year and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan. Upon designation as held for sale, Nielsen records the carrying value of the asset at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. In accordance with GAAP, assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortized. If the disposal of the component of an entity (or group of components) represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results, it meets the criteria for discontinued operations. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction, are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The expenses included in the results of discontinued operations are the direct operating expenses incurred by the discontinued segment that may be reasonably segregated from the costs of the ongoing operations of the Company. Certain corporate costs directly attributable to the discontinued operations and transaction costs directly related to the sale are also presented within net income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. The assets and liabilities have been accounted for as assets held for sale in Nielsen’s consolidated balance sheets through the date of the sale. The operating results related to these lines of business have been included in discontinued operations in Nielsen’s consolidated statements of operations. The consolidated statement of cash flows presents combined cash flows from continuing operations with cash flows from discontinued operations within each cash flow statement category.

Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies",2677.36.13,,"Nielsen Holdings plc (“Nielsen” or the “Company”) serves the world’s media and content ecosystem and is a global leader in audience measurement, data and analytics. Through its understanding of people and their behaviors across all channels and platforms, Nielsen empowers its clients with independent and actionable intelligence so they can connect and engage with their audiences—now and into the future. Nielsen provides a holistic and objective understanding of the media industry to its various client segments. The Company’s data is used by its publishing clients to understand their audiences, establish the value of their advertising inventory and maximize the value of their content. Its data is used by its marketer and advertiser agency clients to plan and optimize their spend and is used by content creator clients to inform decisions and identify trends. An S&P 500 company, Nielsen has operations in more than 55 countries, with its registered office located in Oxford, the United Kingdom and headquarters located in New York, United States. On August 31, 2015, Nielsen N.V., a Dutch public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, merged with Nielsen Holdings plc, by way of a cross-border merger under the European Cross-Border Merger Directive, with Nielsen Holdings plc being the surviving company (the “Merger”). The Merger effectively changed the place of incorporation of Nielsen’s publicly traded parent holding company from the Netherlands to England and Wales, with no changes made to the business being conducted by Nielsen prior to the Merger. Due to the fact that the Merger was a business combination between entities under common control, the exchange of assets and liabilities were made at carrying value. Therefore, there were no direct accounting implications in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. _Sale of Nielsen’s Global Connect Business_ On March 5, 2021, Nielsen completed the previously announced sale of its Global Connect business (such business, “Global Connect,” and the sale of Global Connect, the “Connect Transaction”) to affiliates of Advent International Corporation (“Purchaser”), pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2020 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Purchaser acquired Global Connect by means of a sale of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries held by Nielsen, which operate Global Connect, for $2.7 billion in cash, subject to adjustments based on closing levels of cash, indebtedness, debt-like items and working capital, and a warrant to purchase equity interests in the company that, following the sale, owns Global Connect (the “Connect Warrant”). The Company received net proceeds of $2.4 billion on March 5, 2021 and recorded a gain of $489 million net of tax, inclusive of closing adjustments, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Proceeds from the sale were primarily utilized for debt repayment. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements– Discontinued Operations. The results of operations of Global Connect have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As such, the results of Global Connect have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Nielsen’s continuing business operates as a single operating and reportable segment. The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All amounts are presented in U.S. Dollars (“$”), except for share and per share data or where expressly stated as being in other currencies, e.g., Euros (“€”).

The provisions of ASC 848 must be applied at a Topic, Subtopic or Industry Subtopic for all transactions other than derivatives, which may be applied at a hedging relationship level. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation.

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, which generally occurs over time. Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable. Revenue is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile audience measurement services and analytics, which are used by the Company’s clients to establish the value of airtime and more effectively schedule and promote their programming and the Company’s advertising clients to plan and optimize their spend. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied and control of the service is transferred to the customer. The Company enters into cooperation arrangements with certain customers, under which the customer provides Nielsen with its data in exchange for Nielsen’s services. Nielsen records these transactions at fair value, which is determined based on the fair value of goods or services received, if reasonably estimable. If not reasonably estimable, the Company considers the fair value of the goods or services surrendered. ----- The table below sets forth the Company’s revenue disaggregated by major product offerings and timing of revenue recognition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

At the inception of a contract, the Company generally expects the period between when it transfers its services to its customers and when the customer pays for such services will be one year or less.

The decrease in the contract liability balance during the period was primarily due to $120 million of revenue recognized during the period that had been included in the December 31, 2020 contract liability balance and the effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by $120 million of advance consideration received or the right to consideration that is unconditional from customers for which revenue was not recognized during the period. _Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations_ As of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.3 billion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) for Nielsen’s services. This amount excludes variable consideration allocated to performance obligations related to sales and usage based royalties on licenses of intellectual property. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 85% of these remaining performance obligations through December 31, 2023, with the balance recognized thereafter. _Deferred Costs_ Incremental direct costs incurred to build the infrastructure to service new contracts are capitalized as a contract cost. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balances of such capitalized costs were $31 million and $3 million, respectively. These costs are typically amortized through cost of revenues over the original contract period beginning when the infrastructure to service new clients ----- is ready for its intended use. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no amortization recorded given that the Company has not yet begun to transfer the goods and services associated with these capitalized costs. There was no impairment loss recorded in any of the periods recorded. _Expected Credit Losses_ Nielsen is required to measure expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable. Nielsen considered the asset’s contractual life, the risk of loss and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects the risk of loss, even if management believes no loss was incurred as of the measurement date.

Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short term leases) and Nielsen recognizes lease expense for these short term leases as incurred over the lease term. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Nielsen’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Nielsen will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Nielsen uses the rate implicit in the lease for the discount rate when determining the present value of lease payments whenever that rate is readily determinable. If the rate is not readily determinable, Nielsen uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is updated periodically, based on the information available at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Nielsen has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for together. Nielsen has operating and finance leases for real estate facilities, servers, computer hardware, and other equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,2677.52.1,Goodwill,"Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names and trademarks, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. Nielsen has designated October 1st as the date in which the annual assessment is performed as this timing corresponds with the development of the Company’s formal budget and business plan review. Nielsen reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of Nielsen’s reporting unit with the respective carrying amount. The Company established, and continues to evaluate, its reporting unit based on its internal reporting structure and defines such reporting unit at its operating segment level or one level below. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis supplemented by a market-based approach. A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections. The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions. Nielsen conducted the annual assessment as of October 1, 2021 and concluded that there was no impairment. Goodwill is stated at historical cost less accumulated impairments losses, if any.

Property, Plant and Equipment",2677.58.1,,"Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Nielsen is required to assess whether the value of our long-lived assets, including the Company’s buildings, improvements, technical and other equipment, have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Nielsen does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist. If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method. The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires Nielsen to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change. During 2020, Nielsen concluded that the decision to exit smaller, underperforming markets and non-core businesses was an impairment indicator for the long-lived assets within those exits. Where the carrying value of the assets exceeded the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, we measured an impairment charge using a discounted cash flow method for estimation of the assets’ fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge associated with property, plant and equipment of $5 million.

In addition, the Company records changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values in net income rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are recognized at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.

Fair Value Measurements,2677.60.2,,"Nielsen’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investments, long-term debt and derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments potentially subject Nielsen to concentrations of credit risk. To minimize the risk of credit loss, these financial instruments are primarily held with acknowledged financial institutions. The carrying value of Nielsen’s financial instruments approximate fair value, except for differences with respect to long-term, fixed and variable-rate debt. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less. In addition, the Company has accounts receivable that are not collateralized. Nielsen services high quality clients dispersed across many geographic areas. The Company analyzes the aging of accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. ----- Investments include investments in affiliates and a trading asset portfolio maintained to generate returns to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. Nielsen assesses declines in the value of individual investments to determine whether such decline is other than temporary and thus the investment is impaired by considering available evidence. No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable and may not be corroborated by market data.",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. Nielsen documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions as well as the hedge effectiveness assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis. Nielsen recognizes all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met, Nielsen recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Nielsen manages exposure to possible defaults on derivative financial instruments by monitoring the concentration of risk that Nielsen has with any individual bank and through the use of minimum credit quality standards for all counterparties. Nielsen does not require collateral or other security in relation to derivative financial instruments. A derivative contract entered into between Nielsen or certain of its subsidiaries and a counterparty that was also a lender under Nielsen’s senior secured credit facilities at the time the derivative contract was entered into is guaranteed under the senior secured credit facilities by Nielsen and certain of its subsidiaries (see Note 12 – Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements for more information). Since it is Nielsen’s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with banks of internationally acknowledged standing, Nielsen considers the counterparty risk to be remote. It is Nielsen’s policy to have an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement established with every bank with which it has entered into any derivative contract. Under each of these ISDA Master Agreements, Nielsen agrees to settle only the net amount of the combined market values of all derivative contracts outstanding with any one counterparty should that ----- counterparty default. Certain of the ISDA Master Agreements contain cross-default provisions pursuant to which the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if the Company either defaults in payment obligations under its credit facility or if such obligations are accelerated by the lenders. At December 31, 2021, Nielsen had no material exposure to potential economic losses due to counterparty credit default risk or cross-default risk on its derivative financial instruments. _Interest Rate Risk_ Nielsen is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on the floating-rate U.S. Dollar loans, and uses floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure. For these derivatives, Nielsen reports the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction. The Company has $1,050 million aggregate notional amount of forward interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2021. These agreements fix the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt. These derivatives have been designated as interest rate cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the following U.S. Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate outstanding interest rate swaps designated as hedges utilized in the management of its interest rate risk:",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits,2677.71.1,,"Nielsen sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans (the “Pension Plans”) and post-retirement medical plans for some if its employees in the U.S. and other international locations. Pension costs, in respect of defined benefit pension plans, primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets. Differences between this expected return and the actual return on these plan assets and actuarial changes are not recognized in the statement of operations, unless the accumulated differences and changes exceed a certain threshold. Nielsen recognizes obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans as expenses in the statement of operations as they are incurred. The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models. In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the assumed rate of compensation increases. Nielsen provides retiree medical benefits to a limited number of participants in the U.S. Therefore, retiree medical care cost trend rates are not a significant driver of our post retirement costs. Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates. Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary. The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. For Nielsen’s U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. For the non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Nielsen believes the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans. The Company uses the spot rate approach to calculate the discount rate for its retirement benefit plans. Under the spot-rate approach, the Company uses individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost within net periodic benefit costs. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Nielsen considers, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components. For Nielsen’s U.S. plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year. The Company assumed that the weighted averages of long-term returns on our pension plans were 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021, 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets. The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption. Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting Nielsen’s expected return on plan assets. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts. During 2019, certain of the Company’s pension plans contracted with insurance companies and transferred $53 million of outstanding defined benefit pension obligations and related pension assets for approximately 125 retirees and beneficiaries in the UK to the insurance companies. The insurance companies are now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to these retirees and beneficiaries. These transactions have no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the covered retirees and beneficiaries. These transactions resulted in a non-cash charge to other income/expense of $6 million in our consolidated statements of operations and did not impact cash flows in 2019. The actuarial gains on the benefit obligation during 2021 were approximately $19 million. This consists of a $20 million gain due to changes in financial assumptions, with the primary driver being an increase in discount rates in most countries. This gain was partially offset by a loss of $1 million related to changes in mortality tables. ----- A summary of the activity for the Pension Plans follows:",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Nielsen’s primary objective with regard to the investment of the Pension Plans’ assets is to ensure that in each individual plan, sufficient funds are available to satisfy future benefit obligations. For this purpose, asset and liability management studies are made periodically at each pension fund. For each of the Pension Plans, an appropriate mix is determined on the basis of the outcome of these studies, taking into account the national rules and regulations. The overall target asset allocation among all plans for 2021 was 53% equity securities and 44% long-term interest-earning investments (debt or fixed income securities), and 3% other investments. Equity securities primarily include investments in U.S. and non U.S. companies. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and mortgage-backed securities. Real estate contracts are categorized as level 3 and are valued based on contractual terms.

Under this plan, Nielsen has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends since 2013. Nielsen paid $86 million in cash dividends during each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. On November 3, 2019, the Board approved a plan to reduce the quarterly cash dividend, with the goal of strengthening our balance sheet and providing added flexibility to invest for growth. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will be subject to the Board’s continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders, and are in compliance with all laws and agreements to which we are subject. On February 10, 2022, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share on Nielsen’s common stock. The dividend is payable on March 17, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2022. On February 26, 2022, Nielsen’s Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company’s ordinary shares. The Board authorization may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulation. This share repurchase authorization replaces all previous authorizations. There were no share repurchases in 2021 or 2020. The timing of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in any Rule 10b5-1 trading, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. This authorization has been executed within the limitations of the authority granted to Nielsen at its annual shareholders meeting held on May 25, 2021 (the ""Authority"") such authority to remain in place until the end of the 2022 annual shareholders meeting, or close of business on August 25, 2022, whichever is earlier. Pursuant to the Authority, the Company may only repurchase ordinary shares in accordance with procedures for ""offmarket"" purchases under the UK Companies Act (the ""Act"") and, in order to be compliant with the Act, share repurchases can only be made pursuant to the terms of one or more share repurchase agreements entered into in either of the forms approved, and with counterparties that have also been approved, by shareholders at the 2021 annual shareholders meeting. Two forms of share repurchase contracts were approved by shareholders. The first provides that the counterparty will purchase shares on the New York Stock Exchange at such prices and in such quantities as the Company may instruct from time to time, subject to the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, as amended. The second form of agreement provides that the amount of shares to be purchased each day, the limit price and the total amount that may be purchased under the agreement will be determined at the time the agreement is executed. Both agreements provide that the counterparty will purchase the ordinary shares as principal and sell any ordinary shares purchased to the Company in record form.

Income Taxes,2677.101.1,,"Nielsen provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,018 million and $1,485 million, respectively, which began to expire in 2021 and begin to expire in 2022 respectively. In addition, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $109 million and $191 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which begin to expire in 2022. In certain jurisdictions, the Company has operating losses and other tax attributes that, due to the uncertainty of achieving sufficient profits to utilize these operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, the Company currently believes it is more likely than not that a portion of these losses will not be realized. Therefore, the Company had a valuation allowance of approximately $494 million and $560 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets related to other temporary differences. With respect to the outside basis differences of “domestic” subsidiaries, in each taxing jurisdiction where a tiered ownership structure exists, the Company has confirmed that one or more viable tax planning strategies exists in each separate taxing jurisdiction that it could, and would - if required - employ to eliminate any income tax liability on such outside basis differences, with the exception of certain Luxembourg entities. The Company is planning to continue operations in Luxembourg, and therefore the Company does not have the ability to avoid potential recapture of the tax benefits claimed for the tax write-down of Nielsen’s ----- investments. As such, Nielsen has established deferred tax liabilities for the outside basis differences related to its investments. In addition, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company no longer asserts that all foreign undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, but rather the Company will, over time, remit up foreign earnings and has provisioned for withholding taxes related to those earnings. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had gross uncertain tax positions of $161 million and $128 million, respectively. The Company has also accrued interest and penalties associated with these unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $7 million and $11 million, respectively. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of benefit/(provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. It is reasonably possible that a reduction in a range of $131 million to $139 million of uncertain tax positions may occur within the next twelve months, and of this amount, approximately $1 million to $9 would result in a tax benefit for income taxes as a result of projected resolutions of worldwide tax disputes, filed tax returns, and expirations of statute of limitations in various jurisdictions, along with related interest and penalties. Furthermore, the amounts ultimately paid may differ from the amounts accrued.

To date, the Company has not been required to perform under such arrangements does not anticipate making any significant payments related to such guarantees and, accordingly, no amounts have been recorded. _Letters of credit_ Letters of credit issued and outstanding amount to $13 million and $18 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Legal Proceedings and Contingencies_ In August 2018, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants Nielsen, former Chief Executive Officer Dwight Mitchell Barns, and former Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson. Another lawsuit, which alleged similar facts but also named other Nielsen officers, was filed in the Northern District of Illinois in September 2018 and transferred to the Southern District of New York in December 2018. The actions were consolidated on April 22, 2019, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi was appointed lead plaintiff for the putative class. The operative complaint was filed on September 27, 2019, and asserts violations of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements relating to the outlook of Nielsen’s Buy segment (now “Global Connect,” which was sold in the first quarter of 2021), Nielsen’s preparedness for changes in global data privacy laws and Nielsen’s reliance on third-party data. Nielsen moved to dismiss the operative complaint on November 26, 2019. On January 4, 2021, certain of the allegations against Nielsen and its officers were dismissed, while others were sustained. On February 3, 2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve this litigation and are currently documenting the terms of that settlement for submission to ----- the Court. Once the formal documents are executed and submitted to the Court, the settlement will be subject to Court approval. The amount of any settlement payment, if approved, is expected to be paid by Nielsen’s insurance carriers. In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of Nielsen’s current and former officers and directors. The derivative lawsuit alleges that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to us in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaint. The derivative lawsuit further alleges that certain officers and directors engaged in trading our stock based on material, nonpublic information. An amended complaint was filed on May 7, 2021, which Nielsen moved to dismiss on July 16, 2021. By agreement dated September 8, 2021, the action was stayed for a period of 90 days. On January 31, 2022, the stay was extended to June 1, 2022. Nielsen intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously. Based on currently available information, Nielsen believes that the Company has meritorious defenses to this action and that its resolution is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Nielsen’s business, financial position, or results of operations. Nielsen is subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums. Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, the Company does not expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition.

Discontinued Operations,2677.119.1,,"On October 31, 2020, Nielsen entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement to sell its Global Connect business to affiliates of Purchaser, for $2.7 billion in cash, subject to adjustments based on closing levels of cash, indebtedness, debt-like items and working capital, and the Connect Warrant. On February 11, 2021, Nielsen held a special meeting of Nielsen’s shareholders. At the special meeting, the Connect Transaction was submitted to a vote of the shareholders through the solicitation of proxies. Approval of the Connect Transaction required the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of ordinary shares present (online or by proxy) at the special meeting. The Connect Transaction was approved by the requisite vote of Nielsen’s shareholders. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, Global Connect met the criteria set forth in ASC 205 – 20 “Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations,” and has been presented on a discontinued operations basis for all periods presented. Given Global Connect represented a separate segment and approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues, we considered this to be a strategic shift. The Connect Transaction closed on March 5, 2021. Nielsen received net proceeds of $2.4 billion on March 5, 2021 and recorded a gain of $489 million net of tax, inclusive of closing adjustments, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Proceeds from the sale were primarily utilized for debt repayment. On March 16, 2021, Nielsen completed the partial prepayment of $1.0 billion of the senior secured term loans due 2023 and $0.3 billion of the senior secured term loans due 2025. Nielsen redeemed $150 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% senior notes due 2021 effective March 21, 2021 and redeemed $825 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5.000% senior notes due 2022 effective April 10, 2021, in each case at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In connection with the Connect Transaction, Nielsen and Global Connect entered into a Transition Services Agreement for services that primarily relate to technology functions such as infrastructure and cybersecurity, which will run for up to two years following the closing, with an option to extend the term by six months per service. In addition, Nielsen and Global Connect entered into a Master Services Agreement pursuant to which each party granted the other reciprocal licenses to certain data used by Global Connect and Nielsen, respectively, as well as certain corresponding services related to such data at agreed rates for up to five years following the closing. ----- The following table summarizes the major classes of line items constituting net income from discontinued operations, net of tax:",N/A,as_expected,2022,389

Nielsen redeemed $150 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% senior notes due 2021 effective March 21, 2021 and redeemed $825 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5.000% senior notes due 2022 effective April 10, 2021, in each case at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. Nielsen wrote-off certain previously deferred financing fees of $7.5 million associated with the redemptions during the period ended March 31, 2021, which was included within net income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The redemption of the 2022 Notes resulted in a pre-tax charge of $1 million in the second quarter of 2021, which was included within other expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations On May 28, 2021, Nielsen Finance LLC and Nielsen Finance Co., each an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Nielsen, issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), and $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2031, (the “2031 Notes”). Nielsen capitalized $19 million of fees in connection with the refinancing. Nielsen applied the net proceeds of the offering plus cash on hand to prepay the approximately $430 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior secured dollar term loans and approximately €530 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior secured euro term loans which were both due 2025 and the approximately €204 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior secured euro term loans due 2023, in each case, at a prepayment price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest. Nielsen wrote-off certain previously deferred financing fees of $20 million in connection with the May 2021 prepayments. In connection with the prepayment of the senior secured dollar and euro term loans due 2025, Nielsen terminated the Credit Agreement dated June 4, 2020, as amended on July 21, 2020, and all commitments thereunder. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Nielsen utilized cash on hand to partially prepay approximately $250 million of senior secured dollar term loans due 2023 at a prepayment price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest. Nielsen wrote-off certain previously deferred financing fees of $0.4 million in connection with the prepayments made during the fourth quarter of 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 interest expense, net, includes zero, $2 million and $6 million, respectively, of interest income in our consolidated statement of operations. The indentures governing the senior notes limit the majority of Nielsen’s subsidiaries’ ability to use assets as security in other transactions and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies subject to certain exceptions. Upon a change in control, Nielsen is required under each indenture to make an offer to redeem all of the Senior Notes issued pursuant to such indenture at a ----- redemption price equal to the 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nielsen, substantially all of the wholly owned material U.S. subsidiaries of Nielsen and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen. _Covenants_ As of December 31, 2021, Nielsen was in full compliance with the financial covenant described below. Nielsen’s Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, date July 21, 2020 (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. and its restricted subsidiaries (which together constitute most of our subsidiaries) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make certain loans and investments, declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness, sell certain assets, transact with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions and alter the business they conduct. These entities are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, in their ability to transfer their net assets to Nielsen. Such restricted net assets amounted to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement contains a total leverage covenant that requires the Covenant Parties (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at or below 5.50 to 1.00, measured at the end of each calendar quarter for the four quarters most recently ended. Neither Nielsen nor TNC B.V. is currently bound by any financial or negative covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. Certain significant financial covenants are described further below. Failure to comply with the financial covenant described above would result in an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement unless waived by certain of our term lenders and our revolving lenders. An event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement can result in the acceleration of Nielsen’s indebtedness under the facilities thereunder, which in turn would result in an event of default and possible acceleration of indebtedness under the agreements governing our debt securities. As Nielsen’s failure to comply with the financial covenant described above can cause the Company to go into default under the agreements governing its indebtedness, management believes that our Amended Credit Agreement and this covenant are material to Nielsen. Pursuant to the terms of Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement, Nielsen is subject to making mandatory prepayments on the term loans outstanding thereunder to the extent in any full calendar year Nielsen generates Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The percentage of ECF that must be applied as a repayment under either the Amended Credit Agreement is a function of several factors, including Nielsen’s ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA, as well other adjustments, including any voluntary term loan repayments and permanent reductions of revolving credit commitments made in the course of the calendar year. To the extent any mandatory repayment is required pursuant to this ECF clause; such payment must generally occur on or around the time of the delivery of the annual consolidated financial statements to the applicable lenders. At December 31, 2021, Nielsen’s ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA was less than 5.00 to 1.00 and therefore no mandatory repayment was required. Nielsen’s next ECF measurement date will occur upon completion of the 2022 results, and although the Company does not expect to be required to issue any mandatory repayments in 2022 or beyond, it is uncertain at this time if any such payments will be required in future periods. _Revolving Credit Facility_ The Amended Credit Agreement contains a senior secured revolving credit facility with aggregate revolving credit commitments of $850 million and a final maturity of July 2023 under which Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings, Inc., and Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. can borrow revolving loans. The revolving credit facility can also be used for letters of credit, guarantees and swingline loans. The senior secured revolving credit facility is provided under the Amended Credit Agreement and so contains covenants and restrictions as noted above with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement. Obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, Nielsen had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $13 million. As of December 31, 2020, Nielsen had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $18 million. As of December 31, 2021, Nielsen had $837 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility. _Debt-Issuance Costs_ The costs related to the issuance of debt are presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt. ----- _Finance Lease and Other Obligations_ Nielsen finances certain computer equipment, software, buildings and automobiles under finance leases and related transactions. These arrangements do not include terms of renewal, purchase options, or escalation clauses. Assets under finance lease are recorded within property, plant and equipment.
