The first annual consolidated financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer will be available in respect of the financial year ending September 30, 2015. The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Senior Notes Issuer’s consolidated financial statements with the financial statements contained in this offering memorandum. Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,” the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair market values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value if the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Since the Acquisition has not been consummated as of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not identified the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities to be assumed at the date of the Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to 12 months from the Completion Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price. Some financial information in this offering memorandum has been rounded and, as a result, the figures shown as totals in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The vast majority of our sales are generated within the selective beauty distribution channel, which requires the formal approval of a supplier to carry a selective product, as opposed to the mass market channel. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate in 19 European countries with over 1,700 stores (including franchised stores) and have e-commerce operations in 15 countries. Since being taken private in the financial year 2012/2013, Douglas has been transformed from a predominantly German diversified retail conglomerate into a leading pan-European selective beauty retailer. Our former non-beauty operating retail businesses were either sold to a third party or transferred to subsidiaries of Seller 1. Substantial operational improvement initiatives have been implemented over the past two years, particularly in the financial year 2013/2014 under a largely new management team, to further enhance our business model and position it for continued profitable growth going forward. In June 2014, we acquired Groupe Nocibé SAS, France, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associated companies (the “Nocibé Group”), a leading beauty retailer in France to further strengthen our market position in France and as the leading specialist retailer of selective beauty and personal care products in Europe.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In Germany, with an estimated market volume of €2.44 billion in 2013, we are the market leader in the selective beauty market in terms of sales, with respect to both stationary and e-commerce business. In France, with an estimated market volume of €3.05 billion in 2013, we established the No.2 position, extending to stationary and e-commerce business alike, through the strategic acquisition of the Nocibé Group, becoming the selective beauty retailer with the largest store network in the country. We also hold leading market positions (top 1-3) in all of our other core markets (which include the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Austria) and believe that we have strong positions in most of our other markets.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Focus on Attractive Market Segment to Benefit from Strong Industry Economics,"We focus on the selective beauty market, an attractive sub-segment of the broader beauty and personal care market. The total selective beauty market in Europe totaled €15.6 billion in 2013 and has shown strong resilience even in a challenging economic environment. In Europe’s two largest economies, Germany and France, which are also our two largest markets and which together accounted for 71% of our pro forma sales in the financial year 2013/2014 after giving effect to our acquisition of the Nocibé Group, the selective beauty market has historically grown at a stronger rate than the larger mass market for beauty and personal care products (comprising beauty and hygiene categories) with respective CAGRs of 5.0% and 1.4% in Germany and respective CAGRs of 3.1% and 1.2% in France in each case for the 2009-2013 period. According to the OC&C Report, in the coming years, the selective beauty market segment is expected to continue to outgrow the mass beauty and personal care market in many European countries. For example, according to the OC&C Report, in Germany, the selective beauty market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% in the 2013-2019 period, which compares to 1.5% for the mass market for beauty and personal care products in the same period, while in France the selective beauty market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.0% for the 2013-2019 period, while the mass market is expected to grow at a CAGR of only 1.2% CAGR in the same period. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

We have a highly attractive and balanced product portfolio, with fragrances contributing more than half, color cosmetics and skin care approximately one fifth each and other products only a small portion to our total consolidated sales in the first half of 2014/2015. Our broad assortment range, which we believe to be one of the largest in the industry, complemented by our service offering, make us a trusted destination for customers of premium beauty care products. We complement our broad assortment range of selective products with attractive exclusive and private label products which allow for differentiation vis-à-vis key competitors and act as an additional margin driver. Thus, we consider exclusive and particularly private label products to be key growth contributors, which, especially in the case of private label, have higher gross margins than third party beauty products.

In our key markets of Germany and France, our stores have nationwide coverage. In Germany, we have an extensive store portfolio of 436 stores (as of March 31, 2015 all stores are directly operated) in prime locations. In France, we have a nationwide store network with approximately twice as many stores as the market leader Sephora.

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,Strong Multi-Channel Operations with E-commerce Leadership Positions Across Key Markets in Europe,"We see ourselves as a leading multi-channel retail trendsetter with high integration of our online and mobile interfaces with our stationary operations (physical stores). We believe that we can provide a highly integrated offering across channels and that we have implemented state-of-the-art cross-channel services and customer relationship management. We consider this a competitive advantage, in particular vis-à-vis pharmacies, drugstores and smaller market participants that do not have the same multi-channel competency. We consider an attractive, easy to use multichannel approach as particularly important in the beauty retail sector since customers increasingly purchase online to save time, money and effort, but at the same time most of them wish to see, feel, smell and test many beauty products in person. Also, store experience and friendly customer advice are parts of a shopping experience which we consider to be difficult to reproduce for a pure-play online retailer. We believe that our e-commerce operations are a key contributor to our growth and in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015 our centrally managed online shops (i.e., our online shops in Germany, France – including, for the first half of 2014/2015, e-commerce sales of €22.4 million from the Nocibé Business –, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland) contributed sales of €229.3 million, or 9.4% of total sales. In Germany, we are the leader in the online market for selective beauty products, with a market share of approximately 51% in the calendar year 2013, based on net e-commerce sales. In France, we held the second position in the online selective beauty segment (approximately 25%, based on 2013 e-commerce sales, aggregated for the Nocibé and the Douglas e-commerce platform, which at the time operated separately). Our French e-commerce activities are now consolidated under the Nocibé brand.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive Strengths,9.2.6,"Proven and Resilient Business Model with a Strong Financial Track Record, Superior Cash Generation and Focus on Expansion","We have shown a strong financial track record for the last three financial years and the first half of 2014/2015 in terms of sales growth, further margin expansion and cash generation. In addition, for our fast growing e-commerce business, we continued implementing operational excellence initiatives, introduced new online service offerings and accelerated the pan-European roll-out of e-commerce operations. As a result of these measures, our sales growth rate has significantly improved in the financial year 2013/2014 and particularly in the first half of 2014/2015. Our like-for-like growth rate increased from 1.6% in the financial year 2013/2014 to 3.9% in the first half of 2014/2015. This was driven both by an improvement of our stationary as well as our e-commerce business like-for-like growth rate, with our ecommerce operations benefitting from strong market momentum and our competitive position in the European online selective beauty market. In the first half of 2014/2015, our sales growth rate was positive across all of our four regional ----- segments, with particularly strong growth in our regional segments of Germany and Eastern Europe (both increasing sales by 5.4% compared to the first half of 2013/2014). Our South-Western Europe segment returned to positive growth following a challenging period, with positive momentum being driven by significant actions undertaken in recent years. Furthermore, since being taken private in the financial year 2012/2013, we have implemented a wide range of efficiency enhancing measures, such as the centralization of functions such as pricing, procurement, category management and assortment planning as well as streamlining of overhead functions and realizing personnel efficiencies across our German and South-Western Europe store portfolios. As a result, on a pro forma basis, our Adjusted EBITDA totaled €256.0 million and our Adjusted EBITDA-margin increased to 10.3% in the financial year 2013/2014. This positive margin trend has accelerated in the first half of 2014/2015, with many of the strategic and operational measures successfully implemented in the financial year 2013/2014 now starting to have positive financial effects in all of our four regional segments. When adjusted to exclude effects from the Nocibé Business, our Adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2014/2015 increased by €27.2 million, or 25.9% as compared to the first half of 2013/2014. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 11.2% for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, representing a margin increase of 0.9%-point over a half year period. In addition, as a result of our continuous efforts to further enhance our operational excellence, we also improved our cash conversion (defined as the difference of Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA, in each case for the respective time period) from 62.9% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 75.0% in the financial year 2012/2013, and 75.6% in the financial year 2013/2014 (all figures on a combined basis).

To this end, we aim to further enhance our store design and introduce a series of activating elements, such as highlight areas to promote innovations or seasonal promotions, to drive customer visit frequency, average ticket sizes and conversion rates, and leverage our new standardized store design to achieve a more homogeneous look and feel across our stores. Another focus lies on enhancing the service experience for our customers along all customer touch points as a key differentiating factor as compared to our competitors. To further improve our operational excellence, we plan to further strengthen best practice sharing across countries and channels.

In particular, it is our strategic goal to reach or further strengthen No.1 or No.2 market positions in all of our core markets in which we operate. To this end, we plan to execute a multi-format expansion strategy, including the ----- continued store roll-out, the implementation of new retail concepts (e.g., shop-in-shop concepts) as well as selected small-scale acquisitions. A particular focus in relation to our intended further expansion is on Germany, France and Poland, where a white spot analysis confirmed strong expansion potential. In addition, we continue to consider selected acquisitions of franchisees, particularly in France. Still, we strive to maintain discipline in our growth strategy and review our store portfolio on an on-going basis. Furthermore, we have identified additional attractive markets where we determined there are promising roll-out and consolidation opportunities either due to market size or market dynamics. This includes the intended expansion of our store network and building of critical scale in Spain, but also further expansion in fast-growing markets such as Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Turkey.

This has been a key driver for the recent margin improvements, but we believe that further upside remains. In Germany, we focus on further transforming our formerly rather decentralized business model into an effective, centrally-steered organization ready for future growth. In France, we aim to leverage on Nocibé’s already highly systematized operating model and, as part of the continued integration effort, bring the store productivity of our former Douglas stores up to Nocibé level. We believe that this focused approach will act as a blueprint for the continuous improvement of operational excellence in all other countries in which we operate in order to realize the significant potential from the migration from a decentralized to a systemized scalable business model.

Also, we intend to grow our sales by introducing new and complimentary product sub-categories beyond the traditional fragrance, color cosmetics and skin care products (e.g., the “Professional Beauty” category which includes inter alia electrical skin cleaning brushes).

The estimates below for the eight months ended May 31, 2014 and 2015 were derived by adding our sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the two months ended May 31, 2014 and 2015, from such internal management accounts, to the sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended March 31, 2014 and 2015 as shown in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. These estimates have been prepared by management and have not been audited, reviewed or verified by our auditors and you should not place undue reliance on them. Our sales for the eight months ended May 31, 2014 do not include the results of the Nocibé Group, which we only acquired with effect from July 1, 2014. To provide an indication of the aggregate of our and the Nocibé Group’s sales for the eight months ended May 31, 2014, we have added sales for the Nocibé Group for this period to our sales for the eight months ended May 31, 2014. This financial data for the Nocibé Group has been derived from the_ _management accounts of the Nocibé Group for the period, which have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, were prepared by the former Nocibé management and have not been audited, reviewed or verified by our auditors. Such aggregate sales number does not represent pro forma financial information and has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards._ Based on preliminary management accounts, we estimate that for the eight months ended on May 31, 2015, our sales, based on our management accounts aggregated with our interim financial statements, increased by approximately 30% compared to sales for the eight months ended May 31, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the growth of our business in France as a result of the first-time inclusion of the Nocibé Group following the Nocibé Acquisition, which became effective July 1, 2014. Compared to the aggregate of our sales and the sales of the Nocibé Group in the eight-month period ended May 31, 2014, our sales for the eight-month period ended May 31, 2015 were 3.5%-3.7% higher. This increase in sales was primarily driven by like-for-like sales growth of our stationary business in Germany and Eastern Europe as well as the growth of our e-commerce sales. We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the eight months ended May 31, 2015 will be approximately 11.7%-11.9%. Our actual results for the eightmonth period ended May 31, 2015 may differ from these preliminary estimates and expectations and remain subject to change.

Data includes in both cases the Nocibé Business for the period from July 1, 2014 until March 31, 2015, as well as, in each case accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 – “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”, the Confectionery Business until April 30, 2014 and the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business until October 1, 2014. The twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015 included the Easter holidays business of the calendar year 2014 as well as the calendar year 2015. 2 Data including the Nocibé Business for the entire period and excluding the Non-Acquired Business (whereby the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business which were accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5—“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” were separated as the first booking entry on October 1, 2014 and were deconsolidated on that date). 3 Data including the Non-Acquired Business (which was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5) and excluding the Nocibé Business (which at the time had not yet been acquired by the Douglas Group). 4 Data including the Nocibé Business as from the effective date for accounting purposes of the Nocibé Acquisition, i.e., from July 1, 2014, to September 30, 2014, and excluding the Non-Acquired Business. 5 Data excluding the Nocibé Business (which at the time had not yet been acquired by the Douglas Group), as well as the Non-Acquired Business. 6 Net sales growth (in %) is defined as the difference between the sales in the period indicated and the sales in the comparable previous period divided by the sales in said comparable previous period. 7 E-commerce sales are defined as the sum of all invoiced sales relating to products and services by customer orders via websites, internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t” sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a mobile or “smart” telephone) and, for Germany, telephone orders after cancellations and backorders, as well as rebates, discounts and returns, disregarding any stock transfer from e-commerce to stationary business. E-commerce sales as shown in this table only relate to those of our online shops which are centrally managed, including our online shops operated in Germany, France (including, for the first half of 2014/2015, e-commerce sales in the amount of €22.4 million from the Nocibé Business), the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland. 8 Like-for-like sales growth (in %) consists of sales growth (excluding the Nocibé Business, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business) from like-forlike stores calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period, and includes e-commerce sales growth, shown as a percentage change. A store is defined as like-for-like when it has been open for at least one entire financial year as of the lock-in date. The lock-in date for the like-for-like stores’ portfolio for the first half of 2014/2015 and 2013/2014, as well as the financial years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012 is the first day of the relevant period. 9 Like-for-like sales growth (stationary) (in %) consists of sales (excluding the Nocibé Business, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business) from like-for-like stores (as defined above) calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period. 10 Like-for-like sales growth (e-commerce) (in %) reflects our e-commerce sales growth, calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period. 11 EBITDA (calculated as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses and plus income from other investments) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA as shown in the table above is unadjusted. 12 Adjusted EBITDA comprises reported EBITDA, adjusted for exceptional items. Exceptional items related to (i) consulting fees, in the financial year 2012/2013 in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, including consulting fees in relation to the squeeze-out in May 2013 and the delisting in August 2013, as well as, in the financial year 2013/2014 in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business and the implementation of certain efficiency measures, (ii) restructuring costs, primarily relating to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and severance payments, (iii) effects from purchase price allocation (“PPA”) related, in the financial year 2013/2014, to the Nocibé Acquisition and (iv) other exceptional items including, in the financial year 2013/2014, one-off inventory revaluations, synergy bonuses for Nocibé’s management, property tax payments related to a corporate restructuring, as well as rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. Exceptional items in the first half of 2014/2015 related to (i) PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, (ii) consulting fees mainly in connection with the Company in sale process and the Nocibé Acquisition as well as consulting fees in connection with the acquisition of Clin d’Oeil and the sales and transfers of the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business effective as of October 1, 2014, (iii) restructuring costs from the recognition of a provision with respect to certain legal disputes and severance payments and (iv) other exceptional items which mainly related to rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. In the first half of 2014/2015, the Austrian Supreme Court found that the taking private of the Douglas Group constituted a change of control within the means of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law (Mietrechtsgesetz) and rejected the argument that the act violates the freedom of establishment (Niederlassungsfreiheit) and the freedom of movement of capital (Kapitalverkehrsfreiheit) under the European Union Treaty. As a result, rent increases in the amount of €1.3 million which were adjusted in the financial year 2013/2014 as extraordinary effects, must be classified from now on as recurring effects and consequently may not be adjusted from the financial year 2014/2015 onwards which has been reflected in our Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define Adjusted EBITDA in the same way, Adjusted EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Credit card fees had historically not been reported in EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA for covenant reporting purposes in connection with financing arrangements. The reclassification excludes the interest portion of credit card fees, which have already been included in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The amount includes €5.2 million of credit card fees from October 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015. (b) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only reflect the results of the Nocibé Group from July 1, 2014, the effective date for accounting purposes of the Nocibé Acquisition. The adjustment represents the French GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of the Nocibé Group for April 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014 in order to show the full effect of the Group Adjusted EBITDA, including the Nocibé Business, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015. (c) Represents the reclassification under IFRS of the adjustment for the accounting of slotting fees received by the Nocibé Group. Under IFRS, slotting fees are shown as a deduction from inventory as opposed to French GAAP where they are credited as income. (d) Run Rate Impacts represent the adjustment required to show the full twelve-month impact of management changes implemented for which the effects are yet to be realized. Such impacts included (i) €4.7 million from mergers and acquisitions, including the acquisition of Clin d’Oeil in February 2015 and five Himmer stores in December 2014, partially offset by the impact of the disposal of certain Clin d’Oeil stores to comply with French and EU competition law, (ii) €5.8 million relating to synergies from the Nocibé Acquisition such as a higher gross margin for Nocibé which benefitted from the Group’s increased purchasing power and other cost saving programs initiated by management, (iii) €2.2 million from personnel restructuring, including as a result of the termination of 270 full-time equivalent employees at our stores and the termination of 97 full-time equivalent employees who ----- performed overhead functions, in each case during the second half of financial year 2013/2014, (iv) information technology and other overhead cost saving programs of €3.4 million and (v) €1.7 million relating to inventory valuation consolidation entries.

Adjusted Sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015 is the sum of sales for the Nocibé Group for the three month period of April 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014 to the consolidated sales of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015 and run rate effects. (6) Capital expenditures relate to additions made to intangible assets (primarily relating to acquired and internally generated software) and property, plant and equipment (mainly regarding the opening and acquisition of new stores and investments in the design and re-design of existing stores). (7) Cash conversion is defined as the difference of Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA, in each case in the period indicated. (8) We define pro forma total senior secured indebtedness as total senior secured indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2015 and includes €1,220.0 million under the Term Loan B Facility, €15.0 million anticipated drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date and €300.0 million represented by the Senior Secured Notes.

(10) We define pro forma interest expense as total interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on April 1, 2014. Pro forma interest expense includes interest on the total pro forma total indebtedness as if such debt (including the €15.0 million drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility) had been outstanding for the entire period. The pro forma interest expense calculation is based on an assumed EURIBOR/LIBOR rate of 1.0% per annum for the Term Loan B Facility and 0.0% per annum for the Revolving Credit Facility for the entire period and includes the commitment fee for the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.

Until the dates of its deconsolidation, the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements still include the Non-Acquired Business. However, in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, the Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5 — “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”. Due to the reclassification of the Non-Acquired Business in accordance with IFRS 5 in the financial year 2013/2014, the comparative figures for the financial year 2012/2013 regarding the income statements and the statements of cash flows (but not the statements of financial position) in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 were adjusted in accordance with IFRS 5 and only include the Non-Acquired Business in a condensed form, whereas, regarding the statements of financial position, they still fully account for the Non-Acquired Business. Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 only include the Nocibé Business for the three-month period from July 1, 2014 until September 30, 2014. The information contained in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial years 2013/2014 and 2012/2013 is not comparable due to the fact that (i) the Company acquired an indirect majority interest in Douglas Holding AG only in December 2012 so that, as a consequence, the consolidated income statements and statements of cash flows for 2012/2013 only accounted for the Douglas Group from December 1, 2012 and not for the entire financial year 2012/2013; (ii) in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, the Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5 (whereby the Confectionery Business was deconsolidated on April 30, 2014), while, in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013 such Non-Acquired Business was fully consolidated; and (iii) we, the Douglas Group, acquired the Nocibé Group in June 2014 leading to significant extraordinary effects to certain line items of our consolidated income statements, statements of financial position and statements of cash flows for 2013/2014.

On June 1, 2015 RoeverBroennerSusat GmbH & Co. KG changed its name to Roever Broenner Susat Mazars GmbH & Co. KG. The Nocibé Consolidated Financial Statements were jointly audited by Groupe Nocibé SAS’s statutory auditors, Constantin Associés (a member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited) and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, who issued an unqualified auditor’s report thereon as included in this offering memorandum. ----- The following summary financial and business information (i) if marked “audited”, is taken either from our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or from our Audited Combined Financial Statements and (ii) if marked “unaudited”, is not taken from our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or our Audited Combined Financial Statements, but rather from either our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Nocibé Consolidated Financial Statements, the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information or accounting records or our management reporting. We have a complex financial history. At the time of the First Douglas Acquisition, the Group consisted of five operating businesses, including the Douglas Perfumeries Business, the Confectionery Business, the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business. Since taking the Group private in the financial year 2012/2013, the Confectionery Business, the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business have been sold and transferred either to a third party or to companies controlled by the Sellers and, thus, have been fully deconsolidated. In addition, with effect for accounting purposes as of July 1, 2014, the Group acquired Groupe Nocibé SAS, a leading perfumeries chain in France (such transaction is herein referred to as the “Nocibé Acquisition”; Group Nocibé SAS, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associated companies, the “Nocibé Group” and the business of the Nocibé Group, the “Nocibé Business”). The tables below present summary selected financial information from our income statements, balance sheets and our statements of cash flows, as well as key performance indicators of the group for the financial year ended September 30, 2012 and for the further periods indicated. The columns in the tables below show, from right to left, the following: - _financial years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013: on a combined basis, only the Douglas Perfumeries Business, excluding the Non-Acquired Business and also excluding the Nocibé Business, which had not yet been part of the Group during these financial years; - _financial year 2013/2014: - regarding data from our income statements, on a combined basis, the Douglas Perfumeries Business, as well as, however only for the period from July 1, 2014 until September 30, 2014, the Nocibé Business (as the Nocibé Business had not been part of the Group prior to this period); - regarding data from our income statements, on a pro forma basis, the Douglas Perfumeries Business, as well as the Nocibé Business (on the hypothetical assumption that the Nocibé Group had been acquired with effect as of October 1, 2013). Therefore, income statement information for the financial year 2013/2014 reflects the hypothetical Douglas Perfumeries Business including the Nocibé Business for the entire financial year. The Non-Acquired Business is only included in the line item “earnings from discontinued operations,” so that all financial information down to “earnings from continued operations” are only reflecting the business in its current structure; and - regarding data from our cash flow statements, on a combined basis, the Douglas Perfumeries Business, as well as, however only for the period from July 1, 2014 until September 30, 2014, the Nocibé Business (as the Nocibé Business had not yet been part of the group prior to this period), and excluding the Non-Acquired Business. The significantly increased net cash flow from investing activities related primarily to the acquisition of the Nocibé Business, with financing of such transaction substantially impacting our net cash flow from financing activities; - _first half of financial year 2013/2014: on a consolidated basis, the Douglas Perfumeries Business, but excluding the Nocibé Business, which had not yet been part of the Group during this period. The NonAcquired Business is included, however, only as discontinued operations; thus, regarding data from our income statements, the Non-Acquired Business is only included in the line item “earnings from discontinued operations;” - _first half of financial year 2014/2015: on a consolidated basis, the Douglas Perfumeries Busienss, as well as the Nocibé Business for the entire period. Whereas the Confectionery Business had already been sold and transferred to a third party and deconsolidated in the course of the financial year 2013/2014, the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business were sold and transferred and, thus, deconsolidated on the first day of this period (as first booking entry on October 1, 2014). Thus, regarding data from our income statements, the line item “earnings from discontinued operations” primarily includes the gains from the sales and transfers of the remaining Non-Acquired Businesses. ----- Regarding data from our cash flow statements, the Non-Acquired Business did not impact any of these positions in the first half of financial year 2014/2015, as the sales and transfers were technically effected through a reduction of shareholder loans, so that there was no cash payment; and - _twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015: regarding data from our income statements, on a consolidated basis, the Douglas Perfumeries Business, as well as, however only for the period from July 1, 2014 until March 31, 2015, the Nocibé Business (as the Nocibé Business had not yet been part of the Group prior to this period). The Non-Acquired Business is only included in the line item “earnings from discontinued operations.” Note that the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015 included the Easter holidays business of the calendar year 2014 as well as 2015. Due to the factors described above, when comparing financial information used in this offering memorandum corresponding to the different sets of financial statements and the different periods, investors should take into account the material differences resulting from the First Douglas Acquisition and the subsequent refinancing, the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business and the Nocibé Acquisition, as well as the resulting changes regarding the composition of the Douglas Group. Because of such effects, the financial information as presented in the different sets of financial statements included in this offering memorandum may not be fully comparable. The Issuers are holding companies formed for the purpose of facilitating the Acquisition and are not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to their formation, the Acquisition and the financing related to the Acquisition. The Issuers’ only material assets and liabilities are currently and are expected in the future to be their interest in the issued and outstanding shares of their respective subsidiaries and their outstanding indebtedness and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Transactions. We do not present in this offering memorandum any financial information or financial statements of the Issuers for the periods presented, other than certain limited financial data presented at the Senior Notes Issuer or Senior Secured Notes Issuer level on a consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect the Transactions. The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum are that of Beauty Holding Zero GmbH and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Audited Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum are that of Douglas Holding AG, an indirect subsidiary of Beauty Holding Zero GmbH, and its subsidiaries.

These economic conditions include levels of employment, inflation or deflation, real disposable income, interest rates, taxation, currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, levels of consumer debt, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions and related willingness or ability to spend, all of which are beyond our control. Since 2008, the macroeconomic environment has been marked by the global financial and economic crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. The crises affected consumer confidence and, accordingly, consumer spending in the European selective beauty market, mainly in Southern Europe and in particular Spain where we had to implement a store closure and restructuring program in response to the negative economic environment of recent years. Future negative economic developments in the global economy, the Eurozone or the countries in which we operate could have an adverse impact on the European selective beauty market in general or in the countries in which we operate and, as a result, consumers may change their purchasing habits and buy more affordable products than those on offer in the selective beauty market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse economic developments may lead to lower overall sales of the products that we offer or require us to change our product mix in ways that impact our overall profitability or result in slower inventory turnover and higher markdowns on inventory. In addition, changes in economic conditions may lead to higher costs associated with our operations, such as longer payment terms for customers, changes to supplier credit terms and the need to restructure or implement cost-saving measures. Any such adverse economic developments could materially negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial position Geopolitical tensions could negatively affect the demand for our products, including current tensions between Western countries and Russia, if they further deteriorate. Furthermore, if the European Monetary Union ceased to exist or one or more countries were to leave the European Monetary Union, the future economic development and consumer spending in general could be adversely affected, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on the European selective beauty market and on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

We may fail to recognize relevant trends or translate market trends into appropriate and saleable products that are competitively priced. Market trends and demand for retail products generally and, in particular, for our beauty and personal care products, are difficult to predict accurately and can change rapidly due to a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including demographics, consumer spending, trends relating to premium and low-cost products or temporary fashion trends. In addition, the success of our business depends on brand and industry perceptions as well as shopping habits of our customers. ----- The internet, including the dissemination of information via social media, is becoming increasingly important and is changing the role of stationary retail. As a result, we are currently re-evaluating our offerings and the way we communicate with our customers. For example, footfall in the stationary retail business has been decreasing in recent years due to changes in shopping behavior. In particular, there has been a diversion of sales from stationary stores due to continuous increases in the proportion of sales through e-commerce channels. If we fail to adapt our offerings and the way we communicate with our customers to meet such trends then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. E-commerce enables consumers to quickly compare different online suppliers and their prices and increases the risk that we may lose sales to other e-commerce retailers. In addition, we may continue to be faced with the relatively high fixed costs relating to the leases of our stationary stores in prime locations, while achieving a lower level of sales from our stationary business due to increased e-commerce purchases by consumers. We may be unable to compensate any such reduced stationary sales with our e-commerce sales. If we misjudge either the demand for the products and services, or our customers’ purchasing habits and preferences, we may be faced with lower sales and excess inventories. As a result, we may be required to increase our promotional activities or mark down the price of unsold inventories and as a result face reduced liquidity levels and higher working capital requirements. Any such failure to anticipate, identify or respond adequately to changing consumer tastes and preferences in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and brand image and our results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and Business,13.1.3,"Our sales, liquidity and inventory levels fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis.","We experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in our sales. Our most important sales period is the six-week period leading to Christmas and over the New Year. Other sales periods that are important to us are those around Valentine’s Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. The uplift in sales around our most important trading periods is often followed by a period of price markdowns. Any decrease in sales during peak selling periods, in particular during the Christmas season, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for a particular financial year. For example, unusually adverse weather conditions, a significant interruption in the supply of products (whether attributable to suppliers, the supply chain or logistics or other product delivery problems), or a sharp decline in consumer traffic in our store network during peak seasons, could materially affect sales during the relevant financial year. Seasonal fluctuations also impact our working capital, liquidity levels and inventory. We incur additional expenses in the preparation for the increased demand we typically expect leading up to, and around, the Christmas season and other peak selling periods and must carry a significant amount of inventory before such periods, which is also reflected in our liquidity (with a certain time lag due to the payment terms that we have agreed with our suppliers). If sales during our peak selling periods are significantly lower than expected, we may be unable to adjust our expenses in a timely manner and may be faced with excess inventory and be forced to rely on higher than usual price markdowns, promotional sales to dispose of excess inventory or inventory write-offs, thus affecting our working capital and liquidity. Higher levels of inventory would also lead to us ordering fewer goods in subsequent periods, which would reduce bargaining leverage with our suppliers. Conversely, if we purchase insufficient quantities of products that sell well during peak selling periods, we may not have an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand and may fail to maximize our sales opportunities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and Business,13.1.4,We face competition in the markets in which we operate and such competition may intensify further.,"We operate in the competitive European beauty and personal care market, and, within this market, we focus on the selective beauty distribution channel. We compete primarily with other specialist retailers with stationary stores or e-commerce activities, including perfumery chains, independent perfumeries, the perfumery departments of selected (typically high-end) department stores, retailers selling products under their own labels, duty-free shops, pharmacies and para-pharmacies (which increasingly focus on skin care and natural cosmetics) as well as drugstores and hypermarkets. In addition, while many of these competitors currently compete with us only in certain segments of the beauty and personal care market, they may extend their offerings to compete with us more broadly in the future. In particular, ----- drugstores, which currently mostly offer mass beauty and personal care products, could increase their range of selective products. Some of our competitors (including online retailers and other direct sellers) have in recent years invested in their product offering and services on a large scale, and may further increase their investment in order to improve their competitive position and market share. Such increased competition could place pressure on our sales, pricing strategy, margins and profitability. Industry consolidation, including by way of mergers and acquisitions, or new competitors that may enter the European beauty and personal care market (and in particular the European selective beauty market) or existing competitors which may expand into other European countries in which they are not yet present but in which we operate, may also lead to increased competition and cause our market position to deteriorate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Such consolidation could also give our competitors increased negotiating leverage with suppliers and greater marketing resources, allowing them to compete more effectively with us. We also face the risk of new competitors offering cheaper imitations of original fragrances or focusing on the entry price sales directed at younger age groups, thus attracting some of our existing or potential customers. For example, until the end of 2013, we had been the leading selective beauty retailer in the Netherlands, when a competitor acquired another participant in the Dutch selective beauty market and thus became the largest player in that country and also engaged in discount pricing to acquire further market share. Some of our competitors’ greater market presence in one or more of the countries in which we operate and strong brands may be perceived by consumers as offering higher quality products and services than we offer or the same quality of products and services at more attractive prices. Certain competitors may also be able to react more swiftly to changes in market conditions or trends or may be able to utilize their market presence, strong brand or other advantages when operating in new or changing markets. They may also be willing to accept lower prices or higher costs than we are prepared to accept in order to win market share. The adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing, intensive promotional activities and markdown strategies, or other similar actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, results of operations and financial position. In certain regional markets, low-cost competitors offering products at discount prices have in recent years gained substantial weight and continue to put pressure on our business. In addition, we face the risk of increased competition from the so-called “grey market,” i.e., the sale of selective beauty products through channels other than the official channels explicitly allowed by the manufacturers. For example, selective products that are sold more cheaply in emerging or developing markets are reimported into established markets at lower prices. These products are typically offered at discounted prices that can be substantially lower than those of the selective distributors and could increasingly undermine the selective distribution channel on which our business model is based. These products can appear first in online/mobile searches for a particular product, for example through online price comparison tools. We also face increased competition from grey market products for our stationary business, in particular in Austria, Spain and Poland and in other countries especially when drugstores and discounters expand their selective offerings and source selective products from the grey market. These types of offerings sometimes also extend to counterfeit products. If we are unable to compete effectively in our marketplace, our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Such brand reputation can be negatively affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include, among other things, unsuccessful or insufficient marketing and merchandising efforts, inability to adequately respond to consumer tastes and preferences or deterioration of the public image or reputation of a brand as a result of unfavorable publicity concerning our Group, the products that we sell or services we provide, our stores, our personnel or other negative publicity. With respect to selective products from third-party brands, which accounted for a vast majority of our sales in the most recent financial year, we are dependent on our suppliers’ investments in marketing and promotion of their brands. ----- Primarily in France under the Nocibé brand, but also in other countries, we have stores that operate through franchisees. The level of control over our franchisees is limited. Our franchisees in France typically have their own purchase processes and contracts with suppliers and, except for some private label and in some cases, exclusive products, we do not typically sell any products to them. Franchisees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our franchisees do not operate according to external or internal standards or do not operate successfully. Disputes with franchisees could also damage our brand reputation and/or our relationships with the broader franchisee group. Furthermore, any breach or perceived breach of relevant laws, regulations, permits or licenses relating to the beauty, cosmetic or other health-related products sold by us, or failure to achieve or maintain particular standards by us or our suppliers (including those of our private label products or any of our franchised stores) could also negatively affect our key brands and affect the reputation of our other products, which could damage our customer relationships and lead to a decline in our sales.

For example, in the financial year 2013/2014, in Germany, we sourced our products (including our exclusive products) from approximately 400 different suppliers, including domestic and international distributors and wholesalers. However, in that financial year, approximately two-thirds of purchasing volume, on a combined basis, related to products sourced from our top ten suppliers, and more than one-third of purchasing volume related to products sourced from our top three suppliers. Our supply chain is susceptible to various risks, including failure by our suppliers to deliver products due to operational or production disruptions, financial problems, labor issues, product quality issues, lack of raw material or other reasons. If one or more suppliers were to fail to deliver the products to us of adequate quality in time or at all, or if we fail to acquire, maintain or strengthen relationships with our suppliers, in particular with respect to selective products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of products may be limited and may become insufficient to meet demand. There can be no assurance that additional or alternative suppliers will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, in such cases, we might need to make changes to our supply chain and enter into other business arrangements in order to ensure supply of quality products in a timely manner, which could result in additional costs and temporary supply shortages or disruptions. Additionally, any resulting prolonged negative impact on the quality of the products or services supplied to us could materially adversely affect our reputation and business. Many of our largest suppliers negotiate their supply terms with us across multiple brands and, in particular in Eastern Europe, local distributors generally negotiate with us on behalf of various manufacturers. Consequently, our supply terms for such brands and products may deteriorate in the future due to the increased bargaining power of such suppliers and distributors. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing suppliers and local distributors, or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional or new suppliers, our ability to source a sufficient amount and variety of products and our ability to obtain such products on terms acceptable to us may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position. We are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure the quality and quantity of the selective products we offer, and we rely on them to provide supplier bonuses, advertising grants and pricing terms that make the offering of their respective brands commercially worthwhile for us, all of which could be negatively affected in case of deterioration or termination of a relationship with a supplier. In addition, we rely on suppliers to provide market development funds (i.e., funds made available by the brand manufacturers to distributors such as Douglas to help sell their products and create local brand awareness). Such market development funds are typically very significant, and a supplier’s decision to discontinue to use our marketing channels, and therefore the withdrawal of such funds, could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Moreover, if we fail to comply with terms of the supply agreements, we could face penalties, potential termination of a contract for cause, or a supplier not renewing our contract at the end of its term. In addition, we cannot eliminate the risk of default by any of our major suppliers under the terms of our agreements with them. Our inability to acquire products on terms and conditions acceptable to us in the future or at all, the loss of any of our largest suppliers or several smaller suppliers, any changes in exclusivity arrangements with one of our key ----- suppliers or delays or a significant disruption to the supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position and a negative impact on our competitive position.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

These suppliers generally also manufacture products for our competitors and their suppliers. Our agreements with the manufacturers of our private label products, which set forth the production and delivery of private label products, are typically based on an order-by-order concept for each private label product or product line rather than long-term supply agreements and may typically be terminated with six-months’ notice. In case an agreement with a private label product manufacturer is terminated, there can be no assurance that we will find other manufacturers that will be able to produce comparable replacement products for us at competitive prices or at all. In addition, we typically do not own the recipes to these products, and it cannot be excluded that the manufacturers may sell the same products to other retailers, which may offer them under a different brand and packaging. If those products were sold by other retailers under a different brand and packaging at a lower price, it could reduce our sales of the relevant products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Since we only have limited control over manufacturers of our private label products, there is no guarantee that these products will continue to meet our specifications. Furthermore, any breach or perceived breach of relevant laws, regulations, permits or licenses relating to the private label products sold by us, or failure to achieve or maintain particular standards could also lead to adverse publicity, which could materially adversely affect the reputation of our private label brands, as well as the “Douglas” and “Nocibé” brands, damage our customer relationships and lead to a decline in our sales. As we are the “responsible person” for our private label products within the context of the applicable European regulations on product safety applicable to cosmetics, any quality defect could lead (on the basis of EU law or similar applicable national laws) to substantial customer claims, administrative or criminal proceedings, penalties or similar. We could also face damage to our own brands’ reputation. In addition, if the manufacturing, delivery, sources or supply chain management processes relating to our private label products are disrupted for a variety of reasons, we may be delayed in restoring our inventory of the affected private label products and we may experience a significant increase in our cost of sales.

We also face the risk that customers find the websites of our online shops difficult to use. Customers may also be unwilling to share personal information online or via our mobile applications, less willing to use the sites than we expect, or not confident that the sites are secure. Furthermore, unexpected costs in connection with the further development of our e-commerce platform and/or our online shops may arise. We may face difficulties in further coordinating our e-commerce platform and our stationary store network, particularly in managing the interface between in-store merchandising and online shopping, which may result in complications for both our e-commerce and crosschannel customers.

Similarly, negative online reviews from ----- dissatisfied customers may deter other potential customers from using our e-commerce platform and may also affect our brands’ reputation and sales in our stationary stores. Besides other (online) measures, we use e-mail to promote our products or marketing messages. The delivery of such e-mails and messages may fail or be delayed for technical reasons, customers may not take note of them or they may be marked as “spam” or “junk.” Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of e-mails or other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements on us in connection with them, could impair our ability to communicate with our customers using e-mail or other means. In addition, certain customers may be dissatisfied when exposed to too many advertising campaigns or newsletters and to what they may consider to be e-mail or text message “flooding.” Our failure to respond appropriately to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our sales (in particular our ecommerce sales) as well as damage our reputation and brands, especially since e-commerce is a significant part of our growth strategy.

For example, our online and mobile offerings must keep pace with the technological development of the devices used by our customers, the technological progress of our competitors and any consequential new shopping behaviors and trends. Recently, specialized online or mobile applications relating to beauty in general and beauty products in particular have increased significantly, contributing to substantial changes in shopping behavior and the use of distribution channels by customers. Furthermore, our success, in particular with respect to our e-commerce sales, depends on our ability to continuously improve our technological platform and to develop new applications in line with the technological development and trends in order to remain competitive. For example, the introduction of new payment solutions may entail substantial costs and effort and there is no guarantee that such new solutions will be accepted by customers, which may result in frustrated expenses. We may fail to adopt and apply new technological advances in a timely manner, or experience difficulties or compatibility issues.

We use various tools, such as marketing events, online advertising, visual merchandizing, social media and in-store events to support the positioning of our brand, acquire new customers, increase the number of customer visits to our websites, the number of orders and the purchase size per order. We have made significant investments in brand awareness and enhancement, customer acquisition and customer loyalty which may prove ineffective.

However, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or at the envisaged pace if we fail to identify and lease attractive store locations on acceptable terms, attract and hire skilled sales staff or implement the required infrastructure. We may also face difficulties in obtaining adequate financing to fund expansion. Consequently, the intended increase of our stationary market share may fail to materialize. The success of new stores may also be affected by our failure to correctly estimate customer demand for stationary store sales. In addition, the opening of additional franchised stores depends, in part, upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria. If we fail to add new stores to our network, this could adversely affect our ability to increase our sales. In addition, part of our strategy is to grow by entering new geographical markets. For instance, most recently, in October 2014, we opened our first store in Norway through a joint multi-channel franchise co-operation. Entering a new geographical market requires substantial investments and may not lead to the desired results, or occur at the desired pace. Our success in pursuing this strategy will be dependent on various factors including our understanding of the target market, our ability to position ourselves within such new markets, as well as our ability to offer products adapted to local preferences on competitive terms. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully penetrate and operate in any new markets on a sustainable and profitable basis. Factors that may negatively influence the planned expansion and result in higher-than-expected costs or delays include, in particular, political or economic instability, difficulties in finding reliable local partners and in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled staff, difficulties in prevailing over local competition and in generating a sufficient level of sales, difficulties related to labor relations or compliance issues, as well as any imposition of restrictions on import, investment or currency, such as tariffs and import quotas on the repatriation of earnings and capital, and greater-than-expected competition. Furthermore, entering a new market entails operational complexities and risks, such as adapting the product offerings as well as our logistics, payment, fulfillment and customer care practices to take account of local tastes and practices and the operation of country-specific online shops. If we fail to manage these challenges adequately or if any of these risks materialize, the significant investments made may not be recovered and substantial losses may occur. Moreover, we have explored different product offerings beyond our core beauty focus and we plan to continue to develop selected non-core product offerings in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding into areas beyond our core beauty portfolio, that any new product categories will perform as expected, and that the investments incurred in connection with such expansion will be recovered. In addition, our existing or new competitors may also target these segments and may be able to pre-empt some of our expansion plans. Furthermore, our plans to grow our business, among others, through the growth of products sold under our own brands, may result in our taking greater risks on holding stock. If we are left with excess inventory of our private label products, due to such products’ failure to meet customers’ tastes or preferences or for other reasons, we may not be able to make arrangements with the suppliers of these products to dispose of the excess stock or offset all or part of the costs incurred. Our selected expansion into service offerings may not be successful due to its substantially different business model, financial parameters and margins. In addition, customers may not accept us as a legitimate point of service. For example, in the past, we installed hair dressing and beauty cabins across a number of stores, testing different store concepts in selected locations. However, many of them were closed down since they did not achieve the expected demand. ----- Given the various challenges to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, there can be no assurance that our expansion strategy can be successfully implemented.

Such integration may be a complex, time consuming and expensive process and will likely involve a number of uncertainties. These include the costs and expenses associated with unexpected difficulties, the diversion of management’s attention from our daily operations and/or strategic business decisions, the potential loss of key employees, difficulties in competing with existing stores or business or diverting sales from existing stores or business, difficulties in complying with foreign regulatory requirements and the additional demands on management related to the increase in the size and scope of our operations following an acquisition. For example, our acquisition of Groupe Nocibé SAS, France, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associated companies (the “Nocibé Group”) in June 2014 was only approved by the antitrust authorities subject to certain conditions, in particular requiring us to sell certain stores in France. This process is currently on-going. We aim at primarily divesting franchised stores, in order to meet the conditions, however, we have and may need to continue to dispose of certain directly operated stores, which would have a more substantial adverse impact on our profitability than the termination of franchises (which would mostly result in the loss of the respective royalties only). Due to our already large footprint and the concentration of the selective beauty market in Europe, it may become increasingly difficult to meet the requirements of antitrust and competition regulation when pursuing acquisition targets. Even if we are able to successfully integrate newly-acquired businesses, this integration may not result in the realization of the full synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, operational efficiencies and other benefits that we expect. Furthermore, changes in brand name in the context of an integration following a major acquisition, such as the shift from our “Douglas” stores and online shop in France to “Nocibé” are associated with additional costs and the risk of a potential loss of business and reputation. The realization of any of these risks in connection with past and future acquisitions and joint ventures may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, profitability and growth, and thus on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Sub-lease agreements are in place between Douglas as sub-lessor and the respective Thalia, Appelrath, Christ or Hussel companies operating the respective store as sub-lessee. Such sub-lease agreements mirror to the largest extent possible the terms of the external Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreements. Douglas has further issued, in its capacity as former parent company of the Non-Acquired Business, certain letters of comfort and guarantees in favor of lessors under certain lease agreements entered into by Thalia, Appelrath, Christ and Hussel companies as lessee (“DHAG Parent Securities”). As of March 31, 2015, the present value of the basic rental charge for the Non-Acquired Business was €100.6 million and the aggregate amount of the DHAG Parent Securities was €17.4 million. The agreements relating to the disposal of the Non-Acquired Businesses provide that the parties thereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an assumption of the Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreements by the relevant Non-Acquired Business and to obtain any required consent of the relevant lessors and that the respective purchaser is obliged to indemnify Douglas and all of its affiliates from any and all claims, losses, costs, fees, charges or damages resulting from or arising in connection with the Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreements or the DHAG Parent Securities. In addition, the Sellers are obliged to indemnify the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement from such obligations if they cannot be collected under the respective disposal agreements. This indemnity is subject to certain limitations and risks as described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions.” While Douglas has been able to achieve a transfer of Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreements to Non-Acquired Businesses with full release for Douglas in a number of cases and reached agreement on such transfer in many other cases, not all lessors have granted or will grant the required consent for such transfer and release and Douglas will therefore remain responsible for fulfillment of the obligations under the Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreements concerned. If and to the extent the relevant Thalia, Appelrath, Christ and Hussel companies no longer perform (or are no longer able to perform) their obligations under the corresponding sub-lease agreements, Douglas may not be able to sub-lease the premises concerned to third parties at the same economic terms as applicable under the Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreement concerned, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, Douglas has incurred or will incur certain payment obligations to lessors as compensation for the transfer of Non-Acquired Business Lease Agreements to Non-Acquired Businesses or has granted or will have to grant certain guarantees in favor of lessors in connection with such transfer. For the Non-Acquired Business, Douglas was and continues to be a party to transitional services agreements between Group companies and the divested companies. In particular, Douglas provides certain transitional services to the divested companies relating to information technology and real estate-related services, including the management of leases, facility management, and co-ordination of store renovation, etc. Douglas intends to gradually reduce the extent of these services and to achieve a phase-out within the next few years. If and to the extent the divested companies no longer perform (or are no longer able to perform) their obligations (in particular their payment obligations) under these transitional services agreements, Douglas will have the risk of suffering a shortfall in revenues which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In 2014, we sold the Non-Acquired Business, which led to the current structure of our Group. As a result of the reorganization, we now focus on our perfumery business. We have also recently undergone internal restructurings and reorganizations in the recent past. We may carry out further reorganization measures from time to time. Such measures entail costs, may divert management’s attention from our daily business and/or strategic business decisions, and may otherwise be disruptive to our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that such reorganization measures may lead to the expected efficiency improvements or cost savings, or be completed within the planned timeframe.

We also operate online shops in 15 countries, including several stores that were launched during the past few years, and we also plan to launch additional online shops in the near future. We cannot guarantee that opening or acquiring additional stationary stores or the launch of new online shops will not adversely affect our existing stores’ operations or that our strategy of adding new stores to our network will be profitable. ----- Our operating complexity will increase as we implement our growth strategy and will require a continuous expansion and improvement of our operating capabilities and the training and management of a growing employee base. Developing and refining the appropriate internal management, accounting and book-keeping processes, organizational compliance and risk monitoring structures required for this growth and the increasingly complex group structure places high demands on us and our management, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure, with no assurance that sales and profitability will increase accordingly. As our operations grow further, we will need to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to deal with the greater scale and complexity of operations. Delays in improving these systems and in reaching an appropriate level of staffing may result in business and administrative oversights and errors, which may also lead to higher operating expenses. In addition, our growth could make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make in the future. This growth could also impact the operational flexibility of the supply chain organization and impair our ability to react promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends. If we do not make the necessary capital or other expenditures to accommodate our future growth, we may not be successful in our growth strategy. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers and to develop and improve our internal controls. We may be unable to accurately anticipate all the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel, systems and controls and procedures, and the failure to appropriately address such demands, or the realization of any of the above-mentioned risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

If we are not able to secure attractive sites for new stores on acceptable terms, our further expansion would be significantly impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, new stores from other retailers or from our Group in the proximity of our existing stores could compete with our existing stores for customers. Our commercial leases typically provide for an adjustment of the rent due to changes in certain public indices. Such adjustments are intended to counteract inflation risks of long-term contracts. If the relevant indices increase at a higher rate compared to past performances, or if there are adverse changes in terms of calculations relating to such indices, rents linked to these indices will be adjusted at higher levels which could increase our expenses and have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operation which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

Our stationary stores are typically located in prominent locations within shopping centers and town centers. Our sales at these stores are dependent, to a significant extent, on the volume of customer traffic in such retail destinations and the surrounding areas. This in turn benefits and is dependent on the ability of other retailers in those destinations to generate customer traffic in the vicinity of such stores. Our sales may, thus, be adversely affected by a decrease in popularity of the retail destinations or anchor stores in the vicinity of our stores, the closing of anchor stores or a deterioration in the financial position of retail destination operators or developers that could, for example, limit their ability to finance tenant improvements for us and other retailers. Store closures by other retailers and vacancies in shopping centers and other retail destinations may also decrease footfall. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative store leases in prime locations on commercially acceptable terms. Moreover, properties currently considered prime locations may deteriorate and become less desirable in the future. ----- The decrease in footfall as a result of these or other factors constitutes a major challenge for the like-for-like growth of our stationary business.

Our cost structure may be negatively affected by cost increases, in particular those relating to rental, electricity and personnel costs, as well as transportation and logistics costs, among others. In particular with respect to transportation costs, we have experienced such costs increases in a significant manner in recent financial years. In addition, failure to control the amount and quality of our significant inventory stock could reduce profitability and increase losses. For example, constraints in our inventory management systems and/or processes may cause excess inventory in one location and insufficient inventory in another. Conversely, failure to order enough stock or problems in the delivery and distribution of stock could result in unfilled orders and missed sales opportunities. If we are unable to continue to achieve these economies of scale and cost efficiencies due to fluctuations in our operating costs or for other reasons, this could also have a negative impact on our results of operations.

The demands on logistics have continued to rise, especially with the growing e-commerce business and the increasing interlinking of stationary stores and e-commerce platforms. We run some of our inbound and outbound logistic processes in-house, dealing with logistics from our warehouses to our stores, and also co-operate with a few logistic partners who, for example, run our e-commerce distribution center in Germany, our cross-docking center in Italy, Poland and the Netherlands, and ship our products to our stores and directly to our e-commerce customers. In some of our regional markets, it may be difficult to replace our current logistics providers due to a lack of alternative offerings at comparable prices and/or service quality and we may face higher costs when an existing logistics contract is renewed or replaced. Furthermore, all but one of our main warehouses are leased or operated by third party warehouse service providers, and most of the relevant leases and service agreements will expire within the next two years. If we are unable to renew the respective leases or services agreements, it may be difficult for us to lease suitable alternative locations on favorable terms, and any new leases may involve changes to our logistics organization as well as increases in lease payments and other costs. Any disruption to our relationship with any external transporters, major logistic partners or brand manufacturers/brand suppliers with respect to logistic costs or similar could also adversely affect our business or result in increased shipping costs, which could negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, the delivery of the products that we sell (both the delivery to our stationary store network as well as to customers who purchased the products via our e-commerce platform) could be delayed or fail due to technical problems, strikes or force majeure, including adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, any major operational disruptions or accidents in our warehouses and centers, and any breakdowns or disruptions of the operations of our suppliers, might significantly impact our ability to distribute products and maintain an adequate product supply chain and in-store inventory.

We also depend on our IT systems to be able to effectively manage our customer relationships. With technological advances, greater networking and an increasing integration of business processes, the need for the permanent availability of our IT systems has become even more critical. Management uses certain IT-based demand-forecast tools and other IT systems to support decision making and to monitor business performance. In case of a system disruption, including any difficulties during roll-outs, we may fail to generate accurate and complete financial and operational reports essential for making decisions at various levels of management, which could lead to less-informed decisions being made.

The intangible assets mainly consisted of goodwill, the “Douglas” brand, the “Nocibé” brand and certain leasehold interests and similar rights. The carrying value of our intangible assets may increase further as a result of the purchase price allocation following the completion of the Acquisition. We determine the value of the intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting principles and distinguish between amortizable intangible assets, such as goodwill, and non-amortizable assets, such as leasehold rights. With respect to intangible assets that are not amortized, an impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on which the current carrying amount are based are not fulfilled and the recoverable amount of any cash generating unit is less than the Group’s carrying amount, such as if market and industry conditions deteriorate or interest rates rise. In performing impairment tests of assets, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, including our main brands, management considers several assumptions and carries out analyses that are based on projections and judgments. Economic downturns, including deteriorating economic conditions in the industries and regional markets in which we operate, as well as legal, regulatory, competitive, contractual and other factors may affect these assumptions and therefore the value of our assets. Recognition of an impairment charge would reduce our reported assets and earnings.

If these regulations were to change or were violated, for example, by our management, employees or franchisees, by the manufacturers of the products we sell or by our suppliers, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for the products that we sell and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the sale, distribution and marketing of certain products that we sell, in particular, cosmetic products, are highly regulated. For example, with respect to certain of our private label products, certain subsidiaries of our Group act as responsible persons for purposes of the European Cosmetic Products Regulation and may be subject to liability under this regulation. Furthermore, and irrespective of our designation as responsible persons within the meaning of the European Cosmetic Products Regulation, as a retailer we are subject to regulations regarding product safety and product liability under which we are obliged, inter alia, to monitor that the products we offer comply with general safety requirements and must adopt the necessary measures to avoid any safety threats, for example, by ----- withdrawing unsafe products from the market, informing customers and recalling products that have already been supplied to customers to avoid being exposed to the risks of liability. For example, in this context, we faced a quality issue in June 2014, when independent testers discovered contaminated/toxic particles in certain “world cup fan” make-up products leading to the subsequent recall of these products and their removal from our stores. With regard to IT and e-commerce activities, frequent changes in both the legal and the technological developments increase the risk of non-compliance with legal demands, which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Failure to comply with any relevant rules and regulations may result in licenses or authorizations required in connection with the relevant business areas being withdrawn or not being granted in the future, or may subject us to significant penalties or claims, and in some cases may even constitute a punishable offence, and significantly affect our ability to conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Legal requirements are frequently changing and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our employees or franchisees may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are indirectly affected by changes in the laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies with which suppliers of our products, in particular the manufacturers of our private label products, must comply. For example, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our suppliers’ products and our private label products are subject to extensive consumer laws and regulations in different jurisdictions, which may change or develop over time in a way that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

A failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to us becoming subject to penalties or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The need to comply with data protection legislation is a significant controlling, operational and reputational risk which can affect us in a number of ways including, for example, making it more difficult to maintain and expand our marketing data and also through potential litigation relating to the alleged misuse of personal data. Regulation regarding data collection and data protection may also become more strict in the future. New laws, regulations or developments in this field and changes in consumer behavior could interfere with our strategies to use privacy-related information for our multi-channel marketing efforts and could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Significant modifications in laws or regulations in countries in which we operate may consequently lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices. Also, compliance will become more complex and involve higher costs and the increasing risk of noncompliance may give rise to civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges. For example, a proposed new regulation on data privacy issued by the European Commission in January 2012 (the “General Data Protection Regulation”) would introduce substantial changes to the EU data protection regime, involving replacement of the current national data protection laws by a directly applicable EU regulation. If the draft regulation were to become law in its current form, it would impose a substantially higher compliance burden on our business. In addition the regulation would foresee higher maximum level of fines than is currently the case for potential compliance failures. The proposed EU regulation continues to progress through the legislative process and it is not currently possible to assess its full potential impact. We are exposed to the risk that our data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed in breach of data protection regulation, by us or on our behalf. If we or any third party service providers on which we may rely fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, or if any such loss of personal customer data were ----- otherwise to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws.

In connection with the acquisition of the Nocibé Group, the antitrust authorities approved the sale subject to certain remedies, in particular requiring us to sell certain stores in France, which process is currently on-going. We may still be subject to further investigation by competition authorities in the future in relation to these remedies related to the Nocibé Acquisition. In addition, in February 2015 we acquired 43 franchise stores from Clin d’Oeil of which we are required to dispose of seven due to antitrust conditions relating to the acquisition. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the introduction of new antitrust or competition laws in the jurisdictions that are relevant to our operations or the interpretation or enforcement of existing competition laws will not affect our business and operations in the future or will not restrain us from making future acquisition or expanding our business, in the event we wish to do so in the future. Furthermore, the use of selective distribution contracts, i.e., contracts that require formal approval of the supplier for the product to be listed, effectively restricts competition by limiting the sale of fragrance products almost exclusively to selective distribution channel retailers, is critical to our current business model. Selective distribution currently benefits from a specific legal framework provided by EU Regulation (No. 330/2010 (EC)). This regulation provides for an exemption from the prohibition of anti-competitive restrictions for selective distribution agreements, i.e., agreements pursuant to which a supplier undertakes to sell only to distributors selected on the basis of specific qualitative and quantitative criteria. On the basis of EU Regulation No. 330/2010, selective distribution agreements are exempted as long as, in particular, the market share of both the supplier and the buyer does not exceed 30% and these agreements do not contain “hard core” restrictions of competition (e.g., resale price maintenance or restrictions of active or passive sales to end-users by the members of the selective distribution network). See “Business—Regulatory Environment.” However, following changes in the applicable laws, regulations, case law or the application thereof by competition authorities, other distribution channels may begin selling products (or increasingly sell products) that currently generate the majority of our sales and this may lead to a significant increase in competition, potentially requiring us to cut our profit margins in order to remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

For example, even if we strive to limit the risk of warranty claims for product defects or from product liability claims by including recourse clauses in our agreements with suppliers and with the manufacturers of our private label products, we may be exposed to such claims and, in the event that the supplier is financially unable to respond for the damage or should our insurance not cover the claims asserted against us adequately or at all, we may have to bear the costs related to the product liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Any such proceedings, even if we are successful, could divert management resources, incur certain expenses and cause damage to our reputation. The involvement in any such litigation, administrative and arbitration proceedings as well as the outcome of such litigation and proceedings, which cannot be predicted and may not be in accordance with our assessments, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We are currently subject to several pending litigation proceedings including in connection with the adequacy of compensation to minority shareholders in relation to a squeeze-out of the minority shareholders in the Douglas Group, which became effective in July 2013, and proceedings relating to the Nocibé Group’s alleged involvement in concerted practices in the determination of resale prices among fine perfume suppliers and retailers in the late 1990s. In addition, ----- we are currently involved in litigation with a supplier, Passion Beauté, France, in relation to alleged acts of wrongful termination and breach of contract of our supply agreement with Passion Beauté. As of March 31, 2015, we have reserved €1.5 million in relation to this dispute. We are also subject to legal proceedings against several Austrian landlords who claimed increased rent as a consequence of the alleged triggering of change of control provisions due to an indirect change of control in Douglas Austria when the Group was taken private in December 2012. Douglas Austria has objected to all of the requested rent increases and has paid the increased rent amounts on a conditional basis (with the exception of one instance where only the original rent has been paid and, as of March 31, 2015, a provision of €945,000 has been made for a potential retroactive rent increase). We have reached out-of-court settlements with two of the landlords while five other cases are currently pending in Austrian courts and in one case we are currently involved in out-of-court negotiations. For more detail on ongoing litigation proceedings, see “Business—Material Legal Disputes _and Administrative Proceedings.”_ In addition, the Acquisition may entitle certain Austrian landlords to claim increased rents.

Therefore, our commercial success depends on our and our suppliers’ ability to successfully defend our and their intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, customer lists and domain names, including the ability of franchised stores to operate in a manner consistent with our required standards and guidelines in this area. In particular, we own a large portfolio of trademarks, including word trademarks and word/device trademarks used by companies in our Group and by franchisees, domain names, and some design rights. In particular, the trademarks that protect the designation “Douglas” as well as the trademark “Nocibé” are important to us. Furthermore, we use some smaller local (sub-)brands or company symbols to differentiate our offering and address different target groups, for example, Schnitzler (targeting luxury, high-end customers in Düsseldorf, Germany), HELA (targeting more price-sensitive customers mainly in Munich, Germany) and Les Bellista by Nocibé (targeting trendy, younger customers in France and more recently in Germany). With respect to several of the registered trademarks, we have entered into coexistence agreements and prior rights agreements for specific countries or situations. Regarding domain names, in particular “douglas.de”, and the top-level domains for other countries, in particular those in which we operate an online shop, play an important role in our business operations. We do not own the recipes or intellectual property rights relating to our private label products, which are manufactured by third parties. We expect to continue to file further trademark applications seeking to protect selected newly-developed brands or products, or apply for registration of existing brands or products in other relevant jurisdictions, but cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued. There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to renew a trademark (or design or domain) on a timely basis or fail to pursue our brand monitoring. Moreover there is the risk that our competitors may challenge, invalidate, dilute or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, even though a trademark has been duly registered, under local regulation the fact that a trademark is not used for a certain period of time (such as five years in the European Union) may render the trademark registration voidable. Moreover, earlier rights (such as a pre-existing right to a name, copyrights and other industrial property rights) may prevail over the registration of the trademark. With respect to domain names, these are generally regulated by internet regulatory bodies and may also be subject to trademark laws and other related laws of each country. If we do not have or cannot obtain or maintain on reasonable terms the ability to use our “Douglas” or “Nocibé” trademarks, or any other significant brand in a particular country, or to use or register “Douglas” for a certain domain name, we could be forced either to incur significant additional expenses to market our products within that country, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials and packaging, or to elect not to sell products in that country. Furthermore, the regulations governing domain names and laws protecting marks and similar proprietary rights could change in ways that block or interfere with our ability to use relevant domains or our current brands. In addition, we may not be able to prevent third parties from registering, using or retaining domain names that interfere with our customer communications or infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks, domain names and other proprietary rights. Regulatory bodies may establish additional generic or country-code top-level domains or may allow modifications of the requirements for registering, holding or using domain ----- names. As a result, we may not be able to register, use or maintain the domain names that utilize the name “Douglas” (or “Nocibé”, currently for France) in all of the countries in which we currently conduct business or intend to conduct business in the future. Furthermore, there can be no assurance we will be able to adequately or sufficiently prevent infringement or misappropriation of our portfolio of intellectual property by third parties.

In this context we use standardized documents, standard-form contracts and standardized terms and conditions. If such documents, contracts or terms and conditions turn out to contain provisions that are disadvantageous to us, or if clauses in such documents or contracts are declared invalid and thus displaced by statutory provisions which are unfavorable to us, a large number of standardized documents, contracts or terms and conditions could be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Additionally, standardized contractual terms under German law (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen) have to comply with the statutory law on general terms and conditions, which means they are subject to rigid fairness controls by the courts regarding their content and the way they, or legal concepts described therein, are presented to the other contractual party by the person using them. The standard is even stricter if they are used vis-à-vis consumers, which is the case of the vast majority of our customers. As a general rule, standardized terms are invalid if they are not transparent, clearly worded, or if they are unbalanced or discriminate against the other party inappropriately. Due to the frequent changes to the legal framework, particularly with regard to court decisions relating to general terms and conditions, we cannot fully protect ourselves against risks arising from the use of such standardized contractual terms. Even if documents, contracts and terms and conditions are prepared with legal advice, it is not impossible to avoid all potential risks from the outset or in the future, as the changes may continue to occur in the legal framework, particularly through case law.

This may be due to an interpretation or view of laws and/or facts by tax authorities in a manner deviating from our view. ----- Due to our international focus, we are exposed to tax risks, in particular with regard to transfer pricing rules that apply in several jurisdictions and, in relation to cross border business relationships. Pursuant to such rules, related enterprises are obligated to conduct any inter-company transactions on conditions which would also apply among unrelated third parties concluding comparable agreements (so-called “at arm’s length principle”) and to provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to the rules applicable to them in the relevant jurisdiction. The possibility that the tax authorities will challenge our compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, transfer pricing risks may increase in the future as intra-group cross-border business grows, in particular relating to our increasing sales of private label products. Furthermore, changes to the Competitiveness and Employment Tax Credit in France (Credit d’impôt compétitivité et emploi, or “CICE”), including changes in the conditions or requirements thereunder or the accounting of tax treatment thereunder, may result in the decrease or elimination of the expected positive impact of the CICE on our results of operations. The Company as well as the German and other foreign subsidiaries within the Douglas Group are subject to tax audits by the respective tax authorities on a regular basis. The most recent tax audits of the German companies of the Douglas Group comprised the financial years from 2005/2006 to 2008/2009 and were completed in December 2012. No material Nocibé entity has been subject to a tax audit recently. However, Nocibé France Distribution, a subsidiary of Nocibé, is currently subject to a tax audit (started in November 2014) covering the financial years ended on December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. With regard to the French Douglas entities, Parfumerie Douglas France was subject to a tax audit in 2011 covering all taxes for the financial years starting on October 1, 2007 and ending on September 30, 2010 and in 2013, Douglas Expansion was subject to a tax audit covering all taxes for the period starting on October 1, 2010 and ending on September 30, 2012. Our Spanish subsidiaries were subject to a tax audit covering all taxes for the financial years starting on October 1, 2008 and ending on September 30, 2010. With respect to the tax audit of our Spanish subsidiaries, the Spanish tax authorities initially fixed additional taxes to be paid and penalties in the amount of €6.3 million and €5.2 million for the financial years ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2010, respectively. We have successfully appealed these assessments with only reduced penalties in the aggregate amount of €2.8 million being upheld. We have again appealed against these reduced assessments and have reserved €0.3 million for potential success fees for the tax advisors. However, there is the risk, that the findings will be upheld or even increased. As a result of current or future tax audits or other reviews by the tax authorities, additional taxes (including withholding taxes, real estate transfer tax, capital duty and stamp duty) could be assessed on companies of the Douglas Group or tax losses carried forward as well as interest expenses carried forward for purposes of the German interest stripping rules could be reduced, which could lead to an increase in our tax obligations and thus have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Our corporate structure has been, and may be in the future, subject to reorganization measures (for example, transfer of subsidiaries, carve-outs or mergers). We may not be aware of a certain tax issue or that the tax authorities will question some or all of the positions that we have taken and, consequently, additional taxes may be assessed or tax assets be challenged. Furthermore, due to our international operations, we are exposed to risks arising from the application of international tax concepts used for the purpose of allocating taxing rights between countries, for example the concept of permanent establishment as used, inter alia, in OECD model treaties. In particular, our business activities outside Germany might inadvertently trigger taxing rights of foreign countries (e.g., due to a representative’s permanent establishment), leading to additional tax burdens for us. VAT rates could increase in the future in the countries in which we operate. If we do not increase the prices of the products that we sell to match the increase in VAT, our profitability margins will be negatively impacted. If we pass the increase in VAT on to our customers by raising the prices of the products that we sell, the demand for such products may decline, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. The announcement of a future decrease in VAT rates may also adversely affect our results as customers could delay making purchases until the decrease in VAT has occurred. Furthermore, we face VAT risks arising out of the operating activities in the normal course of business and typical acquisition-related VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations.

In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European stability mechanism (the “ESM”), to be activated by mutual agreement and to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Eurozone countries after June 2013. In December 2011, the European Council and each Eurozone country agreed to a package of measures designed to restore confidence and address the continued tensions in financial markets, including (i) bringing forward implementation of the ESM from June 2013 to as soon as Member States representing 90% of the capital commitments to the ESM have ----- ratified the ESM treaty, which occurred on September 27, 2012, and (ii) a new fiscal compact between all 17 Eurozone countries and, subject to parliamentary vote, all other non-Eurozone countries (except the United Kingdom) to put deficit restrictions on Member State budgets, with associated sanctions for those Members States who violate the specified limits. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries (including, most recently, Cyprus and Slovenia) and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the Euro and the suitability of the Euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. These and other concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States or, even possibly, the dissolution of the Euro entirely. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-dominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the Euro such a supply contracts would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are Euro-denominated, such as the Notes, and, as we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in Euro, our financial condition may be materially affected.

The collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the collateral may be diluted by any increase in the firstpriority debt secured by the collateral or a reduction of the collateral securing the Notes. The value of the collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale, economic conditions where operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The collateral is located in more than one country, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the collateral may limit the realizable value of the collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks Related to the Notes,13.5.4,It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes.,"The collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of priority security interests in the collateral securing the ----- Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, under German law, the enforcement of a share pledge is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the collateral may decline significantly. You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges over shares of French companies by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such collateral in a public auction. Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be enforced following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount which is due and remaining unpaid. Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. If the secured creditors chose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte _commissoire). In a proceeding regarding a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire), an expert is appointed to value the pledged assets and if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the_ amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the pledged collateral and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. If the value of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets. Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an enforcement of the pledged assets could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of our group as a going concern.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture will each provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the collateral securing the Notes, except through the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Senior Notes Trustee, as the case may be, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the collateral. ----- With respect to certain jurisdictions, including Germany, France, Poland and the Netherlands (with respect to the pledge of shares), due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of certain security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the obligations under the Notes directly (a “Parallel Debt”). The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuers, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes and the Note Guarantees, the parallel debt construct has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions and we cannot assure you that it will be recognized or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of the pledge. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted. In respect of the Security Documents governed by French law it should be noted that none of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests created under the Parallel Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 no. 10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the collateral created under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 no 10-_ 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition (the “Trust Convention”), so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

First-priority security interests over the Shared Collateral will be granted for the benefit of creditors in respect of Senior Secured Liabilities. Holders of the Senior Notes may not be able to recover on the shares and other Shared Collateral that are also pledged or assigned as security for the Senior Secured liabilities because the creditors in respect thereof will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such pledges and other Shared Collateral and any distressed disposal with respect to such collateral, and the holders of the Senior Notes will need to share any remaining proceeds from such enforcement with any other secured creditor ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes.

If there are no excess proceeds, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than the aggregate amount of the obligations under the Senior Notes, the holders of Senior Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such collateral. In addition, the collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other collateral or that, if such market does exist, there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. The shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer because all of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (subject to the release mechanism in the Intercreditor Agreement) (including the Senior Notes Guarantees) must be satisfied prior to distribution to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s equity holders. As a result, the holders of the Senior Notes may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale of shares pledged in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In addition, the value of this collateral may fluctuate over time.

In addition, as the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

If the payments under profit and loss pooling agreements, distributions and intercompany loans do not lead to sufficient cash payments to the relevant Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuers’ ability to make payments may be limited and depend on factors beyond its control. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests or as loans or as payments under profit and loss pooling agreements, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to it. Under German law, all dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, in principle, interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law. However, it is uncertain under German law whether interim dividends may be allowed in certain circumstances, subject to strict conditions. The subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to either series of the Notes.

The liens on the collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Under German law, the creation of a valid security interest under a German law governed pledge agreement is subject to a delivery of a notice of pledge by the Security Agent or the security provider to the pledged company or a third party (e.g., notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over bank accounts). Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce such holder’s rights in the collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. In addition, generally a debtor may discharge its obligation under a receivable by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the receivable the security provider (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which comes into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) generally has priority.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The Original Subsidiary Guarantors will be organized under the laws of Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, if the court found that: - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; - the relevant Note Guarantee was entered into without a legal obligation to do so, is prejudicial to the interests of the other creditors and both the Guarantor and the beneficiary of the relevant Note Guarantee were aware of or should have been aware of the fact that it was still prejudicial to the other creditor; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider was: (i) insolvent ----- or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects or corporate purposes of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider.

Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to any of the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.5,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION Basis of Preparation,15.5.1,,"The following selected pro forma financial information is based on our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information included in this offering memorandum. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information was prepared in accordance with Annex II to the EU Regulation No 809/2004, as amended, based on the principles described in the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. It is based on the hypothetical assumption that the Nocibé Acquisition described under “Material Acquisitions and Divestitures—Acquisition of the Nocibé Group” had occurred on October 1, 2013, and, therefore, reflects the income statement situation of the hypothetical Douglas Group including the Nocibé Business for the entire period and excluding the Non-Acquired Business for the entire period. In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information reflects the pro forma effects of the following items: - It is assumed that in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, total legal, consulting and notary fees amounting to €18.6 million were incurred in the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013 instead of the period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014. Thus, Nocibé Acquisition-related costs of €15.8 million within other operating expenses, which were part of the EBITDA adjustments presented in the income statement of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, were eliminated for purposes of the pro forma consolidated income statement as they were assumed to be incurred in the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. Additionally, €2.8 million acquisition-related costs in the historical income statement of Nocibé Group for (i) the short financial year ended September 30, 2014 and (ii) the financial year ended December 31, 2013 were eliminated for purposes of the pro forma consolidated income statement as they were assumed to be incurred in the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. - In connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, the respective effects of the application of purchase accounting were reflected for the full financial year 2013/2014. - In connection with the financing of Nocibé Group, the beginning of the new financing was assumed effective as of October 1, 2013. Furthermore, it is assumed that the financing by Nocibé Group effective as of October 1, 2013 amounted to €275.0 million. The financing of AI Perfume France SAS, Villeneuve d’Ascq, France, (“AIP”) was effective as of October 1, 2013 and amounts to €255.0 million. - Interest expenses for the previously existing financing of Nocibé Group was eliminated for the period October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014. - It is assumed that transaction cost for the Nocibé Group loan were accrued and released over the term of the loan. The yearly release of transaction costs amounts to €2.4 million and is presented in financial expense. Furthermore it is assumed that the directly attributable transaction cost of €18.6 million is entirely tax-deductible, resulting in an income tax benefit (taking into account Nocibé Group’s statutory tax rate of 34.43%). - With respect to the impairment of €2.6 million caused by the IFRS 5 classification due to the requirement to sell thirteen stores in order for the Nocibé Acquisition to comply with national and EU competition law, it was assumed that the impairment was incurred prior to the transaction due to the fact that it was a pre-condition of the transaction and thus was not reflected in our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. These items (including the pro forma effects of the Nocibé Acquisition and the Separation of the NonAcquired Business) are collectively referred to as the “Nocibé Pro Forma Adjustments”. The Nocibé Pro Forma Adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we consider reasonable. Our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent our actual results of operations. It is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred during the period presented had the Nocibé Pro Forma Adjustments actually taken place as of the dates specified, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on our historical Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 and, thus, covers a different scope of consolidation as compared to our Audited Combined Financial Statements. Therefore, when comparing our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information ----- with our Audited Combined Financial Statements, certain material differences have to be taken into consideration, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Presentation of Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum and Factors Affecting Comparability”._ Our historical Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 accounted for the Nocibé Business as from the effective date for accounting purposes of the Nocibé Acquisition, i.e., from July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Consequently, the proportional income statement of the Nocibé Group relates to the period from October 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 in order to account for the Nocibé Business for the full financial year 2013/2014. Also, the Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5 (whereby the Confectionery Business was deconsolidated on April 30, 2014) in our historical Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014. Thus, in general terms, earnings from the discontinued operations were presented separately in a condensed form as an additional line item of the consolidated income statements for the financial year 2013/2014 below earnings from continued operations. The other line items above, only account for the continued operations, i.e. no contributions from the Non-Acquired Business were included above the line item “earnings from discontinued operations”.

The fair value adjustment for inventories made as a result of the PPA resulted in additional cost of merchandise in the amount of €24.3 million. This amount plus €8.1 million already recognized in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2013/2014 (and reflected in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 as part of the EBITDA adjustment) add up to the total PPA adjustment of €32.4 million. The €73.7 million EBITDA-adjustment presented in the segment reporting of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statement for the financial year 2013/2014 comprise the €8.1 million effect of the PPA. The total additional net amortization expense recognized as a result of the PPA amounted to €27.2 million for the period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014. As a result of this pro forma adjustment, income tax benefits in the amount of €9.4 million were recognized in the pro forma consolidated income statement for the period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, estimated based on the statutory tax rate of Nocibé Group of 34.43%. 2 The new financing of Nocibé Group was assumed to begin as of October 1, 2013 which resulted in an additional interest expense adjustment of €11.0 million. The interest rate of the new loan is based on the six-month EURIBOR for the first six month and on the three-month EURIBOR for each of the remaining two quarters. The margin for the first six month period was 4.00% p.a., after the six month interest period a margin step down was assumed with a margin of 3.75% p.a. for the remaining two quarters. The margin step-down results from an improved leverage margin which leads to a lower margin as agreed in the loan agreement. Interest expense from the previous financing of Nocibé Group was eliminated for the period October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014 amounting to €31.4 million. The financing of the acquisition via AIP was financed with a shareholder loan of €255.0 million. The interest rate of the loan is 9.68%. The acquisition related financing was assumed to begin as of October 1, 2013, which resulted in an additional interest expense adjustment of €17.8 million. In addition, financing related fees of €2.7 million, resulting from the redemption of the previous financing as well as the new financing, were eliminated for purposes of the pro forma consolidated income statement as they were assumed to be incurred in the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. 3 Acquisition-related costs of €15.8 million within other operating expenses, which were part of the EBITDA adjustments presented in the income statement of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statement for the financial year 2013/2014, were eliminated for purposes of the pro forma consolidated income statement as they were assumed to be incurred in the period from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013.

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,2405,SELECTED CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,2405.1,Introductory Note on Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum,2405.1.1,,"We have a complex financial history reflected by various sets of financial statements contained in this offering memorandum. The Company was incorporated on August 14, 2012 and, therefore, does not possess any historical financial information prior to this date. The Company commenced its operating activities by indirectly acquiring a 96.17% interest in Douglas Holding AG (which was the holding entity of the Douglas Group prior to the acquisition; such transaction, together with the subsequent squeeze-out carried out in 2013, pursuant to which the Company ----- indirectly acquired the remaining interest in Douglas Holding AG, as well as the delisting carried out in 2013 is herein referred to as the “First Douglas Acquisition”). Prior to the First Douglas Acquisition, the Douglas Group consisted of five operating businesses, namely the Douglas Perfumeries Business, the Confectionery Business, the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business. After the First Douglas Acquisition, we initiated comprehensive measures for a strategic reorganization and realignment of the Douglas Group with the objective of concentrating our operating activities on our core business relating to fragrances and cosmetics, namely the Douglas Perfumeries Business. The Confectionery Business was sold to a third party with effect as of April 30, 2014, and the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business were sold to companies controlled by the Company’s former sole shareholder, AI Beauty, with effect as of October 1, 2014. In addition, with effect for accounting purposes as of July 1, 2014, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired all shares in Groupe Nocibé SAS, a leading perfumeries chain in France (such transaction is herein referred to as the “Nocibé Acquisition”; Groupe Nocibé SAS, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries and associated companies, the “Nocibé Group” and the business of the Nocibé Group the “Nocibé Business”). In order to present the effects of the Nocibé Acquisition as if it had been acquired as of October 1, 2013, Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared and is included in this offering memorandum. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on the hypothetical assumption that the Nocibé Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2013, and, therefore, reflects (i) the income statement situation of the hypothetical Douglas Group including the Nocibé Business for the entire period and excluding the Non-Acquired Business which was accounted for in a condensed form under the separate line item “earnings from discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS 5—“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” for the entire period, (ii) the respective effects of the application of purchase accounting for the full financial year 2013/2014 and (iii) certain other pro forma effects primarily relating to the financing of Nocibé Group and the transaction costs of the Nocibé Acquisition, in each case for the full financial year 2013/2014. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information—Nocibé.” In order to provide historical financial information for three full financial years 2011/2012 to 2013/2014 on a more comparable basis, Audited Combined Financial Statements have been prepared and are included in this offering memorandum. The purpose of our Audited Combined Financial Statements is to provide historical financial information of the Douglas Perfumeries Business. Our Audited Combined Financial Statements include (i) Douglas Holding AG and all such direct and indirect subsidiaries and associated companies of Douglas Holding AG pertaining to the perfumeries business division (except for the Nocibé Group), as well as certain service entities and intermediate holdings, including two companies of the former Books Business and Fashion Business with no assets or liabilities (together the “Douglas Perfumeries Business”) as well as (ii) the Nocibé Group as from the effective date for accounting purposes of the Nocibé Acquisition, i.e., from July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014 ((i) to (ii) together the “Acquired Business”). However, they do not include the Company, Beauty Holding One GmbH or Beauty Holding Two GmbH (the direct and indirect parent companies of Douglas Holding AG) (the Company, Beauty Holding One GmbH and Beauty Holding Two GmbhH, together the “Holding Companies”) nor do they include the entities relating to the Non-Acquired Business, other than the two subsidiaries that functioned as intermediate holding entities relating to the Books and Fashion Business. In the financial year 2013/2014, effects from Holding Companies included, in particular, administrative holding costs of €1.5 million, as well as financing costs of €89.7 million. In the financial year 2012/2013, effects from Holding Companies included, in particular, administrative holding costs of €2.7 million, as well as financing costs of €20.7 million relating to a bank loan. In addition, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are the audited consolidated financial statements of Beauty Holding Zero GmbH. For the financial year 2012/2013, our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements cover our operative business only for the ten-month period December 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. Until the dates of its deconsolidation, the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements still include the Non-Acquired Business. However, in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, the Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5—“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”. Due to the reclassification of the Non-Acquired Business in accordance with IFRS 5 in the financial year 2013/2014, the comparative figures for the financial year 2012/2013 regarding the income statements and the statements of cash flows (but not the statements of financial position) in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 were adjusted in accordance with IFRS 5 and only include the Non-Acquired Business in a condensed form, whereas, regarding the statements of financial position, they still fully account for the Non-Acquired Business. Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014 only include the Nocibé Business for the three-month period from July 1, 2014 until September 30, 2014. The information contained in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial years 2013/2014 and 2012/2013 is not comparable due to ----- the fact that (i) the Company acquired an indirect majority interest in Douglas Holding AG only in December 2012 so that, as a consequence, the consolidated income statements and statements of cash flows for 2012/2013 only accounted for the Douglas Group from December 1, 2012 and not for the entire financial year 2012/2013; (ii) in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, the Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5 (whereby the Confectionery Business was deconsolidated on April 30, 2014), while, in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013 such Non-Acquired Business was fully consolidated; and (iii) we, the Douglas Group, acquired the Nocibé Group in June 2014 leading to significant extraordinary effects to certain line items of our consolidated income statements, statements of financial position and statements of cash flows for 2013/2014. Furthermore, Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015 are included in this offering memorandum. Whereas the comparative figures for the first half of 2013/2014 still account for the Non-Acquired Business which, in the statements of financial position, was fully consolidated, and, in the income statements and the statements of cash flows, was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5, the financial information for the first half of 2014/2015 does not include the Confectionery Business (which was sold to a third party with effect as of April 30, 2014 and was deconsolidated accordingly). In addition, the sales and transfers of the Non-Acquired Business (excluding the Confectionery Business which had been sold, transferred and, thus, deconsolidated on April 30, 2014) were accounted as the first booking entry on October 1, 2014 in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Thus, our statement of financial positions after the deconsolidation of the Non-Acquired Business, only reflected the Acquired Business. Also, the income statements and the statements of cash flows contained in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements only reflected the Acquired Business but not the Non-Acquired Business for the first half of 2014/2015. In addition, the comparative figures for the first half of 2013/2014 did not account for the Nocibé Group which at that time had not yet been acquired by the Douglas Group, whereas the Nocibé Business is fully accounted for in the first half of 2014/2015. Due to the factors described above, when comparing financial information used in this offering memorandum corresponding to the different sets of financial statements and the different periods, investors should take into account the material differences resulting from the First Douglas Acquisition and the subsequent refinancing, the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business and the Nocibé Acquisition, as well as the resulting changes regarding the composition of the Douglas Group. Because of such effects, the financial information as presented in the different sets of financial statements included in this offering memorandum may not be fully comparable. The following table shows—in a condensed form—which set of financial statements used in this offering memorandum includes or excludes effects relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business, the Nocibé Business, the NonAcquired Business as well as the Holding Companies:",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Also, the income statements and the statements of cash flows contained in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements only reflected the Acquired Business but not the Non-Acquired Business for the first half of 2014/2015. 6 The Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5 regarding the income statements and the statements of cash flows; regarding the statements of financial position, the Non-Acquired Business was fully consolidated. 7 Comprising the Nocibé Business as from the effective date for accounting purposes of the Nocibé Acquisition, i.e., from July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. 8 The Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5 (whereby the Confectionery Business was deconsolidated on April 30, 2014). Due to the reclassification of the Non-Acquired Business in accordance with IFRS 5 in the financial year 2013/2014, the comparative figures for the financial year 2012/2013 regarding the income statements and the statements of cash flows (but not the statements of financial position) were adjusted according to IFRS 5. To allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison of the audited consolidated financial information for the financial years 2013/2014 and 2012/2013, unless otherwise indicated, financial information for the financial year 2012/2013 contained in this offering memorandum is based on the comparative financial information included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014. 9 The Non-Acquired Business was fully consolidated. However, unless otherwise indicated, financial information for the financial year 2012/2013 contained in this offering memorandum is not based on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/13, but on the comparative financial information included in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, where it was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5; see note 8 above for further details. 10 Data including the Nocibé Group for the entire period on the hypothetical assumption that the Nocibé Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2013. 11 Earnings from the Non-Acquired Business were presented separately in a condensed form as an additional line item of the pro forma consolidated income statements for the financial year 2013/2014. 12 Refers to the holding companies of Douglas Holding AG.

In our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business which were accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 were separated as the first booking entry on October 1, 2014 and deconsolidated on that date.

For further details see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Presentation of Financial Information Used in this _Offering Memorandum and Factors Affecting Comparability—Presentation of the Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum—Audited Combined Financial Statements”._ 6 Net sales growth (in %) is defined as the difference between the sales in the period indicated and the sales in the comparable previous period divided by the sales in said comparable previous period. 7 E-commerce sales are defined as the sum of all invoiced sales relating to products and services by customer orders via websites, internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t” sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a mobile or “smart” telephone) and, for Germany, telephone orders after cancellations and backorders, as well as rebates, discounts and returns, disregarding any stock transfer from e-commerce to stationary business. E-commerce sales as shown in this table only relate to those of our online shops which are centrally managed, including our online shops operated in Germany, France (including, for the first half of 2014/2015, e-commerce sales in the amount of €22.4 million from the Nocibé Business), the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland. 8 Like-for-like sales growth (in %) consists of sales growth (excluding the Nocibé Business, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business) from like-forlike stores calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period, and includes e-commerce sales growth, shown as a percentage change. A store is defined as like-for-like when it has been open for at least one entire financial year as of the lock-in date. The lock-in date for the like-for-like stores’ portfolio for the first half of 2014/2015 and 2013/2014, as well as the financial years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012 is the first day of the relevant period. 9 Like-for-like sales growth (stationary) (in %) consists of sales (excluding the Nocibé Business, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business) from like-for-like stores (as defined above) calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period. 10 Like-for-like sales growth (e-commerce) (in %) reflects our e-commerce sales growth, calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period. 11 EBITDA (calculated as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses and plus income from other investments) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA as shown in the table above is unadjusted. 12 Adjusted EBITDA comprises reported EBITDA, adjusted for exceptional items. Exceptional items related to (i) consulting fees, in the financial year 2012/2013 in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, including consulting fees in relation to the squeeze-out in May 2013 and the delisting in August 2013, as well as, in the financial year 2013/2014 in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business and the implementation of certain efficiency measures, (ii) restructuring costs, primarily relating to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and severance payments, (iii) effects from PPA related, in the financial year 2013/2014, to the Nocibé Acquisition and (iv) other exceptional items including, in the financial year 2013/2014, one-off inventory revaluations, synergy bonuses for Nocibé’s management, property tax payments related to a corporate restructuring, as well as rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. Exceptional items in the first half of 2014/2015 related to (i) PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, (ii) consulting fees mainly in connection with the Company in sale process and the Nocibé Acquisition as well as consulting fees in connection with the acquisition of Clin d’Oeil and the sales and transfers of the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business effective as of October 1, 2014, (iii) restructuring costs from the recognition of a provision with respect to certain legal disputes and severance payments and (iv) other exceptional items which mainly related to rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. In the first half of 2014/2015, the Austrian Supreme Court found that the taking private of the Douglas Group constituted a change of control within the means of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law (Mietrechtsgesetz) and rejected the argument that the act violates the freedom of establishment (Niederlassungsfreiheit) and the freedom of movement of capital (Kapitalverkehrsfreiheit) under the European Union Treaty. As a result, rent increases in the amount of €1.3 million which were adjusted in the financial year 2013/2014 as extraordinary effects, must be classified from now on as recurring effects and consequently may not be adjusted from the financial year 2014/2015 onwards which has been reflected in our Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS.

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview of the Business Activities of the Douglas Group,17.1.1,,"We are the leading European specialist retailer of selective beauty and personal care products, with total pro forma sales of €2,494.3 million, pro forma EBITDA of €173.8 million and adjusted pro forma EBITDA of €256.0 million in the financial year 2013/2014. The vast majority of our sales are generated within the selective beauty distribution channel, which requires the formal approval of a supplier to carry a selective product, as opposed to the mass market channel. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate in 19 European countries with over 1,700 stores (including franchised stores) and have e-commerce operations in 15 countries. In five of our six core countries (i.e., in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Austria), we have a top 1 or top 2 market position. In those five core countries, we generated over 80% of our sales in the financial year 2013/2014 on a pro forma basis. Since being taken private in the financial year 2012/2013, Douglas has been transformed from a predominantly German diversified retail conglomerate into a leading pan-European selective beauty retailer. Our former non-beauty operating retail businesses were either sold to a third party or to subsidiaries of AI Beauty. Substantial operational improvement initiatives have been implemented over the past two years, particularly in the financial year 2013/2014, the first full financial year under our new management team, to further enhance our business model and position it for continued profitable growth going forward. In June 2014, we acquired the Nocibé Group, a leading beauty retailer in France to further strengthen our market position in France and as the leading specialist retailer of selective beauty and personal care products in Europe. With an estimated CAGR for calendar years 2013-2019 of 2.6%, the European selective beauty market, which generally has shown a high degree of resilience even in periods of extended down cycles, is expected to exhibit attractive and sustainable growth and reach an overall market volume of €18.2 billion in 2019. We primarily operate under the “Douglas” brand across countries. In France and Monaco, we are integrating all operations under the “Nocibé” brand after the acquisition of the Nocibé Group and its successful subsequent integration. As of today, only a few remaining stores in France still operate under the “Douglas” brand, with the brand switch ongoing. With up to 35,000 different articles (SKUs as of March 31, 2015; based on our German online shop), we offer one of the industry’s largest beauty and personal care product assortments available in our stationary stores and online. This assortment is complemented by a range of beauty-related accessories as well as selected service offerings. Our extensive product offerings across a wide range of price points make us a preferred brand for selective beauty and ----- personal care in Europe. We believe that we distinguish ourselves by a customer-centric sales approach offering our customers high quality advice and services and that this, together with our reputation and our broad, well-invested store network in prime locations, as well as e-commerce capabilities, make us a “must-have” distribution platform for the major suppliers of selective beauty products. We believe we are a pioneer in multi-channel selective beauty retailing in Europe, with highly integrated stationary store and e-commerce (including online and mobile) customer interfaces which allow our customers to browse online and buy in-store, or “click-and-collect”. We have continuously invested in our e-commerce business with online shops in 15 countries and believe that we are one of the leading selective beauty online retailers in Europe. Particularly, we are the online market leader in the German market for selective beauty products, accounting for a share of approximately 51% in 2013, according to the OC&C Report. Going forward, the German selective beauty online market is expected to further benefit from substantial growth at a CAGR for the 2013-2019 of 17.5%, according to the OC&C Report. Our e-commerce sales pertaining to our centrally managed online shops amounted to €229.3 million in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, corresponding to 9.4% of our total sales of which €22.4 million was attributable to the e-commerce sales from the Nocibé Business in the first half of 2014/2015. In the financial year 2013/2014, our e-commerce sales amounted to €180.0 million, or 8.6% of our total sales, corresponding to a CAGR of 30.4% during the financial year 2011/2012 to 2013/2014. We believe that our established German e-commerce platform can serve as a blueprint for our e-commerce activities in other countries, for example, through transposition of best practices. As of March 31, 2015, we had more than 17,000 employees (including trainees).",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Development of the European Selective Beauty Market,17.3.1,,"We generate our sales predominately in the selective beauty distribution channel, which unlike the mass market channel, is based on distribution contracts requiring formal approval of suppliers before a retailer can carry a selective product. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position have historically been affected by developments in this market and by the general economic climate in regional markets where we operate, in particular in Germany and France. The selective beauty market segment in most of Europe has demonstrated resilience even throughout more challenging retail trading environments, including during the European financial crisis. Beauty products (color cosmetics, skin care and also fragrances) are often perceived as accessible high-value gifts and so-called “personal rewards”, which has contributed to the demand for such products in general remaining stable historically and showing resilience even during periods of extended economic downturns. In Europe’s two largest markets (and also our key countries) Germany and France, the selective beauty market has historically strongly outgrown the larger mass retailing market for beauty and personal care products (5.0% against 1.4% CAGR for the calendar years 2009-2013, respectively, in Germany, and 3.1% against 1.2% CAGR for the same period, respectively, in France). We believe that this development is based on long-term, growth-driving consumer and industry megatrends such as beauty and care products, in general, and certain target customer groups, in particular gaining importance (from the Generation 50+ to very young female adolescents); beauty products being regarded as “personal rewards”; “anti-aging” and appearance consciousness, for example also by male customers; a tendency to regard shopping as an experience; an increasing desire to express personality and turn away from the mass; as well as new trends towards natural/medical beauty products. However, in Southern Europe, with a persistent decline of gross domestic product per capita, the typically resilient selective market was affected (CAGR for the calendar years 2008- 2013: -3.1%, gross domestic product decline was 0.9% p.a. during this period). In addition to the overall growth of our business, the growth of our sales during the last three financial years from €1,938.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €1,979.1 million and €1,992.1 million in the financial years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014, respectively, also reflected the resilience of the selective beauty market segment in most of Europe (the figure for the financial year 2013/2014 excludes sales contributions from the Nocibé Business in the period ----- July 1 to September 30, 2014, i.e., only relates to the Douglas Perfumeries Business). In the first half of 2014/2015, our sales, on a consolidated basis, increased to €1,454.9 million as compared to €1,108.1 million in the first half of 2013/2014, of which an amount of €308.9 million resulted from the acquisition of the Nocibé Business (while additional €60.1 million related to sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions of the Nocibé Business with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France, which were eliminated on consolidation) which was not part of our Group during the first half of 2013/2014. Besides the contributions from the Nocibé Business, the increase in our sales in the first half of 2014/2015 was driven in part by a strong Christmas business as compared to the previous year due to increased consumer confidence. In order to address the specific challenges in the South-western European market, we have, in the last two financial years, undertaken a significant number of actions across countries, with a particular focus on Southern Europe, to improve overall profitability and build a platform for growth. These measures included the strengthening of regional leadership and management, a significant store portfolio restructuring in Spain, enhanced in-store selling efforts, a change in product mix more tailored to local markets, purchasing savings through a group-wide program and a staff efficiency program across numerous countries (see also “—Cost Base and Efficiency Measures”). In particular as a consequence of these measures and in the wake of the beginning economic recovery in this region, in the first half of 2014/2015, the performance of our segment South-western Europe improved with an increase in both sales (net) and Adjusted EBITDA from €269.9 million and €21.2 million, respectively, in the first half of 2013/2014 to €276.5 million and €22.9 million, respectively, in the first half of 2014/2015. In the coming years, the selective beauty market segment is expected to continue to outgrow the mass beauty and personal care market in many European countries. For example, in Germany, according to the OC&C Report, the selective beauty market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% for the 2013-2019 period, which compares to 1.5% for the mass channel regarding beauty and personal care products for the same period, while in France, the selective beauty market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.0% for the 2013-2019 period, against a 1.2% CAGR for the mass channel regarding beauty and personal care products for the same period, according to the OC&C Report. Strong growth in Eastern Europe is expected to be another important driver of the European selective beauty market at a CAGR of 5.5% for the 2013-2019 period according to the OC&C Report. In particular, growth in the Polish selective beauty market is expected to further accelerate—the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6.2% over the same period (source: OC&C Report).

However, in accordance with our overall strategy, e-commerce has seen a particular strong growth in recent financial years and has contributed above-average to our overall like-for-like growth. This development was underpinned by a strong underlying growth of the online selective beauty market, as well as recent improvements to our e-commerce platform and the pan-European roll-out of this platform. Driven by constant changes in customer demand and shopping behavior, we have continuously invested in multi-channel distribution capacities, including our e-commerce platform, and have implemented organizational changes to integrate our stationary and online businesses. Although we see ourselves as the leading multi-channel pioneer in selective beauty retailing in Europe, with highly integrated stationary, online and mobile customer interfaces (which, for example, allow our customers to browse online/mobile and buy in-store, or “click-and-collect”), we expect such investments to continue in the future. Our online shops have been an important source of profitable growth in the past few years and our results of operations have been positively influenced by the on-going trend towards e-commerce and multi-channel distribution. In the first half of 2014/2015, our e-commerce sales pertaining to our centrally managed online shops (as defined below) amounted to €145.3 million, corresponding to 10.0% of our total sales. For the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, our e-commerce sales totaled €229.3 million, or 9.4% of our total sales. E-commerce sales amounted to €180.0 million, corresponding to 8.6% of our overall sales in the financial year 2013/2014 and have been growing at a CAGR of 30.4% over the financial years 2011/2012 to 2013/2014. Of this increase of our e-commerce sales in the first half of 2014/2015, and consequently also in the twelve-month-period ended March 31, 2015, an amount of €22.4 million resulted from the first time consideration of the e-commerce sales from the Nocibé Business. When adjusted to exclude this effect, our e-commerce sales would have increased to €122.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015 and to €206.9 million in the twelve-month-period ended March 31, 2015. We define e-commerce sales as the sum of all invoiced sales relating to products and services by customer orders via websites, internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t” sites), or “apps” (applications designed to ----- optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a mobile or “smart” telephone) and, for Germany, telephone orders after cancellations and backorders, as well as rebates, discounts and returns, disregarding any stock transfer from e-commerce to stationary business for those of our online shops which are centrally managed (including our online shops operated in Germany, France including, for the first half of 2014/2015, also e-commerce sales in the amount of €22.4 million from the Nocibé Business, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland, together the “centrally managed online shops”).

Data excludes the Nocibé Business. 2 Thereof €22.4 million was attributable to the e-commerce sales of the Nocibé Business in the first half of 2014/2015. 3 We define the number of orders as the number of customer orders placed in the financial year after cancelations and backorders; an order is counted on the day we fulfill the order. 4 Sales growth (e-commerce) reflects our e-commerce sales growth, shown as a percentage change after the elimination of the e-commerce sales of the Nocibé Business in the amount of €22.4 million in the first half of 2014/2015. 5 We define the number of active customers as the sum of all customers placing at least one order per financial year for which an invoice has been issued, whereby a customer ordering multiple times under a guest account will be counted as multiple customers. 6 We calculate site visits as the number of series of page requests from the same device and source (either via websites, internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t” sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a mobile or “smart” telephone) in the respective period as recorded via the analytics tool Webtrekk. A visit is considered ended when no requests have been recorded in more than 30 minutes. 7 We define the average basket size per order as the total amount spent by our customers (excluding VAT) after cancelations and returns divided by the number of delivered orders after cancelations in the financial year. 8 We define the return rate as the ratio of the number of returned products and the number of products ordered, after cancellations and backorders and disregarding any stock transfer from e-commerce to stationary business. 9 We define the conversion rate as the amount of all past customer orders before returns but after cancelations and backorders without relocations in a selected period divided by the number of visits in that period. 10 We define fulfillment costs as the sum of cost of freight, packaging material cost and storage cost attributable to our online shops which are centrally managed, including our online shops operated in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland, excluding costs attributable to the Nocibé Business. Online sales of the Nocibé Group also showed significant growth, increasing by 45.9% from €15.0 million in 2012 to €21.9 million in 2013. However, as a percentage of total sales of the Nocibé Group, online sales amounted to 4.5% and 3.2% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing a significantly lower portion of total sales as compared to the percentage of e-commerce sales of the Douglas Perfumeries Business. In the short financial year 2014, online sales contributed 4.1% of total sales of the Nocibé Group. We believe that our established German e-commerce platform can serve as a blueprint for our future French e-commerce activities, for example, through the transposition of best practices. The continued growth of the Douglas Perfumeries Business’ e-commerce platform has been accompanied by an increase of related variable costs, in particular cost of freight and packaging costs, which, on a relative basis, represent a larger portion in relation to our e-commerce cost base than in relation to our stationary stores. However, expressed as a ----- percentage of e-commerce sales, these variable costs have constantly decreased during the last three financial years. Furthermore, despite the impact of our growing e-commerce business, our overall costs of transferring merchandise have been relatively stable during the last three financial years due to efficiency and improvement measures related to our logistic costs in general and, in particular, to our logistic costs attributable to our stationary stores.

For further details see “—Presentation of Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum and Factors Affecting Comparability—Presentation of the _Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum—Audited Combined Financial Statements”._ 3 Total floor space (in thousand m², as of balance sheet date) relates to our directly operated stationary stores only (i.e., excluding franchised stores). 4 Average sales per m² (in €thousand) is calculated as our gross sales from our stationary stores (including sales from the sale of products, from services and taxexempt sales) for the indicated period divided by the weighted average square meters (weighted by reference to the number of months during the referenced period such retail store was held by Douglas) of our stationary stores. 5 Number of stores (owned) represents directly operated stores only, but not franchised stores. 6 Store openings comprise those directly operated stationary stores which generated sales for the first time in the period indicated. 7 Store acquisitions comprise those directly operated stationary stores which were acquired from a third party in the period indicated. 8 Store closures comprise those directly operated stationary stores which were closed in the period indicated. 9 Due to the Nocibé Acquisition during the financial year 2013/2014, data for the Douglas Group including the Nocibé Business cannot be calculated in a meaningful way. Instead, the figure shown relates to the Douglas Perfumeries Business only. In the first half of the financial year 2014/2015, acquisitions of directly operated stores related to the acquisitions of Himmer with five perfumeries in Munich, Germany and Clin d’Oeil with 43 perfumeries in France. Of the 43 perfumeries pertaining to Clin d’Oeil, seven perfumeries are required to be divested to comply with national and EU competition law. The acquisition of 373 directly operated stores in the financial year 2013/2014, related to the Nocibé Acquisition of which 13 directly operated stores (together with 25 additional franchised stores) have to be sold in order for the Nocibé Acquisition to comply with national and EU competition law. ----- In the last three financial years, we actively managed our store portfolio, concentrating more on the optimization, i.e., closing or replacing stores with lower profitability with stores in better locations as appropriate, and less on the expansion of our store network, which changed in the first half of 2014/2015 as further expansion has again become the focus of our attention. In the last three financial years, our openings of directly operated stores primarily focused on Eastern Europe, in particular on Poland, where we had identified certain opportunities to increase the number of stores. Furthermore, we implemented selected closures in recent years to further optimize our store network, with the peak in the financial year 2012/2013. In order to address the challenges in the South-western European market which mainly resulted from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, we implemented a number of actions across the region, also with a particular focus on Spain. These actions included a store closure program in the financial year 2012/2013, when we closed 15 stationary stores in Spain (on a net basis). Store closures continued in the financial year 2013/2014, albeit, with 6 stationary stores closed in Spain (on a net basis). In addition, we enhanced in-store selling efforts and tailored our product mix to the applicable markets, also with a focus on South-western Europe. In the Eastern Europe segment, we closed 9 (on a net basis) in the financial year 2012/2013 and opened 9 (on a net basis) in the financial year 2013/2014. Our capital expenditures, on a combined basis, totaled €48.6 million, €45.1 million and €64.3 million in the financial years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012, respectively. The majority of these capital expenditures related to investments in the refurbishment, maintenance, design and re-design of existing stores. The level of these refurbishment and maintenance capital expenditures was relatively stable over the last three financial years. At the same time, we have implemented a more efficient, centralized sourcing approach which led to improved purchasing terms, for example, with respect to shop fittings. The remaining part of our capital expenditures mainly related to the opening and acquisition of new stores, whereby those capital expenditures were higher in the financial year 2011/2012 as compared to the financial years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014, in particular due to the opening of certain larger stationary stores in the financial year 2011/2012. Of our capital expenditures for the financial year 2013/2014 of €48.6 million, capital expenditures in the amount of €5.8 million related to the Nocibé Business. In the first half of 2014/2015, capital expenditures totaled €34.1 million or 2.3% of sales, and related in principle to the same categories.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.8,Growth and Value-Creation Initiatives,17.8.1,,"In the financial year 2012/2013 and in particular in the financial year 2013/2014, the first full financial year under our new management team, we implemented a number of operational and strategic initiatives to increase store productivity and like-for-like sales with respect to both e-commerce and stationary stores. Such initiatives included on the stationary side, the continuous improvement of our in-store offerings, the introduction of a new visual design, the roll-out of new product displays, improvement of visual merchandizing and marketing concepts, the use of professionalized space management and strengthened best practice sharing across the countries in which we operate. In addition, in 2013, we developed and began the roll-out of a new corporate design with a new visual identity as part of a broader initiative to rejuvenate the Douglas brand image. We believe that these measures will be a key driver for increased store traffic, customer conversion rates and average volume per purchase going forward, effects which we have already experienced in the first half of 2014/2015 where our sales grew on a like-for-like basis by 3.9% overall, with stationary sales increasing by 1.5% on a like-for-like basis. Furthermore, changes in our product mix have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our sales and operating profit as profit margins for different categories and products vary. In particular, our private label and exclusive products recently have acted as sales and gross profit margin drivers and, also, allow for differentiation vis-à-vis key competitors. The aggregated sales share of our private label and exclusive products accounted for 16.8% of our total sales in the financial year 2013/2014 (figures adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Nocibé Business in the period July to September 2014). When adjusted to combine the Nocibé Business and the Douglas Perfumeries Business, private label products accounted for 2.8% of our total aggregated sales in the financial year 2013/2014 (figures adjusted to include the Nocibé Business for the whole financial year 2013/2014). Our exclusive products and, notwithstanding their lower average price points, our private label products generally have higher gross margins than products from third party brands because of less price pressure or lower sourcing expenses. On a product category basis, skin care and color cosmetics products both were slightly above average, while fragrances are slightly below average as compared to our Group’s overall gross profit margin in the recent past. We believe that the Nocibé Acquisition will further positively impact our private label business. The Nocibé Group rapidly grew the sales share of its private label products since the implementation of its dedicated private label strategy in April 2012 and, in the short financial year ended September 30, 2014, generated a significantly larger share of their sales from private label products than the Douglas Perfumeries Business in the financial year 2013/2014. However, we believe that the sales share of Nocibé’s private label products in the short financial year ended ----- September 30, 2014 was still significantly below the private label share of best-in-class competitors such as Sephora, indicating substantial private label growth potential for our Group. We believe that the strong growth of private label products of the Nocibé Group helped and will continue helping to further increase the attractiveness and affordability of the products. In particular, the private label expansion at Nocibé positively impacted store traffic as, for example, private label customers showed an increased visit frequency as compared to other customers, led to significantly improved average purchase value for private label customers, which we believe was not at the expense of other product types, and also enabled Nocibé to access a more “trend-oriented” target group with new and younger customers, thereby rejuvenating and broadening Nocibé’s customer base and image. Since the Nocibé Acquisition, we have begun to leverage these private label capabilities developed by the Nocibé Group in France increasingly across other European countries in order to further complement our assortment of products, attract new customers, drive customer loyalty and further improve our margins. For example, we have recently launched Nocibé’s comprehensive “Black” private label make-up range under the “Douglas” brand which, after roll-out in March 2015 in eleven countries, is expected to become available in all countries in which we operate during the course of 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.9,Cost Base and Efficiency Measures,17.9.1,,"Fixed costs represent a major share of our cost base and, consequently, are an important factor in determining our financial results. Our fixed costs include rental expenses and energy costs. Personnel expenses have both a fixed and semi-variable component due to the hiring of temporary workers during the peak selling periods and variable compensation components. When offsetting our marketing and advertising costs for other operating income from marketing and advertising costs recharged, personnel expenses, as well as rental and energy costs were our largest cost factors in the periods under review. Personnel expenses include the costs of staff in our directly operated stationary stores, staff operating our online shops and staff in our headquarters and other business operations performing mainly administrative, centralized and service functions. The compensation of our store employees includes a variable component based on the level of sales, which leads to some degree of fluctuation with respect to personnel costs. We also manage personnel expenses in our stores, to a certain degree, by varying staffing levels in anticipation of customer traffic. In particular in the financial year 2013/2014, the first full financial year under our new management team, we implemented operational measures with a view to downsize overhead personnel and other staff to further improve overhead efficiency and to realize personnel efficiencies across our store portfolio in a number of countries, in particular through staff reduction measures implemented in Germany in May and June 2014. In Germany, in the financial year 2013/2014 and the first half of financial year 2014/2015, more than 300 store and overhead employees were made redundant. Furthermore, besides these measures in Germany, stationary store staff efficiency measures were implemented in certain other countries, particularly in the Netherlands, and also to a lesser extent in Austria and Italy. These actions included a store closure program in the financial year 2012/2013 and 2013/2014, when we closed a number of stationary stores in Spain and Croatia, as described above. Furthermore, we have recently focused on excellence in the execution of our processes, for example through the centralization and systematization of selected functions such as assortment planning, procurement, pricing and campaigning as well as through the improvement of support and administrative processes. For example, in 2013/2014, we negotiated and implemented Europe-wide sourcing contracts with our most important suppliers of goods for resale in order to secure competitive margins. In addition, we launched a comprehensive sourcing program in the financial year 2013/2014 to improve sourcing of indirect goods, such as energy, marketing materials or logistics, facility management and IT services, which led to further cost savings of approximately €3 million. Our personnel expenses, which are in the vast majority fixed in the short term, increased from €438.0 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €442.1 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and €470.7 million in the financial year 2013/2014. However, our personnel expenses adjusted for extraordinary effects in the amount of €16.6 million in the financial year 2013/2014, €3.7 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and €0.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012 (for further details, see “—Results of Operations for the Financial Years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and _2011/2012 (Combined)—Personnel Expenses—Comparison of the Financial Years 2013/2014 and 2012/2013 (Combined)” and “—Results of Operations for the Financial Years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012 (Combined)—Personnel Expenses—Comparison of the Financial Years 2012/2013 and 2011/2012 (Combined)”), in each_ case mainly related to severance payments in connection with the above described staff reduction measures as well as, in the financial year 2013/2014 effects from the Nocibé Business, increased slightly from €437.3 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €438.4 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and €454.1 million in the financial year 2013/2014. On the same basis, expressed as a percentage of sales, our adjusted personnel expenses decreased from 22.6% in the ----- financial year 2011/2012, to 22.2% in the financial year 2012/2013 and 21.7% in the financial year 2013/2014, primarily as a result of the above described personnel related measures. In the first half of 2014/2015, our personnel expenses adjusted for extraordinary effects in the amount of €1.6 million increased to €278.1 million, as compared to €232.6 million in the first half of 2013/2014 (where adjustments for extraordinary effects totaled €6.0 million, in each case mainly related to severance payments in connection with the above described staff reduction). This increase in our adjusted personnel expenses in the first half of 2014/2015 was mainly the result of the first time consolidation of the Nocibé Business. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our adjusted personnel expenses decreased from 21.0% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 19.1% in the first half of 2014/2015. In the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, our adjusted personnel expenses amounted to €499.6 million, or, 20.5% of sales. These recent improvements of our adjusted personnel expenses ratio mainly resulted from the aforementioned cost base and efficiency measures, in particular the headcount reductions in overhead functions as well as at the store level. With respect to our other selling, general and administrative costs, which we define as the netted figure from other operating expenses and other operating income (the “other SG&A costs”), increased from €359.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €368.7 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and €420.4 million in the financial year 2013/2014.

Expressed as a percentage of sales, our adjusted other SG&A costs decreased from 18.4% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 18.0% in the financial year 2012/2013 and 17.9% in the financial year 2013/2014. In the first half of 2014/2015, our other SG&A costs, adjusted for extraordinary effects of €11.7 million mainly relating to consulting fees in connection with the potential sale of the business and the Nocibé Acquisition and restructuring costs related to the recognition of a provision with respect to certain legal disputes and severance payments, increased to €235.6 million from €193.4 million in the first half of 2013/2014 where adjustments amounted to €9.0 million (mainly related to the implementation of above described efficiency measures and consulting fees in connection with the financing of the Group) also primarily due to the first time consolidation of the Nocibé Business. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our adjusted other SG&A costs significantly decreased to 16.2% in the first half of 2014/2015 from 17.5% in the first half of 2013/2014. In the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, our adjusted other SG&A costs totaled €418.5 million, or, expressed as a percentage of sales, 17.2%. These recent improvements of our adjusted other SG&A ratio were mainly a result of the aforementioned cost base and efficiency measures, in particular the initiatives to centralize functions such as purchasing, as well as benefits from the Nocibé Business which has lower SG&A costs as percentage of sales due to their efficient cost management as compared to the Douglas Perfumeries Business. With respect to rental costs, most of our lease agreements provide for fixed monthly lease payments, however some of the lease agreements contain sales-related additional lease payments, meaning that a portion of the lease payments is tied to the level of sales generated in the respective store, subject to a minimum lease payment floor. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions such as France, rents automatically increase pursuant to applicable law on the anniversary date of a lease in accordance with an official index or are otherwise tied to other indices (such as the _Baupreisindex in Germany). Rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs, on a combined basis) increased from_ €167.0 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €172.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and €181.9 million (of which €7.9 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business) in the financial year 2013/2014. Expressed as a percentage of sales, rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs) have been relatively stable in the last three financial years. In the first half of 2014/2015, rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs) amounted to €105.2 million as compared to €89.7 million in the first half of 2013/2014. This increase was attributable to the Nocibé Business which accounted for rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs) of €16.1 million in the first half of 2014/2015. Expressed as a percentage of sales, rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs) decreased to 7.2% in the first half of 2014/2015 from 8.1% in the first half of 2013/2014. In the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, our rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs) totaled €202.1 million or 8.3% of sales. These recent improvements of our rent expenses (excluding ancillary costs) ratio was mainly a result of the strong increase of our e-commerce sales and also of comparatively low rent expenses as percentage of sales from the Nocibé Business. The first results of these growth and value-creation initiatives described above were the main drivers which led to the improvement of our Adjusted EBITDA margin from 8.9% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 9.1% in the financial year 2012/2013, 9.5% in the financial year 2013/2014, 10.3% in the financial year 2013/2014 as based on our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information to 11.2% in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015. Accordingly, our ----- Adjusted EBITDA increased from €173.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €180.7 million and €199.5 million the financial years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 corresponding to a CAGR of 7.3%. In the financial year 2013/2014, as based on our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, our Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €256.0 million. In the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, our Adjusted EBITDA totaled €272.8 million. Thus, when compared to the financial year 2011/2012, our Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015 was more than €100 million higher, primarily due to the increase in sales which we were able to grow organically and through acquisitions, but also as a result of significant savings in SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales). In the first half of 2014/2015, our Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 12.4% from 9.5% in the first half of 2013/2014, with an Adjusted EBITDA at €179.7 million in the first half of 2014/2015, as compared to €105.2 million in the first half of 2013/2014 (our (adjusted) EBITDA margin for the first half of a financial year is typically above the relevant margin for the full financial year). Of this increase in the first half of 2014/2015, €47.3 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business which was not part of our Group during the first half of 2013/2014. Excluding the effects from the Nocibé Business, our Adjusted EBITDA increased to €132.4 million in the first half of 2014/2015. Besides the above mentioned strategic and operative measures and initiatives implemented in particular in the financial year 2013/2014, a positive impact of synergies from the Nocibé Acquisition, as well as scale effects in our e-commerce business particularly positively impacted our significant margin expansion. We also expect that these effects and trends will further positively affect our profitability in the short to medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.10,Marketing and Customer Retention,17.10.1,,"We believe that driving customer loyalty and purchase frequency is critical to our growth and profitability. We employ a holistic promotion strategy across all channels and customer touch-points. On a gross basis, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in marketing which, in the periods under review, constituted the third largest share in our cost base. However, the largest portion of our annual gross marketing costs is financed by the third party brand suppliers of selective products in the form of so-called “market development funds.” These market development funds are funds that are made available by brand manufacturers to help us as a specialist selective retailer in selling their products and create local awareness about the manufacturers’ brand and are typically used in the selective beauty market. In our statements of income, market development funds are accounted for in other operating income as income from contributions of suppliers to marketing and advertising campaigns. In particular, marketing is becoming an increasingly important factor to promote customer loyalty and influences our sales. In response to this fact, we have a variety of customer retention programs. An important loyalty program is the Douglas Card with around 10 million card holders in 16 countries across Europe which offers certain benefits to the individual card holder, such as vouchers, special rebates or the Douglas magazine. A similar loyalty card program, the Nocibé card program, exists in France and Monaco with around 8 million card holders. In-store couponing is another tool used to promote customer loyalty and to activate customers by receiving a benefit coupon for a future purchase. Based on an analysis regarding sales via our German Douglas Card customers, we believe that loyalty card holders are particularly attractive customers, as the average ticket volume of our German Douglas Card customers grew significantly more in the past three financial years as compared to our German non-loyalty card customers. Furthermore, based on the same analysis, in the financial year 2013/2014, our German Douglas Card customers spend approximately 20% more per customer per purchase than our German non-loyalty card customers (as measured by sales at stationary stores).",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.11,"Seasonality, Working Capital and Inventory Management",17.11.1,,"Our product portfolio covers up to 35,000 different products and consists primarily of products with a relatively slow turnover rate and a highly seasonal demand. We experience major seasonal fluctuations in our sales with a significant portion of our sales typically being driven by key consumer events. Our most important trading period is typically the six week period leading up to Christmas and the New Year that ends on December 31 (which period falls into the first quarter of our financial year). With respect to the Douglas Perfumeries Business, in the last three financial years, our first quarter typically represented 30-40% of our total sales (while the remaining sales were relatively equally split between the last three quarters) and 4555% of our Adjusted EBITDA over the financial year (while we recorded the lowest Adjusted EBITDA contribution in the second quarter, with a relatively equal share of Adjusted EBITDA in the remaining two quarters). Thus, the financial information contained in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015, which already reflected the financial year’s Christmas business, is expected to account for a significant part of our sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the whole financial year 2014/2015. Our other important trading periods, varying ----- from country to country, are those around St. Valentine’s Day (in February), Easter (March or April, depending on the year) and Mother’s Day (in May or June, depending on the year or country). Also, our gross profit margin (defined as sales minus cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise) fluctuated significantly during the course of the year due to the formation and release of provision. Furthermore, our gross profit margin is affected by variation in pricing of products as there is no need for any promotions during our most profitable trading periods, whereas otherwise our gross profit margin is impacted by price reductions and other promotions. Our operating expenses are also affected by seasonal trading patterns, such as the increase in the use of temporary workers during the busiest trading periods. In addition, our net working capital also shows seasonal patterns, with investment in inventory generally reaching a peak in October and November while our trade payables, due to our general payment terms with suppliers, typically peak in December. The development of our net working capital is a key factor for our operating cash flow. We define net working capital as the sum of the sub-line items (i) inventories, (ii) trade accounts receivable, (iii) trade accounts payable, as well as (iv) other receivable and liabilities related to supplier receivables for rebates/bonuses and marketing subsidies (also see note 19 of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014), outstanding voucher liabilities, provisions for deliveries and services not yet invoiced (also see note 27 of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014). Our net working capital decreased significantly from €272.1 million as of September 30, 2012, to €235.9 million as of September 30, 2013 and €231.4 million as of September 30, 2014 (when excluding the impact of the Nocibé Business on our net working capital of €87.4 million as of September 30, 2014), mainly driven by a favorable change in payment dates for our trade accounts payable. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our net working capital ratio improved from 14.0% in the financial year 2011/2012, to 11.9% in the financial year 2012/2013 and 11.6% in the financial year 2013/2014 (all figures on a combined basis; figure for the financial year 2013/2014 excluding the effects of the Nocibé Business on our sales in the period July to September 2014 and our working capital as of September 30, 2014). Other than the above described seasonal fluctuation, our working capital remained relatively stable. This positive trend continued in the first half of 2014/2015, where our net working capital amounted to €263.9 million, or, expressed as a percentage of our sales in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, to 10.8%, whereby these sales accounted for the sales from the Nocibé Business only for the period from July 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, i.e., only for nine months. Also, we carefully manage our inventory with a strong focus on identifying the most relevant brands and maintaining an attractive overall inventory “age” profile. Thereby, we follow an approach strictly driven by our defined key performance indicators, tightly monitoring inventory turnover and out-of-stock products. We have implemented standardized processes for our product portfolio, product inventory, order and product liquidation planning and controlling. Our goal is to minimize the need for manual adjustments of our supply management and order process and rather operate with fully automated processes that require minimal human intervention. To this end, we first rolled out the demand forecast tool SAF by SAP, which enables the optimization of merchandise inventories in stores, in Germany in the financial year 2009/2010, and then subsequently in other countries, such as Switzerland and Austria in 2012, the Netherlands and Italy in 2013 and the first pilots in Poland in 2015. The SAF tool creates a general demand forecast (for up to 60 sales weeks), calculates the specific needs of all stores (including a security “buffer”) and prepares weekly centralized orders of goods for each supplier taking into consideration particularities such as compliance with minimum order quantities.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.12,Acquisitions and Joint Ventures,17.12.1,,"We have a track record of successfully executing acquisitions, including both large-scale acquisitions, such as the Nocibé Acquisition, as well as a number of smaller value accretive acquisitions of individual perfumeries or perfumery chains. For instance, in December 2014, we acquired Himmer, with five perfumeries in Munich, Germany and, in February 2015, Clin d’Oeil, with 43 perfumeries in France. The aggregated purchase price for these two acquisitions amounted to €27.8 million. The newly acquired stores contributed in total €4.6 million to our revenue in the first half of 2014/2015, with earnings before tax-contribution of €-0.1 million in the same period. Of the 43 perfumeries pertaining to Clin d’Oeil, seven perfumeries are required to be divested to comply with national and EU competition law. Through the Nocibé Acquisition in June 2014, we substantially strengthened our market position in Europe and in particular in France, where we now operate the largest perfumery chain with 496 directly operated stores and 137 franchised stores (as of March 31, 2015) and are the second largest retailer in the French beauty and cosmetic market in terms of sales for 2013 (based on sales for the financial year 2013/2014/sales for the calendar year 2013, but including an aggregation of our and Nocibé’s sales for such year, according to the OC&C Report; 13 directly operated and 25 franchised stores were to be sold in order for the Nocibé Acquisition to comply with national and EU competition law). ----- The Nocibé Acquisition and the amendments to our financing structure in connection therewith resulted in several significant effects in our income statement, statement of financial position and cash flow statements. The main effects are discussed under “—Presentation of Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum and Factors Affecting _Comparability—Factors Affecting Comparability of the Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum—The Nocibé Acquisition” and “Presentation of Selected Effects from the Nocibé Acquisition and the Separation of the Non- Acquired Business”._ While acquisitions of single stores or of beauty retailers (such as Nocibé) entail substantial capital expenditures or investments and lead to an overall increase of our fixed cost base, they also offer growth opportunities as well as the potential to save costs in the medium- to long-term through the realization of planned synergies and further economies of scale. We expect a mutual sharing of best practices of the Douglas Group and Nocibé Group to further enhance our competitiveness. While the Nocibé Group already had an efficient cost structure, it can benefit, for example, from Douglas’ experience in exclusive products. In addition, we believe that the integrated business will benefit in particular from economies of scale, including with respect to improved purchasing terms and conditions. In turn, the Douglas Group can benefit from the Nocibé Group’s expertise and experience relating to a centralized and efficient overhead management, as well as Nocibé Group’s experience in private label. In July 2012, we entered into a sourcing co-operation with Passion Beauté through the establishment of Douglas-Passion Beauté Achats S.A.S. (“DPB Achats”), an entity fully consolidated in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and our Audited Combined Financial Statements. In DPB Achats, we combined the sourcing for our French directly operated and franchised Douglas stores as well as for the store network of Passion Beauté, another French beauty retail chain. In the financial year 2011/2012, the business contributed sales, to our segment France in the amount of €20.5 million as it was only started in January 2012. In the financial year 2012/2013, it generated sales, in the amount of €45.0 million, which decreased to €38.4 million in the financial year 2013/2014 as a result of the reclassification of certain turnover to other operating income, which was previously accounted for under sales. In December 2014, we discontinued the co-operation due to such requirement of the competent cartel authorities. This termination will negatively impact the sales for our segment France but will have only a limited effect on our EBITDA as the business of DBP Achats as a procurement organization operated with a very small gross profit margin. In the first half of 2014/2015, DBP Achats contributed €17.6 million to our sales, whereas from the second half of the financial year to end on September 30, 2015 onwards DBP Achats will no longer contribute to our sales.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The Confectionery Business was sold to a third party with effect as of April 30, 2014. The Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business were sold and transferred to companies controlled by AI Beauty with effect as of October 1, 2014. Effective as of December 18, 2014, the Jewelry Business was sold and transferred to an international venture capital company. For further information on the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business, see “Material Acquisitions and _Divestitures—Divestiture of Non-Acquired Business”. Thus, we now exclusively focus on our core beauty and personal_ care business, where substantial operational improvement initiatives have been implemented in the past few years. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, the Non-Acquired Business was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5—“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” from October 1, 2013 to, with respect to the Confectionery Business, the effective date of the sale on April 30, 2014 and, with respect to the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business, the effective date of their separation on October 1, 2014. The Separation of the Non-Acquired Business, including the application of IFRS 5 and its deconsolidation, as well as certain amendments to the financing structure of the Group in connection with the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business had effects on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, which are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These effects related, in particular, to realized profits in connection with the sale of the Confectionery Business as well as to certain fully expensed adjustments resulting from the reclassification of the Books Business and the Fashion Business in accordance with IFRS 5—“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” in the financial year 2013/2014. Thus, in general terms, assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations were presented in a condensed form in separate lines “assets held for sale” and “liabilities held for sale” in the consolidated statements of financial position for the financial year 2013/2014, whereas these assets and liabilities were accounted for under the respective line items of our consolidated statements of financial position for the previous financial year. The earnings from the discontinued operations were presented separately in a condensed form as an additional line item of the consolidated income statements for the financial year 2013/2014 below earnings from continued operations and the net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing, and financing activities of the discontinued operations were also presented as a separate line item on the face of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the financial year ----- 2013/2014.

The sales attributable to the Non-Acquired Business totaled €1,232.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013. In the same period, the gross profit generated by the Non-Acquired Business amounted to €425.5 million, the EBITDA contribution of the Non-Acquired Business amounted to €-69.0 million, the EBIT contribution of the Non-Acquired Business amounted to €-109.2 million, the financial result of the Non-Acquired Business amounted to €-7.3 million, the earnings before tax-contribution of the Non-Acquired Business amounted to €-116.5 million and the profit or loss for the year related to the Non-Acquired Business amounted to €-94.0 million (all figures taken from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013).

The information contained in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015 is not fully comparable to the comparative figures for the previous financial year’s respective period due to the fact that (i) the Confectionery Business was sold to a third party with effect as of April 30, 2014 and was deconsolidated accordingly and the sales and transfers of the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business were accounted as the first booking entry on October 1, 2014 in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, whereas the comparative figures for the first half of 2013/2014 still accounted for the Non-Acquired Business which, in the statements of financial position, were fully consolidated, and, in the income statements and the statements of cash flows, were accounted for in a condensed form in accordance with IFRS 5—“Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”; and (ii) the comparative figures for the first half of 2013/2014 did not account for the Nocibé Group which at that time had not yet been acquired by the Douglas Group.

Our Audited Combined Financial Statements were audited by RBS, who issued for each financial year included therein an unqualified auditor’s report (uneingeschränkter Bestätigungsvermerk) thereon as included in this offering memorandum. The audit of our Audited Combined Financial Statements was conducted in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW, Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V.), which are compliant with ISA. ----- The Audited Combined Financial Statements were prepared to provide historical financial information of the Douglas Group (Douglas Holding AG and only such direct and indirect subsidiaries pertaining to the Douglas Perfumeries Business, as well as certain service entities and intermediate holdings, including two companies of the former Books Business and Fashion Business), as more fully described in note 1 (“Basis of preparation—Scope of the entities included in the Combined Financial Statements”) of our Audited Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum. Our Audited Combined Financial Statements also include the Nocibé business as from the time of the consolidation of the entities pertaining to the Nocibé Group, i.e., from July 1, 2014 until the cut-off date of the Audited Combined Financial Statements, September 30, 2014, but do not include the Company, Beauty Holding One GmbH or Beauty Holding Two GmbH (the direct and indirect parent companies of Douglas Holding AG) or, except for the two entities mentioned above, the entities relating to the Non-Acquired Business, within their scope. Costs from Holding Companies in the financial year 2012/2013 only reflected in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements but not in our Audited Combined Financial Statements include, in particular, administrative holding costs of €2.7 million, as well as financing costs relating to a bank loan of €20.7 million, and in the financial year 2013/2014, administrative holding costs of €1.7 million, as well as financing costs relating to shareholder loans and bank loans of €89.7 million. For the financial years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012, all of the entities of the Douglas Group (as defined for purposes of our Audited Combined Financial Statements) were under the common control of Douglas Holding AG. The diagram below shows those entities included within the scope of the Audited Combined Financial Statements: Our Audited Combined Financial Statements are the first financial statements of the Douglas Group, as described in note 1 of our Audited Combined Financial Statements, in accordance with IFRS 1.3. We prepared the Audited Combined Financial Statements using IFRS 1.D16 (a) (“predecessor accounting method”). We used the same accounting policies and valuation methods for the preparation of our Audited Combined Financial Statements, as those used for the preparation of the financial information included in historical consolidated financial statements of Douglas Holding AG, unless such accounting policies and valuation methods are not in accordance with IFRS when presenting the Douglas Group as a group of companies independent of Douglas Holding AG. These accounting policies have been disclosed under note 4 (“Accounting and valuation principles”) to our Audited Combined Financial Statements. Our Audited Combined Financial Statements were prepared on a historical cost basis according to the current accounting policies of Douglas Holding AG as included in the historical consolidated financial statements of such company, based on Douglas Holding AG’s date of transition to IFRS (October 1, 2004). Since IFRS does not provide any guidance for the preparation of combined financial statements, IAS 8.12 has been used, which requires that the latest pronouncements of other standard setters, other accounting literature and accepted industry practice should be considered. Our Audited Combined Financial Statements have been derived from the aggregation of the net assets of Douglas Holding AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as described in note 1 of our Audited Combined Financial Statements. All intra-group balances, income, expenses and unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions between Douglas Holding AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries were eliminated when preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements. Due to the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements, the presentation of equity for the Group differs from the presentation of equity as prescribed by IAS 1. “Invested equity” contains subscribed share capital and the cumulative retained earnings of the Douglas Holding AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The invested equity also includes undistributed profits of companies comprising the combined Group as well as the components of other comprehensive income. Investments of the holding companies in the Douglas Group were eliminated against the equity of the respective subsidiaries. In addition, investments of the Douglas Group in companies relating to the Non ----- Acquired Business were eliminated against equity of the Douglas Group. Dividend distributions and transfers of profit and loss subject to profit and loss transfer agreements are presented as other changes in equity similar to contributions of capital or withdrawals of capital respectively. In the combined cash flow statement such transactions are presented as proceeds or repayments of equity within cash flow from financing activities. Income taxes were determined based on the assumption that the companies of the Douglas Group were separately taxable entities. This assumption implies that the current and deferred income taxes of all companies and of the tax groups within the Douglas Group were calculated separately and the recoverability of the deferred tax assets was also assessed accordingly for the financial years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. In the financial year 2013/2014, the introduction of a new profit and loss transfer agreement for the formation of a new tax group, in which the Company is the tax group parent, caused a structure in which Douglas Holding AG becomes an interim tax group entity. The implication of this structure was that the allocation of income and deferred taxes was performed according to the group allocation method. This caused a systematic allocation of income and deferred taxes of the tax group parent to each tax group entity. Due to the fact that certain entities of the Douglas Group did not file separate tax returns in previous years, the respective current tax assets and liabilities, as well as the deferred tax assets on net operating losses, are deemed either contributed or distributed to the respective tax group member filing the tax return with a corresponding effect in the equity of the (non-Douglas Group) shareholder as of the end of the respective period. The taxes actually paid by the Douglas Group have been presented in our combined statements of cash flows; the deemed contributions or distributions have not been included. In financial year 2013/2014, all companies of Douglas Group were either separately taxable entities or were part of an income tax group within Douglas Group. Receivables and payables between Douglas Holding AG and Beauty Holding Two GmbH and the Holding Companies arising from the VAT group have been disclosed under other tax receivables and payables, respectively. Management considers the separate tax return approach to be reasonable, but not necessarily indicative of the tax income or expense that would have been incurred if the entities were indeed separate taxable entities. Furthermore, for the preparation of our Audited Combined Financial Statements, it was necessary to make assumptions and estimates for adjustments relating to the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business that have an impact on assets and liabilities, as well as on income and expenses. Accordingly, our Audited Combined Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect the net assets, financial position and results of operations that would have been presented if the Douglas Group, as described in note 1 of our Audited Combined Financial Statements, had already existed during the periods presented. However, we believe that the operational business of the Acquired Business remained materially unchanged between the periods before the First Douglas Acquisition and the periods thereafter, with the exception of the Nocibé Acquisition. Our Audited Combined Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the future development of the business. For further information on the preparation of our Audited Combined Financial Statements, including the determination of income taxes and several assumptions and estimates made in preparing our Audited Combined Financial Statements, see note 1 (“Basis of preparation”) to our Audited Combined Financial Statements included in offering memorandum. For information on the first-time application of certain IAS standards, see note 2 to our Audited Combined Financial Statements, included in this offering memorandum. Our Audited Combined Financial Statements are included in this offering memorandum and are also discussed below. _Audited Consolidated Financial Statements_ Our Group’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared by the Company—which was established on August 14, 2012 but only commenced its operating activities in December 2012—as of and for the financial years 2013/2014 and 2012/2013, respectively (including comparative figures for the respective previous financial year) in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union. Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements were audited by RBS, who issued for each financial year an unqualified auditor’s report (uneingeschränkter _Bestätigungsvermerk) thereon. The audit of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements was conducted in accordance_ with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW, Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V.), which are compliant with International Standards on Auditing (“ISA”). The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are included in this offering memorandum. ----- _Financial and Business Information of the Nocibé Group_ Financial information relating to the Nocibé Group as of and for the short financial year beginning January 1, 2014 and ended September 30, 2014, and as of and for the financial years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 contained in this offering memorandum is based on the Nocibé Consolidated Financial Statements of Groupe Nocibé SAS prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as of and for the short financial year ended September 30, 2014 (with comparative figures as of and for the financial years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012). The Nocibé Consolidated Financial Statements were each jointly audited by Groupe Nocibé SAS’s statutory auditors, Constantin Associés (a member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited) and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, who issued in each case an unqualified auditor’s report thereon as included in this offering memorandum. They include Groupe Nocibé SAS and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, which together represent the “Nocibé Business.” The Nocibé Consolidated Financial Statements are included in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Because of such effects, the financial information as presented in the different sets of financial statements included in this offering memorandum may not be fully comparable. _The First Douglas Acquisition_ The First Douglas Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3—“Business Combinations.” The application of purchase accounting under IFRS (purchase price allocation, “PPA”), as well as a reorganization of the financing of our Group following the First Douglas Acquisition had an effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In particular, in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013 the recognition and valuation effects from the PPA in relation to the First Douglas Acquisition as of December 1, 2012 totaled €905.3 million, of which €687.5 million pertained to the Acquired Business. Of this amount pertaining to the Acquired Business, €488.2 million related to brands, €37.7 million related to customer relationships and €10.3 million related to beneficial tenancy agreements, all of which were recognized within intangible assets, €105.7 million related to inventories as well as €4.9 million related to properties. After recognition of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €207.0 million, a remaining amount of €247.7 million was recorded as goodwill in the financial year 2012/2013. The following tables show the step-ups between book value and fair value as a result of the PPA in relation to the First Douglas Acquisition as of the dates indicated as well as the effects on the consolidated income statement before taxes for the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

As a consequence the amounts indicated may increase due to impairment charges which are to be expensed when incurred. Furthermore, in relation to the First Douglas Acquisition as well as the squeeze-out in May 2013 and the delisting in August 2013, as based on our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013, costs increased by €18.7 million due to considerable extraordinary personnel expenses of €3.7 million and to other operating expenses of €17.5 million, while we recorded extraordinary other operating income related thereto of €2.5 million. Also, the sale of inventories in the normal course of business during the financial year 2012/2013 led to a decline in gross profit (defined as the difference between sales and cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise) by €105.7 million and an EBITDA charge of the same amount in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013. The PPA effects resulting from the First Douglas Acquisition, as described above, also cause comparability issues relating to our Audited Consolidated Statements mainly because of the inventory step-up in the amount of €105.7 million, which was fully expensed in the financial year 2012/2013, against no such expenses in the following financial year, and the fact that amortization and taxation effects were only considered for ten months in the financial year 2012/2013 and for a full year in the financial year 2013/2014. In addition, also based on our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2012/2013, our financial result for the financial year 2012/2013 was negatively impacted by higher financial expenses due to a higher level of borrowings, as well as increased credit margins from the financing agreements entered into by Beauty Holding Three AG (which, effective as of February 20, 2013, was merged as the transferring entity upstream into Beauty Holding Two GmbH as the absorbing entity) in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition. In order to finance the takeover offer submitted by Beauty Holding Three AG (later merged into Beauty Holding Two AG, which was then transformed into a German limited liability company) and the following steps related to the First Douglas Acquisition, a senior facilities agreement (“SFA”) was entered by into by Beauty Holding Two GmbH with a banking syndicate on October 15, 2012, including a senior syndicated loan for originally €650 million (thereof €138.5 million paid to Beauty Holding Two GmbH and €61.5 million to Douglas Holding AG as “term loan a” and €311.5 million to Beauty Holding Two GmbH and €138.5 million to Douglas Finance B.V. as “term loan b”), and a mezzanine facility agreement (“MFA”) relating to a mezzanine syndicated loan for €200 million (see also “Material Acquisitions and _Divestitures—Financing Agreements”). The then existing financial agreements of Douglas Holding AG were redeemed._ Douglas Holding AG became a party to the SFA and the MFA on October 17, 2012 to ensure the refinancing of the existing debt, whereas the debt push down was not implemented until the financial year 2013/2014. In addition, a revolving credit facility of €180.0 million granted to Beauty Holding Two GmbH was in place. Furthermore, a shareholder loan of €280.2 million was granted to Beauty Holding One GmbH by the AI Beauty Finance S.à r.l. In connection with these financing measures, a total disagio of €49.7 million was assumed and a redemption fee of €1.0 million incurred. Debt discounts were amortized over the term of the loan. Most effects of the First Douglas Acquisition are not reflected in our Audited Combined Financial Statements, but in our Consolidated Financial Statements and our Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. However, transaction costs in relation to the First Douglas Acquisition were in part incurred by entities of the Douglas Perfumeries Business and, thus, were accounted for in our Audited Combined Financial Statements, and in part incurred by the Holding Companies and, in this respect were accounted for only in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Audited Combined Financial Statements did not include the Holding Companies. Furthermore, certain effects from the refinancing of the Douglas Group in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, as well as from the subsequent debt push down were reflected in our Audited Combined Financial Statements to the extent that these effects affected entities within the scope of our Audited Combined Financial Statements. ----- _The Nocibé Acquisition_ The Nocibé Acquisition, with effect for accounting purposes as of July 1, 2014, was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3—“Business Combinations”. The application of purchase accounting under IFRS and the amendments to the financing structure of the Group in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition had an effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The purchase price amounted to €165.2 million and was fully paid in cash. The recognition and valuation effects from the PPA in relation to the Nocibé Acquisition amounted to €401.0 million in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and our Audited Combined Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, both as of June 1, 2014. Thereof, €139.6 million related to the Nocibé brand, €17.5 million related to the customer base and €1.6 million related to beneficial tenancy agreements and €-0.2 million as deposits, all of which were recognized within intangible assets. €32.4 million related to the disclosure of hidden reserves regarding inventories. After recognition of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €67.7 million, a remaining amount of €277.8 million was recorded as goodwill. The following tables show the step-ups between book value and fair value as a result of the PPA in relation to the Nocibé Acquisition as of the dates indicated as well as the effects on the consolidated income statement before taxes for the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Effective as of December 20, 2013, the loan amount of a syndicated loan was extended by a further tranche in the amount of €275.0 million, mainly to allow for the acquisition of the Nocibé Group, and a partial amount of the original debt (€47.0 million) was redeemed. The SFA and the MFA were both amended and restated on several occasions, most recently on September 26, 2014, in order to adapt the financing structure to the new group structure including the acquired Nocibé companies. Furthermore, the initial financing of the Nocibé Group has been replaced. For further information, see note 3 (Principles of Consolidation) to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 15 (Business Combinations) to our Audited Combined Financial Statements, both included in this offering memorandum. In addition, certain assets of selected directly operated retail stores in France mainly relating to shop installation in the amount of €1.7 million were accounted for as assets held for sale in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and our Audited Combined Financial Statements for the financial year 2013/2014, as these retail stores were to be sold in order for the Nocibé Acquisition to comply with national and EU competition law. ----- In the first half of 2014/2015, the PPA in relation to the Nocibé Acquisition has impacted our results of operation through increased cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise in the amount of €24.3 million and increased amortization/depreciation of €1.9 million. Because the effective date of the Nocibé Acquisition for accounting purposes was July 1, 2014, our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Audited Combined Financial Statements reflected the Nocibé Acquisition only as from this date. Therefore, financial information for the financial year 2013/2014 based on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Audited Combined Financial Statements does not include the Nocibé Business for the period October 1, 2013 to July 1, 2014 and, thus, the important Christmas period (for further details on the seasonality of our business see “—Selected Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Position—Seasonality, Working Capital _and Inventory Management”). Transaction costs and financing costs in relation to the Nocibé Acquisition were in part_ incurred by entities of the Douglas Perfumeries Business and, thus, were accounted for in our Audited Combined Financial Statements, and in part incurred by the Holding Companies and, in this respect, were accounted for only in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Audited Combined Financial Statements did not include the Holding Companies. Furthermore, regarding financial information based on our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015, the respective comparative period—October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014—does not include effects from the Nocibé Business, whereas the Nocibé Business is fully reflected in the first half of 2014/2015. In order to enable investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the aforementioned periods, the discussion of certain line items included below includes wherever possible a calculation of the effect attributable to the Nocibé Business. _The Separation of the Non-Acquired Business_ After the First Douglas Acquisition, we initiated comprehensive measures for a strategic reorganization and realignment of the Douglas Group with the objective of concentrating our operating activities on our core business relating to beauty and care products, namely the Acquired Business. The Confectionery Business was sold to a third party with effect as of April 30, 2014, and the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business were sold and transferred to companies controlled by AI Beauty with effect as of October 1, 2014. Effective as of December 18, 2014, the Jewelry Business was transferred to an international venture capital company. The Separation of the Non-Acquired Business, including the application of IFRS 5 and its deconsolidation, as well as certain amendments to the financing structure of the Group in connection with the Separation of the NonAcquired Business had effects on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, which were not reflected in our Audited Combined Financial Statements but only in our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, transaction costs in relation to the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business were in part incurred by entities of the Douglas Perfumeries Business and, thus, were accounted for in our Audited Combined Financial Statements and in part incurred by the Holding Companies and, in this respect, were accounted for only in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, whereby in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business which were accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 were separated as the first booking entry on October 1, 2014 and were deconsolidated on that date.

The operational activities of the Nocibé Business affected, inter alia, our combined income statements and combined statements of financial position. Those effects are shown here, however, excluding transaction costs relating to the Nocibé Acquisition which were primarily reflected in other operating expenses as extraordinary expenses and which were adjusted for in our Adjusted EBITDA (see “—Results of Operations for the Financial Years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012 (Combined)—EBITDA”). 2 The Nocibé Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3—“Business Combinations”. The PPA relating to the Nocibé Acquisition affected, inter _alia, our combined income statements and combined statements of financial position. Those effects are shown here._ 3 The sales attributable to the Nocibé Business of €111.6 million included intercompany sales with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in the amount of €10.4 million and cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise relating to the Nocibé Business include the corresponding cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise both of which related to sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions of the Nocibé Business with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France, which were eliminated on consolidation. 4 EBITDA (calculated as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses and plus income from other investments) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA as shown in the table above is unadjusted. 5 Adjusted EBITDA comprises reported EBITDA, adjusted for exceptional items. Exceptional items related to (i) consulting fees, in the financial year 2012/2013 in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, including consulting fees in relation to the squeeze-out in May 2013 and the delisting in August 2013, as well as, in the financial year 2013/2014 in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business and the implementation of certain efficiency measures, (ii) restructuring costs, primarily relating to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and severance payments, (iii) effects from PPA related, in the financial year 2013/2014, to the Nocibé Acquisition and (iv) other exceptional items including, in the financial year 2013/2014, in particular one-off inventory revaluations, synergy bonuses for Nocibé’s management, property tax payments related to a corporate restructuring, as well as rent increases in Austria against which we entered an objection. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define Adjusted EBITDA in the same way, Adjusted EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 6 Impairment losses related to impairment tests in cash generating units and are triggered by ongoing negative contribution and intended store closures. Individual stationary stores each represent a cash generating unit. 7 EBIT (calculated as EBITDA minus amortization/depreciation) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBIT should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBIT in the same way, EBIT as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures used by other companies. EBIT as shown in the table above is unadjusted. 8 Due to the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Douglas Group for the financial years 2013/2014, 2012/2013 and 2011/2012, the Douglas Group’s equity for these periods is presented on a combined group structure and contains “Net assets attributable to the shareholders of the Douglas Group” deducted by other comprehensive income components and “Other components of equity attributable to the shareholders of the Douglas Group”. 9 “Net assets of Douglas Group” are defined as the remainder of assets and liabilities as at balance sheet date. 10 “Other components of equity attributable to the shareholders of the Douglas Group” are defined as other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS. 11 In the financial year 2013/2014, a debt push down (including the assumption of bank loans by Douglas Holding AG and Parfümerie Douglas GmbH from Beauty Holding Two GmbH) was implemented affecting, in particular, the non-current and current financial liabilities as shown in our Audited Combined Financial Statements.

As a result, our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements first half of 2014/2015 only account for the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business with respect to this first booking entry, and not at all with respect to the Confectionery Business, while our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2013/2014 still account for the Non-Acquired Business for the whole period, i.e. from October 1, 2013 until March 31, 2014, whereas the comparative figures for the first half of 2013/2014 regarding the income statements and the statements of cash flows (but not the statements of financial position) were adjusted according to IFRS 5, the effects of which are shown here. 2 With effect for accounting purposes as of July 1, 2014, we acquired the Nocibé Group. The operational activities of the Nocibé Business affected, inter alia, our consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of financial position. Those effects are shown here. 3 The Nocibé Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 – “Business Combinations”.

Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA as shown in the table above is unadjusted. 6 Adjusted EBITDA comprises reported EBITDA, adjusted for exceptional items. Exceptional items in the first half of 2014/2015 related to (i) PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, (ii) consulting fees mainly in connection with the Company in sale process and the Nocibé Acquisition as well as consulting fees in connection with the acquisition of Clin d’Oeil and the sales and transfers of the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business effective as of October 1, 2014, (iii) restructuring costs from the recognition of a provision with respect to certain litigations in Austria and severance payments and (iv) other exceptional items which mainly related to rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. In the financial year 2014/2015, the Austrian Supreme Court found that the taking private of the Douglas Group constituted a change of control within the means of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law (Mietrechtsgesetz) and rejected the argument that the act violates the freedom of establishment (Niederlassungsfreiheit) and the freedom of movement of capital (Kapitalverkehrsfreiheit) under the European Union Treaty. Thus, rent increases in the amount of €1.3 million which were adjusted in the financial year 2013/2014 as extraordinary effects, must be classified from now on as recurring effects and consequently may not be adjusted from the financial year 2014/2015 onwards which has been reflected in our Unconsolidated Financial Statements for the first half of 2014/2015. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the combined or consolidated income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS.

For the purposes of segment reporting, the individual countries in which Douglas operates are allocated to the regions Germany (including as of October 30, 2014, Norway), France (including Monaco), South-western Europe (including Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland) and Eastern Europe (including Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Turkey). Service and regional holding entities are allocated to the segments based on the region of their place of business. Transfers between our segments are conducted on an arm’s length basis. Segment sales (net) reflect the sales generated with third parties outside the Douglas Group while intersegment sales reflect any sales between our four regional segments. The key segmental performance indicators are Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. EBITDA and net income are adjusted for either non-recurring or one-off items or impacts limited to a certain period of time. Non-recurring and one-off items include, but are not limited to, consulting fees, restructuring costs, extraordinary financing costs such as fees, costs incurred from the integration of the Nocibé Group and other extraordinary costs. Furthermore, net income is adjusted for impairment losses and, since the first half of 2014/2015, tax effects on the aforementioned adjustments. Segment inventory comprises finished goods and merchandise, raw materials, consumables and supplies as well as advances to suppliers for merchandise.

For further details see “—Presentation of Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum and Factors Affecting _Comparability—Presentation of the Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum—Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”._ 2 Data excluding the Nocibé Business (which at the time had not yet been acquired by the Douglas Group) and the Non-Acquired Business. For further details, see “—Presentation of Financial Information Used in this Offering Memorandum and Factors Affecting Comparability—Presentation of the Financial _Information Used in this Offering Memorandum—Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”._ In the first half of 2014/2015, our EBITDA increased by €51.3 million, or 57.3%, to €140.8 million from €89.5 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Of this increase in EBITDA, €45.9 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business, which was not yet part of the Douglas Group in the first half of 2013/2014, but was included in the first half of 2014/2015. However, this contribution was partly offset by the negative impact in the amount of €24.3 million from PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition relating to the sale of inventories in the normal course of business during the first half of 2014/2015 which was recognized in cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise. ----- Other than the effect attributable to the Nocibé Business, the remaining increase of €5.4 million mainly resulted from the numerous efficiency measures which we have implemented particularly in the financial year 2013/2014 and of which further effects materialized in the first half of 2014/2015, thereby in particular positively impacting our personnel expenses margin, as well as our other operating expenses margin. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our EBITDA improved from 8.1% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 9.7% in the first half of 2014/2015, particularly driven by the strong increase in our sales, higher EBITDA margins of the Nocibé Business (due to efficient cost management of the Nocibé Group), as well as efficiency savings on personnel expenses and other operating expenses as a result of the multiple operational and strategic initiatives we have implemented, in particular, in the financial year 2013/2014. Our Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) increased by €74.5 million, or 70.8%, to €179.7 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €105.2 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Adjustments totaled €38.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015 and related primarily to extraordinary costs of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise from PPA step-ups in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition of €24.3 million related to the sale of inventories in the normal course of business during the first half of 2014/2015. In addition, further exceptional items in the first half of 2014/2015 related to consulting fees mainly in connection with the proposed sale or IPO processes and the Nocibé Acquisition as well as consulting fees in connection with the acquisition of Clin d’Oeil, the sales and transfers of the Books Business, the Jewelry Business and the Fashion Business effective as of October 1, 2014, restructuring costs from the recognition of a provision with respect to certain legal disputes and severance payments and other exceptional items which mainly related to rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. In comparison, in the first half of 2013/2014, adjustments totaled €15.7 million and related primarily to restructuring costs of €6.1 million and consulting fees of €5.5 million attributable to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and to severance payments with respect to efficiency improvements in our German store portfolio. The remaining exceptional items in the first half of 2013/2014 of €4.1 million related primarily to rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection. In the financial year 2014/2015, the Austrian Supreme Court found that the taking private of the Douglas Group constituted a change of control within the means of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law (Mietrechtsgesetz) and rejected the argument that the act violates the freedom of establishment (Niederlassungsfreiheit) and the freedom of movement of capital (Kapitalverkehrsfreiheit) under the European Union Treaty. Thus, rent increases in the amount of €1.3 million which were adjusted in the financial year 2013/2014 as extraordinary effects, must be classified from now on as recurring effects and consequently may not be adjusted from the financial year 2014/2015 onwards. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our Adjusted EBITDA improved from 9.5% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 12.4% in the first half of 2014/2015. On a segment level, EBITDA of our German segment increased by €26.4 million, or 51.8%, to €77.4 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €51.0 million in the first half of 2013/2014. This increase in EBITDA was partly due to significant scale benefits realized in Germany, in particular in light of our growing e-commerce business. Furthermore, positive effects from the centralization of our purchasing functions, our improved assortment management process, product mix effects (especially a higher sales share of private label products), as well as personnel efficiencies across our German store portfolio positively impacted the EBITDA of our German segment. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), the EBITDA of our German segment increased from 8.3% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 12.0% in the first half of 2014/2015. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our German segment increased by €19.2 million, or 29.4%, to €84.4 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €65.2 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Adjustments relating to our German segment in the first half of 2014/2015 totaled €7.0 million and related primarily to consulting fees in connection with the proposed sale or IPO processes and costs related to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and improving efficiency across our German store portfolio, whereas in the first half of 2013/2014 adjustments totaled €14.2 million and related primarily to consulting fees, severance payments and other restructuring costs related to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and improving personnel efficiency across our German store portfolio, consulting fees related to the sale of our Jewelry and Confectionery Business, as well as follow-on costs in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our German segment improved from 10.6% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 13.1% in the first half of 2014/2015 mainly due to further positive effects from purchasing centralization, active assortment management, strong sales efficiencies achieved following our store headcount reduction program in the financial year 2013/2014 and the higher scalability of our e-commerce business. ----- EBITDA of our French segment increased by €22.3 million to €28.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €6.6 million in the first half of 2013/2014. In the first half of 2014/2015, the Nocibé Business, which was not yet part of our Group in the first half of 2013/2014, contributed EBITDA of €45.9 million to our French segment. The remaining decrease of €23.6 million was mainly due to exceptional PPA effects of €24.3 million in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, as well as the streamlining of our product range, including the sell-off of private label products of the French Douglas Perfumeries Business in connection with the rebranding of the French stores pertaining to this business as Nocibé stores. Despite these negative effects, the EBITDA of our French segment, expressed as a percentage of sales (net), increased from 6.4% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 7.2% in the first half of 2014/2015, mainly due to increased economies of scale of our French business, as well as the positive impact resulting from a higher EBITDA at Nocibé. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our French segment increased by €52.1 million to €58.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €6.8 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Adjustments relating to our French segment in the first half of 2014/2015 totaled €30.0 million and related primarily to PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, whereas in the first half of 2013/2014 adjustments totaled €0.2 million. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our segment France increased from 6.6% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 14.6% in the first half of 2014/2015 mainly due to Nocibé’s higher profitability when compared to the French Douglas Perfumeries Business. EBITDA of our South-western Europe segment increased by €1.1 million, or 5.6%, to €20.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €19.8 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), the EBITDA of our South-western Europe segment improved from 7.3% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 7.6% in the first half of 2014/2015. This increase was mainly a result of the significant actions we have implemented in the last two financial years, thereby improving the structural profitability of this segment across all relevant countries. These actions included a significant store portfolio restructuring in Spain and Italy, with the closure of more than 20 stores across those countries, a strengthening of regional leadership and management (including putting a new management team in place), enhanced in-store selling efforts, a more favorable product mix effect resulting from a higher sales share of private label products, improved purchasing terms achieved through our group-wide purchasing program, as well as improved personnel efficiency across our store portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our South-western Europe segment increased by €1.7 million, or 8.0%, to €22.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €21.2 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Adjustments relating to our South-western Europe segment in the first half of 2014/2015 totaled €2.0 million and related primarily to the recognition of provisions in connection with certain legal disputes in Austria, whereas in the first half of 2013/2014 adjustments totaled €1.4 million and related primarily to rent increases in Austria against which we have entered an objection, which must be classified as recurring effects in light of the above described decision of the Austrian Supreme Court in the financial year 2014/2015. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our South-western Europe segment improved from 7.9% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 8.5% in the first half of 2014/2015, mainly as a result of the significant actions we have taken and implemented over the financial years 2013/2014 and 2012/2013. EBITDA of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €1.5 million, or 12.4%, to €13.6 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €12.1 million in the first half of 2013/2014. The main reasons for this improvement were the continued sales growth in this segment due to the continued expansion of our store network and increased e-commerce sales, as well as gradual margin improvements mainly driven by our group-wide and certain segment-specific measures. These measures included improved purchasing terms achieved through our group-wide purchasing program, including increasing volume rebates, a more favorable product mix, particularly through a higher sales share of private label products, an improved fixed costs coverage with respect to our e-commerce business, as well as overhead savings which offset higher marketing expenses in this segment. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), the EBITDA of our Eastern Europe segment improved from 9.8% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 10.4% in the first half of 2014/2015. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €1.5 million, or 12.5%, to €13.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €12.0 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Adjustments relating to our Eastern Europe segment totaled €-0.1 million in each of the first half of 2014/2015 and the first half of 2013/2014. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our Eastern Europe segment improved from 9.7% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 10.3% in the first half of 2014/2015, mainly driven by the above mentioned efficiency improvements and economies of scale due to higher sales.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The Nocibé Business, which was not part of the Douglas Group in the financial year 2012/2013, but was included in the financial year 2013/2014 for the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014, contributed €6.3 million to our EBITDA in the financial year 2013/2014. This contribution was, however, overcompensated by the negative impact in the amount of €8.1 million from PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition relating to the sale of inventories in the normal course of business during the financial year 2012/2013 which was recognized in cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise. Furthermore, as the Nocibé Business was accounted for only for ----- the period from July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014, the Christmas business of the Nocibé Business which similarly to the Christmas Business of the Douglas Perfumeries Business typically features particularly strong EBITDA contributions was not accounted for in the financial year 2013/2014. Regarding the remaining effect of a decrease in the amount of €35.7 million in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared to the prior financial year, our EBITDA was negatively affected mainly by extraordinary effects relating to severance payments and consulting fees which were recognized in personnel expenses and other operating expenses, as described above. Our Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) increased by €18.8 million, or 10.4%, to €199.5 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €180.7 million in the financial year 2012/2013. Of this increase, €6.3 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business which was not part of the Douglas Group in the financial year 2012/2013, but was included in the financial year 2013/2014 for the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Adjustments totaled €72.7 million in the financial year 2013/2014 and related primarily to consulting fees in the amount of €37.2 million, €15.8 million thereof relating to the Nocibé Acquisition. Further extraordinary effects in the financial year 2013/2014 included restructuring costs of €19.3 million, primarily relating to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and severance payments in part related to the elimination of redundancies subsequent to the Nocibé Acquisition. Additional extraordinary effects resulted from PPA in the amount of €8.1 million in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition. Other exceptional items amounted to €8.0 million and in particular comprised one-off inventory revaluations, synergy bonuses for Nocibé’s management, property tax payments related to a corporate restructuring, as well as rent increases in the amount of €2.0 million in Austria against which we entered an objection. In the financial year 2014/2015, the Austrian Supreme Court held that the taking private of the Douglas Group constituted a change of control within the means of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law (Mietrechtsgesetz) and rejected the argument that the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law violates the freedom of establishment (Niederlassungsfreiheit) and the freedom of movement of capital (Kapitalverkehrsfreiheit) under the European Union Treaty. Thus, rent increases in the amount of €1.3 million which were adjusted in the financial year 2013/2014 as extraordinary effects, must be classified from now on as recurring effects and consequently may not be adjusted from the financial year 2014/2015 onwards. In the financial year 2012/2013, adjustments totaled €16.4 million and related primarily to consulting fees (including legal and tax advisory fees) in the amount of €8.8 million relating to First Douglas Acquisition, including consulting fees in relation to the squeeze-out in May 2013 and the delisting in August 2013, and restructuring costs in the amount of €4.9 million (including severance payments and costs for the closure of stores) as well as other exceptional items in the amount of €2.5 million (including the above described adjustments with respect to rent increases in the amount of €1.5 million of which €0.9 million must be classified as recurring effects in light of the above described decision of the Austrian Supreme Court in the financial year 2014/2015 and including certain legal costs and provisions for impending losses related to subleases). Expressed as a percentage of sales, our Adjusted EBITDA increased from 9.1% in the financial year 2012/2013 to 9.5% in the financial year 2013/2014 resulting from the implementation of the various above described cost efficiency measures. On a segment level, EBITDA of our German segment decreased by €16.6 million, or 15.3%, to €91.9 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €108.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013. The main reason for this development was a decrease in other operating income and an increase of personnel expenses mainly due to restructuring costs relating to the above described implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and improving efficiency across our store portfolio, as well as severance payments relating to the elimination of redundancies due to the Nocibé Acquisition and downsizing of overhead personnel with respect to efficiency measures. However, our Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our German segment increased by €8.5 million, or 6.8%, to €133.0 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €124.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013. Adjustments relating to our German segment in the financial year 2013/2014 totaled €41.1 million and related primarily to consulting fees, severance payments and other restructuring costs related to the implementation of certain efficiency measures with a view to further optimizing our overhead costs and improving efficiency across our German store portfolio, consulting fees related to the sale of our Jewelry and Confectionery Business, as well as follow-on costs in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, whereas in the financial year 2012/2013 adjustments totaled €16.0 million and related primarily to consulting fees and other costs relating to the First Douglas Acquisition. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our German segment increased from 11.4% in the financial year 2012/2013 to 11.9% in the financial year 2013/2014 mainly due to positive effects from purchasing centralization, active assortment management, strong sales efficiencies achieved ----- following a store headcount reduction program in the financial year 2013/2014 and higher scalability of our e-commerce business. EBITDA of our French segment decreased by €23.3 million to €-14.6 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €8.7 million in the financial year 2012/2013. Of this decrease, €1.8 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business (including PPA effects) which was included in the financial year 2013/2014 for the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Regarding the remaining effect of €21.3 million, the main reason for the decrease related to transaction costs in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition and the above described streamlining of our product range and sell-off of private label products in connection with the rebranding of our French stores pertaining to the Douglas Perfumeries Business as Nocibé stores. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our French segment increased by €6.0 million, or 68.2%, to €14.8 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €8.8 million in the financial year 2012/2013. Adjustments relating to our French segment in the financial year 2013/2014 totaled €29.4 million and related primarily to consulting fees in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition, whereas in the financial year 2012/2013 adjustments totaled €0.1 million and related primarily to bad debt provisions. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our French segment improved from 4.9% in the financial year 2012/2013 to 5.4% in the financial year 2013/2014 mainly due to the increased scale of our French business as well as Nocibé’s higher profitability as compared to the French Douglas Perfumeries Business. EBITDA of our South-western Europe segment decreased by €0.7 million, or 2.1%, to €32.6 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €33.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013 which was in line with the decrease in sales (net) of our South-western Europe segment as described above. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our South-western Europe segment increased by €1.5 million, or 4.5%, to €35.0 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €33.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013. Adjustments relating to our South-western Europe segment in the financial year 2013/2014 totaled €2.4 million (including the above mentioned adjustments with respect to rent increases in the amount of €1.5 million of which €0.9 million must be classified as recurring effects in light of the above described decision of the Austrian Supreme Court in the financial year 2014/2015) and €0.2 million in the financial year 2012/2013, respectively, and in each case related primarily to bad debt provisions. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our South-western Europe segment increased from 6.6% in the financial year 2012/2013 to 7.2% in the financial year 2013/2014 mainly due to the effects from the implementation of the above described store closure program, enhanced in-store selling efforts, change in product mix more tailored to local markets, purchasing savings through a group-wide program and a store staff efficiency program. EBITDA of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €3.1 million, or 21.0%, to €16.9 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €13.8 million in the financial year 2012/2013. The main reason for this development was an improved business performance in Poland. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €2.8 million, or 20.1%, to €16.7 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €13.9 million in the financial year 2012/2013.

Our Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) increased by €7.5 million, or 4.3%, to €180.7 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €173.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012. Adjustments totaled €16.4 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and related primarily to consulting fees and restructuring costs as described above, whereas in the financial year 2011/2012 adjustments totaled €3.5 million and related primarily to consulting fees in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, most of which were attributable to other services relating to consulting fees (including fees for legal and tax advice). The remaining part of the adjustments in financial year 2012/2013 related primarily to severance payments. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our Adjusted EBITDA increased from 8.9% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 9.1% in the financial year 2012/2013. On a segment level, EBITDA of our German segment decreased by €1.2 million, or 1.1%, to €108.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €109.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this ----- development was the increase of consulting fees for transaction related costs and follow-on costs relating to the First Douglas Acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our German segment increased by €12.8 million, or 11.5%, to €124.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €111.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012. Adjustments relating to our German segment in the financial year 2012/2013 totaled €16.0 million and related primarily to consulting fees and restructuring costs as described above, whereas in the financial year 2011/2012 adjustments totaled €2.0 million and related primarily to consulting fees in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our German segment improved from 10.4% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 11.4% in the financial year 2012/2013, resulting mainly from the optimization of our German store portfolio and the continuous centralization and systematization of functions such as assortment planning, procurement, pricing and campaigning, as well as through the improvement of support and administrative processes. EBITDA of our French segment increased by €0.5 million, or 6.1%, to €8.7 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €8.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012 due to the factors described above. The Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for non-recurring and extraordinary effects) of our French segment increased by €0.6 million, or 7.3%, to €8.8 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €8.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012. Adjustments relating to our French segment in the financial year 2012/2013 totaled €0.1 million and related primarily to bad debt provisions, whereas in the financial year 2011/2012 adjustments totaled €0 million as there were no material extraordinary effects in that financial year relating to our French business. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our French segment decreased from 5.3% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 4.9% in the financial year 2012/2013. EBITDA of our South-western Europe segment decreased by €5.9 million, or 15.1%, to €33.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €39.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this development were lower sales in our South-western Europe segment as described above. The Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for nonrecurring and extraordinary effects) of our South-western Europe segment decreased by €7.2 million, or 17.7%, to €33.5 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €40.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012, as adjustments relating to our South-western Europe segment in the financial year 2012/2013 totaled €0.2 million (€1.3 million less than in the previous financial year) and related primarily to bad debt provisions. In the financial year 2011/2012, adjustments totaled €1.5 million and related primarily to restructuring costs in Spain. Expressed as a percentage of sales (net), our Adjusted EBITDA for our South-western Europe segment decreased from 7.8% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 6.6% in the financial year 2012/2013. The implementation of the above described store closure program, enhanced instore selling efforts, a change in the product mix more tailored to local markets, purchasing savings through group-wide program and a store staff efficiency program mitigated the negative margin impact from lost economies of scale. EBITDA of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €1.2 million, or 9.5%, to €13.8 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €12.6 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this development was an improved business performance in Romania, the Czech Republic and Lithuania. Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for nonrecurring and extraordinary effects) of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €1.3 million, or 10.3%, to €13.9 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €12.6 million in the financial year 2011/2012. Adjustments relating to our Eastern Europe segment in the financial year 2012/2013 totaled €0.1 million and related primarily to bad debt provisions, whereas in the financial year 2011/2012 we had no adjustments related to our Eastern European segment.

This increase mainly related to an increase in expense for financial liabilities at amortized cost of €56.9 million due to the above mentioned debt push down, while a decrease in expenses for non-controlling interest options by €1.1 million slightly offset the increase.

Of this increase, €308.9 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business (while an additional €60.1 million related to sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions between the Nocibé Business and the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France, which were eliminated on consolidation), which was not part of the Douglas Group in the first half of 2013/2014, but was included in the first half of 2014/2015. The remaining increase of €37.9 million, or 3.4%, in sales in the first half of 2014/2015 was driven by increased sales across all segments in particular due to strong sales over the 2014 Christmas period, the fact that the first half of 2014/2015 included the Easter holiday business (in March 2015) whereas in the financial year 2013/2014, the Easter holidays were in April and, thus, included in the second half of the financial year, the introduction of new product categories such as our Pantone skin tone measurement technology and our Professional Beauty products and increased sales relating to new products under our own brands labels, including such product lines as Douglas Naturals and Douglas Home Spa both of which were launched in September 2014. In addition, our e-commerce sales relating to our centrally managed online shops increased from €96.0 million in the first half of 2013/2014 to €145.3 million in the first half of 2014/2015 (of which €22.4 million related to the Nocibé Business). When excluding effects from the Nocibé Business, our e-commerce sales relating to our centrally managed online shops increased to €122.9 million in the first half of 2014/2015, corresponding to an increase of 28.0% when compared to the first half of 2013/2014. This increase was mainly driven by further results of the numerous operational excellence initiatives we have implemented, including a wide range of additional online service offerings, as well as the ongoing roll-out of our established German e-commerce platform as a blueprint into other countries. Our stationary business also contributed positively to the increase in our sales in the first half of 2014/2015. On a like-for-like basis, sales relating to our stationary stores increased by 1.5% in the first half of 2014/2015. This increase was primarily a consequence of ongoing effects of the implemented in-store initiatives and our improved assortment management process. Overall, including our stationary and our e-commerce business, the like-for-like growth rate of our sales in the first half of 2014/2015 was 3.9%, resulting from the various measures and initiatives implemented. Furthermore, first contributions from the Himmer and Clin D’Oeil stores which we acquired in December 2014 and February 2015, respectively, and which were partly included in our results for the first half of 2014/2015 positively affected our sales by €4.6 million in the first half of 2014/2015, with no corresponding effect in the first half of 2013/2014. On the other hand, the discontinuation of our French procurement organization, DBP Achats, which contributed sales of €17.6 million in the first half of 2014/2015 as compared to €25.4 million in the first half of 2013/2014, however, in both periods with marginal profitability, acted as a countereffect. On a segment level, sales (net) of our German segment increased by €33.1 million, or 5.4%, to €644.3 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €611.2 million in the first half of 2013/2014. This increase was mainly due to the ongoing strong sales growth of our German online shop, benefiting from our leading market position, strengthened online offerings and operational excellence initiatives. Furthermore, our German stationary business showed improved momentum and supported the increase in sales of the German segment in the first half of 2014/2015 primarily as a result of an enhanced focus on in-store sales measures such as the introduction of new store fittings with improved individual product presentation, particularly with respect to bestselling or promoted products. In addition, an improved gift card concept for the Christmas Business in 2014 and effects from enhanced cross-channel promotions also contributed to our improved business of our German stationary stores. Overall, including our stationary and our ecommerce business, sales (net) of our German segment experienced a like-for-like growth rate of 5.4% in the first half of ----- 2014/2015 which was, despite the continued focus on the optimization of our store portfolio, significantly higher than the like-for-like growth rate of 1.1% in the same period of the prior financial year. Sales (net) of our French segment increased by €300.4 million to €403.6 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €103.2 million in the first half of 2013/2014. This increase was attributable to the Nocibé Business which was not yet part of our Group in the first half of 2013/2014 and which contributed sales (net) of €308.9 million (while additional €60.1 million related to sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions of the Nocibé Business with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France, which were eliminated on consolidation) in the first half of 2014/2015. Sales (net) of our French Douglas Perfumeries Business decreased by €8.3 million in the first half of 2014/2015, mainly due to the discontinuation of our French procurement organization, DBP Achats, which contributed sales of €17.6 million in the first half of 2014/2015 as compared to €25.4 million in the first half of 2013/2014, however, in both periods with marginal profitability. Primarily due to the discontinuation of our French procurement organization, but also due to the streamlining of our product range in connection with the integration of our French Douglas Perfumeries Business into the Nocibé Business, on a like-for-like basis, sales (net) attributable to our segment France marginally decreased by 0.1%. Sales (net) of our French Douglas Perfumeries Business were also negatively impacted by the sales and transfers of 13 directly operated stores in the first half of 2014/2015 in order for the Nocibé Acquisition to comply with national and EU competition law. These effects were only in part compensated by first sales contributions from the 43 perfumeries pertaining to Clin d’Oeil which we acquired in February 2015. Sales (net) of our South-western Europe segment increased by €6.6 million, or 2.4%, to €276.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €269.9 million in the first half of 2013/2014, mainly as the result of the multiple measures which have been implemented in the last two financial years, including enhanced in-store selling efforts and a change in the product mix which is now even more tailored to the respective local markets. On a like-for-like basis, sales (net) of our segment South-western Europe increased by 1.9% in the first half of 2014/2015 as compared to the same period in the prior financial year. This positive trend was supported both by our stationary and our e-commerce business attributable to the South-western Europe segment. Sales (net) of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €6.7 million, or 5.4%, to €130.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €123.8 million in the first half of 2013/2014 and continued to be, in the first half of 2014/2015 jointly with our German segment, our fastest growing segment (when excluding the impact of the Nocibé Acquisition on our French segment). The main reasons for this increase were the positive gross domestic product (“GDP”) development in key markets of the Eastern Europe segment, particularly in Poland which accounted for roughly half of this segment’s sales in the first half of 2014/2015, with the selective beauty market benefitting over-proportionally, as well as our continued expansion in this segment through the opening of four stores in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. Furthermore, in particular sales from private label and exclusive products, but also e-commerce sales, increased significantly in our Eastern Europe segment in the first half of 2014/2015, as compared to the first half of 2013/2014.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Of this increase, €61.2 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business, which was not part of the Douglas Group in the financial year 2012/2013, but was included in the financial year 2013/2014 for the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Also, PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition of €8.1 million related to the sale of inventories in the normal course of business during the financial year 2012/2013 were recognized in cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise. Other than the effect attributable to the Nocibé Business, the main reasons for the remaining €2.1 million increase of our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise were one-off inventory revaluations in the amount €2.5 million, which were partially mitigated through the various cost control measures which we implemented. When adjusted for these extraordinary effects of €2.5 million, our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise slightly decreased in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared to the financial year 2012/2013 in which we incurred no such extraordinary costs in relation to raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise. Expressed as a percentage of sales, the ratio of our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise increased from 50.7% in the financial year 2012/2013 to 51.4% in financial year 2013/2014, corresponding to gross profit (defined as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise) expressed as a percentage of sales of 48.6% in the financial year 2013/2014, as compared to 49.3% in the financial year 2012/2013. ----- This development was mainly due to the above described effects from the Nocibé Acquisition, in particular, due to the negative impact from PPA effects regarding the Nocibé Acquisition. Furthermore, the higher share of our e-commerce sales in the financial year 2013/2014 which generally feature lower gross profit margins as compared to our sales from stationary stores and the Nocibé Business, which also feature lower gross profit margins as compared to the Douglas Perfumeries Business, negatively affected the ratio of our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise in financial year 2013/2014. Excluding the extraordinary effects of €10.6 million in the financial year 2013/2014 (of which €8.1 million related to PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition), our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise, expressed as a percentage of sales, in the financial year 2013/2014 would have increased from 50.7%, to 50.9%. This increase was mainly due to the increased utilization of customer discounts which led to a reduced level of sales at unaffected cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise. In contrast, positive impacts from our purchasing optimization program and an increased focus on higher margin products positively impacted our ratio of cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Expressed as a percentage of sales, the ratio of our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise increased from 50.1% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 50.7% in financial year 2012/2013.

Of this increase, cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise in an amount of €224.0 million (including cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise related to the above described €60.1 million sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions of the Nocibé Business with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France) were attributable to the Nocibé Business, which was not yet part of the Douglas Group in the first half of 2013/2014, but was included in the first half of 2014/2015. Also, PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition of €24.3 million related to the sale of inventories in the normal course of business during the first half of 2014/2015 were recognized in cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise.

This development was mainly due to the above described effects from the Nocibé Acquisition, in particular, due to the negative impact from PPA effects in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition. Excluding these effects from PPA as well as certain other extraordinary effects, our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise, expressed as a percentage of sales, in the first half of 2014/2015 would have increased from 52.1% to 52.4% due to the slightly lower gross margin levels of the Nocibé Business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Although our income from marketing and advertising costs recharged was positively impacted by the Nocibé Business by €2.5 million in the financial year 2013/2014, such income from marketing and advertising costs recharged overall decreased by €7.2 million, or 6.7%, mainly due to a reduced share of rechargeable marketing activities financed by our suppliers, the brand manufacturers, in the form of so-called “market development funds” as costs in connection with a significant campaign promoting the appeal of our Douglas brand in financial year 2013/2014 were not rechargeable. In addition, other costs recharged to related parties decreased by €4.0 million, or 20.1%, in the financial year 2013/2014, mainly as a result of a decrease in revenues from recharged energy costs. Also, in the financial year 2013/2014, our income from leasing and subleasing, resulting mainly from leased stores which are not used by us, but are subleased, decreased by €2.0 million, or 8.7%, resulting primarily from the transfer of certain lease agreements from us as original lessee to the entities pertaining to the Non-Acquired Business as the respective prior subtenant, prior to the Separation of the Non-Acquired Business. As a counter effect, in the financial year 2013/2014, our income from the reversal of provisions increased by €4.8 million, or 94.1%, as compared to the previous financial year, primarily related to the reversal of provisions formed in 2012/2013 relating to the operating business, in particular bonuses.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

This increase was primarily due to higher supplier subsidies relating to media advertising, as well as an increase of recharged print and catalogue costs in the financial year 2012/2013. ----- In addition, a number of smaller effects contributed to the increased other operating income in the financial year 2012/2013 including increased income from costs recharged to related parties, as well as increased income from leasing and subleasing.

Of this increase, personnel expenses in an amount of €22.3 million were attributable to the Nocibé Business, which was not part of the Douglas Group in the financial year 2012/2013, but was included in the financial year 2013/2014 for the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Other than the effect attributable to the Nocibé Business, the remaining increase of €6.3 million was attributable to extraordinary expenses in the amount of €16.6 million particularly in the form of severance payments which were expensed in the financial year 2013/2014 in relation to the downsizing of overhead personnel and other staff to further improve our overhead efficiency, as well as in relation to efficiency improvements in our German store portfolio. In the financial year 2012/2013, extraordinary expenses in the form of severance payments were incurred in the amount of €3.7 million and related mainly to the replacement of certain central management functions. As a result of these higher extraordinary expenses in the financial year 2013/2014, our wages and salaries increased to €373.3 million (figure adjusted to exclude Nocibé Business) as compared to €365.2 million in the prior financial year.

Apart from the effect attributable to the Nocibé Business, the remaining effect of a decrease in personnel expenses of €10.9 million was mainly attributable to the personnel efficiencies which we realized across our German store portfolio, in particular through staff reduction measures implemented in May and June 2014 which came to full effect in the first half of 2014/2015. Furthermore, besides these measures in Germany, stationary store staff efficiency measures which were implemented in particular in the financial year 2013/2014 in certain other countries, particularly in Spain and Croatia (where we closed a number of stationary stores), but also in the Netherlands and, to a smaller extent, in Austria and Italy showed positive effects on our personnel expenses in the first half of 2014/2015 whereas the same period in the financial year 2013/2014 was affected by severance payments of €6.0 million.

Overall, in the financial year 2013/2014, our expenses for other services increased by €34.6 million, or 59.2%, as compared to the prior financial year, whereof €2.2 million was attributable to the Nocibé Business. Furthermore, extraordinary costs, in part relating to rent increases in Austria based on the change-of-control triggered by the First Douglas Acquisition, against which we entered an objection, the outcome of which is still open, also contributed to the increase in rent and energy costs, increased to €2.0 million in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared to €1.4 million in the previous financial year. These rent increases were asserted during the course of the financial year 2012/2013 and affected the whole financial year for the first time in the financial year 2013/2014.

The decrease in rent and energy costs mainly related to a reduction of energy consumed and improved purchasing conditions for energy, while rent costs increased in line with general inflation. Our IT costs primarily decreased due to the implementation of an above average number of IT projects in the financial year 2012/2013, most of which related to the centralization and harmonization of our supply and logistics processes, with no such corresponding major effects in the financial year 2013/2014. Marketing and advertising costs decreased mainly due to efficiencies from the centralization and systematization of marketing functions such as planning, procurement, pricing and campaigning.

The other operating expenses were affected mainly by an increase of expenses for other services, which rose by €10.6 million, or 22.2%, in the financial year 2012/2013 because we incurred extraordinary expenses in the financial year 2012/2013 primarily relating to consulting fees for legal and tax advice in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition, whereas in the previous financial year, extraordinary costs were lower and related primarily to consulting fees, also mainly in connection with the First Douglas Acquisition. Furthermore, rent and energy costs increased by €7.1 million, or 3.1%, in the financial year 2012/2013 as compared to the prior financial year, which contributed to the increase in costs, mainly resulting from increased energy costs in 2012/2013, as in the prior financial year a one-time effect of €5.0 million relating to tax credits for energy efficiency had positively impacted rent and energy costs. Furthermore, a number of extraordinary costs were incurred in financial year 2013/2014, including in relation to rent increases in Austria of €1.4 million based on the change-ofcontrol triggered by the First Douglas Acquisition as described above. Marketing and advertising costs also increased by €6.5 million, or 6.4%, resulting primarily from higher costs for media advertising which, however, mainly corresponded with increased income from marketing and advertising costs recharged, as set out above. Expenses from subleases also increased in the financial year 2012/2013 by €4.1 million, or 29.3%, mainly due to the fact that an additional store was subleased and certain costs were reclassified in connection with the improvement of sublease conditions. Expressed as a percentage of sales, the ratio of our other operating expenses increased from 27.6% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 28.3% in financial year 2012/2013.

Of this increase, operating expenses of €70.5 million were attributable to the Nocibé Business, which was not yet part of the Douglas Group in the first half of 2013/2014, but was included in the first half of 2014/2015. Expressed as a percentage of sales, our other operating expenses decreased from 26.4% in the first half of 2013/2014 to 25.0% in the first half of 2014/2015. This development was mainly due to the disproportionately low increase in rent, ancillary rental costs and energy costs as a result of lower rent expenses as a percentage of sales for the Nocibé Group, the disproportionately strong e-commerce growth as well as a decrease in energy prices.

The Nocibé Business, which was not part of the Douglas Group in the first half of 2013/2014, but was included in the first half of 2014/2015, contributed €16.9 million to our net profit for the period. However, in the first half of 2014/2015, effects from PPA in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition negatively affected our net profit for the period in the amount of €17.2 million with no such effect in the previous financial year’s first half. A main reason for the increased profit for the period was the increase of our EBIT to €98.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €55.1 million in the first half of 2013/2014 due to the factors described above. This increase was in part compensated by an increase in income taxes from €5.1 million in the first half of 2013/2014 to €24.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015, mainly as a consequence of our improved earnings before taxes. Earnings from continued operations increased from €2.3 million in the first half of 2013/2014 to €26.2 million in the first half of 2014/2015. Earnings from discontinued operations increased from €31.8 million in the first half of 2013/2014 to €143.2 million in the first half of 2014/2015, mainly due to the appropriation of the purchase price with respect to the sales and transfers of the Books, Fashion and Jewelry Business to AI Beauty. Adjusted profit for the period increased by €9.8 million, or 21.5%, to €55.4 million in the first half of 2014/2015 from €45.6 million in the first half of 2013/2014. Adjustments totaled €-114.0 million in the first half of 2014/2015, of which €-143.2 million corresponded to the above described earnings from discontinued operations resulting from the appropriation of the purchase price with respect to the sales and transfers of the Books, Fashion and Jewelry Business to AI Beauty which were only adjusted in the first half of 2014/2015. Furthermore, €38.9 million related to adjustments made with respect to our EBITDA, €1.1 million related to impairment losses described above under EBIT and the corresponding tax effects amounted to €-10.8 million. In the first half of 2013/2014, adjustments totaled €11.5 million of which €15.7 million corresponded to the adjustments made with respect to the EBITDA, €0.1 million to impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as described above under EBIT while the corresponding tax effects totaled €-4.2 million. However, effects from PPA amortization in connection with the Nocibé Acquisition were not adjusted with respect to the adjusted profit for the period.

Of this increase, €101.2 million were attributable to the Nocibé Business (while an additional €10.4 million related to sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions of the Nocibé Business with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France, which were eliminated on consolidation), which was not part of the Douglas Group in the financial year 2012/2013, but was included in the financial year 2013/2014 for the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. The remaining increase of €13.0 million in sales in the financial year 2013/2014 was mainly driven by an increase of our e-commerce sales relating to our centrally managed online shops which experienced an increase of 24.1% from €145.1 million in the financial year 2012/2013 to €180.0 million in the financial year 2013/2014, primarily due to significant traffic volume growth, additional online service offerings and operational excellence initiatives. As a counter effect, sales relating to our stationary stores slightly decreased. On a like-for-like basis, sales relating to our stationary stores decreased by 0.4% in the financial year 2013/2014, an improvement compared to a decrease of 2.6% on a like-forlike basis in the financial year 2012/2013, driven by initial positive effects from implemented in-store optimization measures and improvements in assortment management processes most of which were implemented in the financial year 2013/2014. On a net basis, the number of stationary stores remained almost stable with an increase of two in the same financial period (excluding the acquisition of 373 stores as part of the Nocibé Acquisition) as we concentrated more on the optimization and less on the expansion of our store network. On a segment level, sales (net) of our German segment increased by €21.6 million, or 2.0%, to €1,100.8 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €1,079.2 million in the financial year 2012/2013. This increase was attributable to a strong increase in e-commerce sales, benefiting from our leading market position, strengthened online offerings and operational excellence initiatives. A decrease of sales (net) related to our stationary business which was mainly due to a reduction of the number of stores attributable to our German segment from 437 as of September 30, 2013 to 433 as of September 30, 2014 as part of the optimization of our store portfolio, was to some extent ----- counterbalanced by an enhanced focus on in-store sales measures targeting higher conversion rates (i.e., the number of persons buying a product in relation to the number of persons visiting our stores). On a like-for-like basis, sales (net) attributable to our German segment increased by 2.7% in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared with the financial year 2012/2013 due to the continued increase of our e-commerce sales and the enhanced focus on in-store sales measures targeting higher conversion rates (i.e., the number of persons buying a product in relation to the number of persons visiting our stores). Sales (net) of our French segment increased by €96.8 million, or 54.4%, to €274.9 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €178.1 million in the financial year 2012/2013. This increase was attributable to the Nocibé Business which contributed sales (net) of €101.2 million (while additional €10.4 million related to sales generated by the Nocibé Business through transactions of the Nocibé Business with the Douglas Perfumeries Business in France, which were eliminated on consolidation) in the period July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Sales (net) of our French Douglas Perfumeries Business decreased by €5.0 million in the financial year 2013/2014 whereby the main effect related to a reclassification of certain bonuses related to our recently discontinued purchasing cooperation DBP Achats in the amount of €6.1 million which were accounted as sales in the financial year 2012/2013 and as a positive effect on cost of sales in the financial year 2013/2014. As an additional counter-effect, the strong growth of our French e-commerce sales positively affected our sales (net) in the French segment. Furthermore, due to the streamlining of our product range in relation to the integration of our French Douglas Perfumeries Business into the Nocibé Business, sales (net) attributable to our private label products (excluding the Nocibé Business, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business) increased significantly, as we sold-off stocked private label products in connection with the rebranding of our French stores as Nocibé stores. On a like-for-like basis, our sales (net) in the French segment increased by 1.9% in the financial year 2013/2014 (excluding the Nocibé Business, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business), in particular due to a strong growth of our French e-commerce sales. Sales (net) of our South-western Europe segment decreased by €17.7 million, or 3.5%, to €489.3 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €507.0 million in the financial year 2012/2013. The main reason for this development was a weaker market environment in South-western Europe in connection with the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, resulting in an overall decline in customer demand. Furthermore, a slight decline in the number of stationary stores attributable to the segment (September 30, 2014: 360 stores; September 30, 2013: 364 stores (excluding franchised stores)) also contributed to the decrease of sales (net). On a like-for-like basis, sales (net) attributable to our Southwestern Europe segment decreased by 2.4% in financial year 2013/2014. In particular, segmental sales in South-western Europe from selective products and exclusive products, which typically have higher average price points, decreased. This decrease was only partially offset by an increase in e-commerce sales of the South-western Europe segment in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared to the prior financial year. Sales (net) of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €13.5 million, or 6.3%, to €228.3 million in the financial year 2013/2014 from €214.8 million in the financial year 2012/2013 and, thus, our Eastern Europe segment continued to be our fastest growing segment. In addition, the expansion of our Eastern European store network with 9 store openings on a net basis between September 30, 2013 (number of stationary stores: 264) and September 30, 2014 (number of stationary stores: 273), predominantly in Poland where we opened 11 stores. In general, the Polish selective beauty market showed continuous growth in the calendar year 2013, supporting our sales growth. Furthermore, on a likefor-like basis, our sales (net) increased by 5.2% in the financial year 2013/2014. In particular, sales (net) from private label and exclusive products, but also e-commerce sales increased significantly in the Eastern Europe segment in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared to the prior financial year.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The sales development was positively affected mainly by an increase of our total e-commerce sales through our centrally managed online shops which increased by 37.0% from €105.9 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €145.1 million in the financial year 2012/2013, primarily due to traffic volume growth as a result of increased online and other marketing activities, improvements to online shop usability, introduction of shorter delivery times as well as expansion of our product assortment. As a counter effect, on a net basis, we closed 14 of our directly operated stationary stores in the financial year 2012/2013 in our South-western Europe segment, mainly in Spain due to the difficult local economic environment resulting from the continued effects from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Also, sales relating to our stationary stores, on a like-for-like basis, decreased by 2.6% in the financial year 2012/2013, mainly attributable to our South-western Europe segment, and particularly Spain and Italy, due to the above described difficult local economic environment. The remaining effect was mainly attributable to sales contribution from store openings netted against store closings. ----- On a segment level, sales (net) of the German segment increased by €24.0 million, or 2.3%, to €1,079.2 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €1,055.2 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this development was the strong increase of our e-commerce sales in the financial year 2012/2013. On a likefor-like basis, sales (net) from our German segment increased by 1.7% in the financial year 2012/2013 as compared to the previous financial year. Sales (net) of the French segment increased by €23.6 million, or 15.3%, to €178.1 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €154.5 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this increase was contributions from the DBP Achats business, which operated our sourcing co-operation with Passion Beauté and comprised our wholesale activities in France, primarily with our French franchisees, but also franchisees of Passion Beauté. This business was only started in January 2012 and, as a consequence, French segment sales (net) in the financial year 2011/2012 only included contributions from this business for 9 months (excluding the Christmas period), whereas contributions from the DBP Achats business were included in the financial year 2012/2013 for the entire period. On a like-for-like basis, sales (net) of our French segment decreased by 2.0% in the financial year 2012/2013. Sales (net) of the South-western Europe segment decreased by €16.6 million, or 3.2%, to €507.0 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €523.6 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this development was a weaker market environment in South-western Europe in connection with the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, resulting in an overall decline in customer demand, most notably in Spain and Italy, but also in other countries in this segment. On a like-for-like basis, sales (net) in our South-western Europe segment decreased by 4.0% in the financial year 2012/2013. In order to address these challenges, in the financial year 2012/2013, we implemented a number of measures including a significant store portfolio restructuring in Spain, enhanced in-store selling efforts, a change in product mix more tailored to local markets, purchasing savings through group-wide programs and a staff efficiency program. Sales (net) of the Eastern Europe segment increased by €9.4 million, or 4.6%, to €214.8 million in the financial year 2012/2013 from €205.4 million in the financial year 2011/2012. The main reason for this development was the increase of our sales (net) in Poland primarily due to the continued growth of the Polish selective beauty market in the calendar years 2012 and 2013. In addition, increased sales (net) in Poland primarily related to improved store efficiency, and also partly to full year contributions by Polish stores which were opened during financial year 2011/2012. As a counter effect, closures of several stores in Croatia in the financial year 2012/2013 negatively impacted sales of the Eastern Europe segment.

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated from our operating activities and cash on our balance sheet. Following the Transactions, we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity will be cash flow from operations and drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes and our drawings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be used to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, consummate the related Transactions and pay related fees and expenses. Our ability to generate cash from our operating activities depends on future operating performance, which in turn depends to a certain extent on general economic, financial, competitive market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” We believe that our cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (which will be subject to certain conditions precedent) will be sufficient to fund our operating, capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Facilities Agreement.” The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, legal prohibitions on such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged in the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors.” There are also limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness,” “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of_ our cash flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In addition to the €43.4 million higher EBIT and the €7.9 million higher amortization/depreciation of noncurrent assets in the first half of 2014/2015 due to the effects described above, the main reason for this increase was the change in trade payables and other liabilities not classifiable to investing or financing activities which resulted in cash inflows of €73.7 million in the first half of 2014/2015 as compared to cash inflows of €22.3 million in the first half of 2013/2014, mainly resulting from combined effects of the increase in tax liabilities, the optimization of payment terms, later payments of ancillary wage costs and value added tax liabilities. Furthermore, changes in inventories, trade accounts receivable and other assets not classifiable to investing or financing activities resulted in decreased cash outflows in the amount of €27.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015 as compared to €37.1 million in the first half of 2013/2014 due to seasonal fluctuations. As counter effects, the net cash flow from operating activities in discontinued operations decreased in the first half of 2014/2015 to €0 from €33.5 million in the first half of 2013/2014 due to the sales and transfers of the Books Business, Fashion Business and Jewelry Business effective as of October 1, 2014. In addition, other non-cash income/expense resulted in cash outflows in the amount of €7.2 million in the first half of 2014/2015, whereas other non-cash income/expense contributed cash inflows of €17.0 million in the first half of 2013/2014 primarily due to increased non-cash effective tax expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In addition, other financial changes led to cash outflows of €3.5 million in the first half of 2014/2015 due to the purchase of outstanding shares in DPB Achats and, to a lesser extent, to dividends paid to minority shareholders with no such cash effect in the first half of 2013/2014. Furthermore, lower cash inflows from interest received impacted our net cash flow from financing activities, totaling €0.2 million as of March 31, 2015 as compared to €3.1 million as of October 1, 2014, mainly due to the discontinuation of interest payment by the Non-Acquired Business in relation to loans granted to the Non-Acquired Business.

In addition to the €37.5 million lower reported EBITDA in the financial year 2013/2014 due to significantly increased extraordinary expenses and one-off costs, changes in trade payables and other liabilities not classifiable to investing or financing activities contributed to this decrease, as we recorded a cash outflow of €14.4 million in the financial year 2013/2014, while we recorded a cash inflow of €45.4 million in the financial year 2012/2013. This development was mainly due to a transitory optimization of our tax liabilities which resulted from netting of tax liabilities and tax assets.

These further outflows were mainly due to a high non-cash tax income.

In addition, a significant reduction in taxes paid resulting in cash outflows of €5.8 million in the financial year 2013/2014 as compared to cash outflows of €35.0 million in the previous financial year also positively impacted our net cash inflow from operating activities.

While our reported EBITDA decreased from €169.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012 to €164.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013 due to significantly increased extraordinary expenses and one-off costs, the main driver for the increase of our net cash flow from operating activities was a decrease in cash outflows from changes in inventories, trade account receivables and other assets not classifiable to investing or financing activities which tied up €7.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013, as compared to €59.0 million in the financial year 2011/2012.

In addition, cash outflows relating to taxes paid decreased to €35.0 million in the financial year 2012/2013 as compared to €42.1 million in the financial year 2011/2012, primarily as a result of our reduced earnings before taxes. In the financial year 2012/2013, our net cash flow for investing activities amounted to €-38.8 million, as compared to €-61.9 million in the financial year 2011/2012, mainly due to reduced cash outflows for investments in noncurrent assets of €40.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013 as compared to cash outflows of €65.6 million in the financial year 2011/2012. In the financial year 2012/2013, our net cash flow from financing activities amounted to €-56.9 million, as compared to €-5.2 million in the financial year 2012/2011, mainly due to significantly increased cash outflows in relation to the repayments of equity in the amount of €156.3 million in the financial year 2012/2013 as set out above, whereas, in the prior financial year, no corresponding effect was recognized. In addition, cash inflows from proceeds from borrowings decreased to €62.0 million in the financial year 2012/2013, as compared to €142.7 million in the financial year 2011/2012.

We generally have access to various sources to finance operations, investments and potential acquisitions. This includes existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flow and bank credits. By signing up to the acquisition financing of Beauty Holding Three AG (which, effective as of February 20, 2013, was merged as the transferring entity upstream into Beauty Holding Two GmbH as the absorbing entity) in December 2012, we gained access to parts of the contractually agreed loans totaling €1,030.0 million. We used these loans to redeem our existing bank debt and to partly finance the acquisition of the shares of Douglas Holding AG by Beauty Holding Three AG. Beauty Holding Three AG’s liabilities to banks could be assumed to offset the dividends and profits payable to Beauty Holding Three AG by our subsidiaries. All of our German subsidiaries and some foreign subsidiaries are linked to a cash management system (cash pooling). By combining financing volumes, short-term liquidity surpluses of individual Group companies can be used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies.

Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or if there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cash generating units (“CGU”) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The ceiling for the allocation is generally the operating segment in conformity with IFRS 8.5. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of sale. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. Other intangible assets are carried at cost. Amortization is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognized in profit or loss. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to scheduled amortizations. They are tested for impairment at least once a year. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of such an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

Deferred taxes are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and unused tax losses for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.

From a product type perspective, we focus on selective beauty products from third-party, mostly premium brands (selective products), some of which are distributed exclusively by us on a European basis or for a specific region and for an agreed period of time (exclusive products), and on private label (own-brand) products, with which we target different segments within the European beauty and personal care market. The vast majority of our sales are generated within the selective beauty distribution channel, which is a channel based on a distribution model requiring compliance with specific criteria and formal approval of suppliers before a retailer can carry a selective product, as opposed to the mass distribution channel. We believe that this is an attractive and fast-growing market segment benefitting from positive market dynamics, and that it is thus a solid base for our future growth. Therefore, the following market description is based on the selective beauty distribution channel (herein also referred to as “selective beauty market”), which is a market segment within the broader European beauty and personal care market. For the purposes of the OC&C Report, the selective beauty market, as assessed by OC&C, includes beauty products pertaining to the selective type of products (including exclusive products) and also the beauty categories—fragrances, color cosmetics and skin care—pertaining to the private label type, although private label products, strictly speaking, do not represent selective products as they are not supplied by premium brand suppliers through the selective distribution channel, but rather directly sourced by the respective retailer from third-party manufacturers. For more information; see “—The European Selective Beauty Market—Definition of the European _Selective Beauty Market; Key Characteristics—Definition” below._ The European selective beauty market amounted to approximately €15.6 billion in 2013 and thus accounted for approximately 19% of the total European beauty and personal care market in that year. From a regional perspective, our most important markets are Germany and France, in which we generated approximately 44% and 27% of our sales, respectively, on a pro forma basis in the financial year 2013/2014. These two markets are also the two largest within the European selective beauty market and together accounted for over a third of the total European selective beauty market in 2013, according to the OC&C Report. Our other core markets are the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Austria. According to the OC&C Report, the six core markets, which together contributed ----- over 90% of our sales in the financial year 2013/2014, accounted for approximately 50% of the total European selective beauty market in 2013.

In the selective distribution channel of the European beauty and personal care market (as opposed to the mass market), brand manufacturers approve retailers to sell their products if they fulfill certain specific qualitative criteria, aiming at ensuring an appropriate premium sales environment for their brands; for example: - an adequate product and brand presentation in store (online players are required to have a physical store presence in order to be able to source their products through the selective distribution channel); - appropriate service levels through qualified and trained employees; - breadth of product assortment and product availability; - specialist advice and testing opportunities; - appropriate appearance and composition of stores; - the possibility to develop and market product innovations; and - minimum sales on a product level. Through such requirements, brand manufacturers select the retailers who they approve for the sale of their products. Selective distribution is a key means through which suppliers protect the often upscale reputation of their products and brands and exert control over the distribution of their branded products by using only distribution channels that fit the desired brand image. In general, the level of brand usage rights depends on the level of fulfillment of the different requirements. Suppliers, however, do not impose minimum price obligations on retailers. Fragrances, skin care and color cosmetics (make-up) are typical product categories sold via the selective distribution channel. By contrast, in the mass market, which includes hygiene products such as oral hygiene or bath and shower products, and also mass beauty products, there is no such selection of retailers and no selection of certain distribution channels. In the OC&C Report, the selective beauty market was derived from the total market for beauty and personal care per market region using a modeling methodology defining, firstly, the selective “channels”, which are market players with a substantial share of sales of selective beauty products, within the respective regional total beauty and personal care markets (for example, depending on the country, beauty specialist retailers (excluding monolabel stores), department stores and online players). Secondly, OC&C defined the key product categories sold, though not exclusively, through the selective distribution channel, i.e., the beauty product categories skin care, color cosmetics and fragrances, as opposed to hygiene product categories (which are not included in this definition of the selective beauty market). An estimation was made regarding the percentage of sales pertaining to selective beauty products within each of the defined channels (i.e., the share of selective products sold by department stores, e-commerce players, drugstores, etc.) in order to arrive at an approximation of the resulting “selective segment” value for each country, which also includes e-commerce sales of selective beauty products. When available, more detailed selective country data and other market derivation methods were used (for example, a bottom-up approach for France). Market size is based on net sales. ----- The following chart illustrates the size of the European selective beauty market within the broader European beauty and personal care market as used throughout this section:",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In addition, larger beauty retailers also benefit from certain economies of scale, such as advantages in purchasing conditions, as well as the ability to support promotions and other marketing activities on a larger scale. Large and influential manufacturers also often rely on large retailers to bring product innovations to the market. Large beauty retailers with cross-country presence can also significantly benefit from their established and long-term contractual relationships with premium fragrance, color cosmetics and skin care suppliers. Because only a limited number of retailers can meet the high demands of suppliers of selective beauty products, new (especially small) players face challenges when trying to enter the stationary or the online market. As a result, the selective environment supports relatively large market shares and, in many markets, consolidation opportunities, in particular in markets where there is still a relatively high level of fragmentation or where smaller players (such as independent retailers) are losing market share. Other advantages of large beauty retailers relate to e-commerce operations, since investments in e-commerce capabilities, for example, for the operation of the online platform, as well as multi-channel offerings may be leveraged across many countries. In addition, larger, well-known retailers with an e-commerce presence profit from their high brand recognition vis-à-vis customers, since consumers often seek a trusted and established partner, especially in times of ----- almost infinite product variety, when familiarity and guidance regarding their choice of product is particularly important to them.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

This regulation provides for an exemption from the prohibition of anti-competitive restrictions for selective distribution agreements if certain conditions are met. Such conditions aim to ensure, inter alia, fair competition between small and large retailers. They require, for example, that there be no guidelines and specifications setting the selling price of products (other than the permitted suggestion of a non-binding selling price), no guidelines as to which exact products to sell and to whom, and no behavior or distribution system that discriminates online retailers.

The selective beauty market in Eastern Europe also maintained its strong growth trajectory (CAGR for the 2008-2013 period was 6.0%; GDP CAGR for the period was 7.7%), driven by high inflation levels in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Turkey, according to the OC&C Report. From an overall perspective, the growth in Eastern Europe helped compensate for the market compression in Southern Europe, where the decline of GDP per capita was so persistent and unprecedentedly long that even the typically resilient selective market was affected: The CAGR of the selective beauty market in Southern Europe for the 2008-2013 period was -3.1%, while GDP decline was 0.9% per year in the region during this period. With a CAGR of -13.3% for the period, the selective beauty market in Greece had a disproportionally large negative impact on the development of the region; excluding Greece, the selective beauty market in Southern Europe only declined by 2.4% (on a CAGR basis) from 2008 to 2013, according to the OC&C Report.

In addition, fragrances are propagated as an integral part of lifestyle of modern consumers by advertising campaigns. Furthermore, these products are often used as gifts and as a first entrance into the luxury products market.

We believe that there are a number of opportunities for us to exploit this growth, especially with our strong multi-channel positioning, which allows us to meet our customers’ store-based and online requirements (see “—Key Trends—Shopping as a multi-channel experience” below).

For example, according to the OC&C Report, based on a customer survey carried out by Innofact AG in October/November 2014, in Germany, 27% of the surveyed male customers plan to spend more on beauty products in the future; surveys carried out in our other core countries revealed a similar trend.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

On the one hand, customers increasingly purchase online, which may save them time, money and effort (for example, for customers who want to efficiently make pre-selected or replenishment purchases). Online shopping also allows customers to browse through a broad selection of products quickly. In this respect, a trend towards an increasing use of mobile applications (which enable easy access, anywhere and anytime) can also be observed. On the other hand, customers may also remain, with respect to beauty products, offline customers, because they wish to see, feel, smell and test many beauty products in person, and appreciate the physical store experience in attractive surroundings. Also, friendly, personal and competent customer advice are aspects of a shopping experience which cannot currently be provided to the same extent online. This underscores the increasing importance for beauty retailers of store location (particularly, of prime locations in urban centers) and appearance as well as qualified staff able to provide expert advice and an excellent online offering.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,2407,MARKET AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT,2407.9,Competitive Environment,2407.9.1,,"According to the OC&C Report, we are the leading European selective beauty and personal care retailer with a market share of approximately 16.5% based on aggregated sales for Douglas and Nocibé for the full calendar year 2013 (including both stationary store and e-commerce sales of third-party (selective), exclusive and private label products, as well as franchises), ahead of Sephora (Sephora SA, Boulogne Billancourt, “Sephora”) with approximately 11.3%, and Marionnaud (Marionnaud SAS, Paris, “Marionnaud”) with approximately 7.7%. We are also among the top 3 selective beauty retailers in all of our six core markets, holding market leading positions in Germany and Poland, second positions in France, the Netherlands and Austria, and third position in Italy, in each case based on 2013 net sales figures (source: OC&C Report; the calculation includes franchise and regional e-commerce sales, where applicable, and for our Group, both Douglas and Nocibé sales). For more information, see the respective “Competitive Environment” sections for the different regional markets below. Within the European selective beauty market, our most relevant competitors include (i) other beauty specialist retailers/perfumeries with a presence in several European countries, such as Sephora and Marionnaud (there are relatively few selective beauty specialists with a substantial size), (ii) the selective beauty departments of selected department stores (such as GALERIA Kaufhof (GALERIA Kaufhof GmbH, Cologne, “Galeria Kaufhof”) and Karstadt (Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH, Essen, “Karstadt”) in Germany), including those of luxury department stores, such as those of Galeries Lafayette (Galeries Lafayette SA, Paris, France, “Galeries Lafayette”), as well as (iii) some drugstores with a separate section for selective products (such as Müller (Müller Holding Ltd. & Co. KG, Ulm-Jungingen, “Müller”) in Germany). Most drugstores, as well as food retailers and other similar competitors offer predominantly mass market products in most countries, and thus typically do not directly compete with us in the selective beauty market. ----- In addition, we compete with duty free shops and monolabels such as Yves Rocher (Laboratoires de Biologie Végétale Yves Rocher SA, La Gacilly/Morbihan, France, “Yves Rocher”) or Kiko (a label of KIKO S.p.A., Bergamo, Italy, “Kiko”). Monolabels represent significantly smaller businesses with a more limited product range of own brands and with their own distribution channel; however, we compete for customers with such monolabels, even if they are not part of the selective distribution channel. We also compete with so-called online pure-play or primarily online-based competitors. Online players include (i) online perfumeries (such as the platform “Flaconi” of Flaconi GmbH, Berlin, Germany or “Escentual” (a trading name of Central Pharmacy, Perfumery and Clarins Gold Salon which operates from registered pharmacy premises located in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom)), which mostly focus on both selective and non-selective brands, and (ii) retail platforms (for example, amazon or eBay). Online perfumeries that fulfill the suppliers’ requirements, such as a physical store presence, opportunities for customers to test products or the provision of comprehensive customer advice in the stores (even with a rather limited stationary presence) may source their products through the selective distribution channel. However, similar to monolabel competitors, online pure-play competitors or nearly pure-play online perfumeries tend to be small in size and currently typically lack the brand name and scale of major beauty specialist retailers such as Douglas and many cannot currently fully compete with multi-channel and store-based players in the selective beauty markets. Other online competitors, such as generalist retail platforms and marketplaces (which offer other products besides beauty and personal care products), mostly operate in the mass market segment. A limited “grey market” exists in some of the typically non-selective retail formats, such as drugstores, food retailers or online marketplaces, in which certain selective products are sold through channels other than those official channels explicitly allowed by the manufacturers, sometimes even at discount prices. For example, online players which are not duly authorized by the respective suppliers to distribute their selective products may obtain selective products from authorized retailers that want to dispose of excess or older stock. In addition, selective products that are sold more cheaply in not yet established regional markets or emerging markets may be introduced in established markets at lower prices through the re-import of products from other countries or otherwise. However, the grey market remains limited because suppliers of selective products and selective retailers such as our Group regularly adopt measures aiming at counteracting grey market activities as soon as they become aware of them (e.g., by implementing tools and devices that allow for tracking of their stock, such as hidden codes). Grey market issues are also relevant, depending on the country, with respect to the stationary store business where we have noticed increased competition from grey market products in particular in Austria, Spain and Poland, especially in certain cases in which drugstores and discounters want to expand their selective offerings and source selective products from the gray market. Furthermore, these types of offerings sometimes also extend to counterfeit products. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and _Business—We face competition in the markets in which we operate and such competition may intensify further.”_ While the competitive landscape varies by country, the larger specialist beauty retailers that are present across several European countries (such as Douglas, Sephora and Marionnaud) are generally also the most important players in the respective selective beauty markets, with the top-2 or top-3 players typically commanding a significant market share. For example, in the six core countries for our business (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Austria), the respective top 2 players hold, on average, an aggregated market share of more than 60% (unweighted, i.e., without weighing in the relative size of each regional market within the total European selective beauty market), based on 2013 sales. The level of concentration varies, in some cases substantially, among the six countries and points to further consolidation opportunities in markets where the concentration is still low. We also believe that, in part as a result of the above-mentioned significant selective distribution requirements of brand manufacturers, the market share of large and cross-country selective retail chains with a very large store network and high brand awareness has grown at the expense of smaller chains, as the market has progressively consolidated in recent years.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

OC&C calculated our share based on our total sales for 2013, i.e., including selective and non-selective products and services (whereby non-selective products account for only a small portion of our sales). For the calculation of sales of competitors certain assumptions were made in the OC&C Report. For example, the beauty and care sales share of Karstadt was used as a proxy for the calculation of the total sales of department stores; for online players, the total sales of online pure players (including primarily online-based competitors) and an estimation for generalists (e.g., amazon) were used. The remaining market is very fragmented: The next largest player is Müller (with an estimated market share in 2013 at least 8% to 10%, based on an estimation by OC&C of the share of Müller’s sales that relates to selective beauty products, made on the basis of data included in a consumer survey and other sources), followed by Pieper (Stadt-Parfümerie Pieper GmbH, Herne, Germany, “Pieper”) (with around 4% market share, according to the OC&C Report). While mass market, non-selective products are primarily distributed by drugstores, department stores and online retailers in Germany, the selective market is covered by perfumeries, distinct selective beauty areas in department stores, to some extent by online retailers and by the drugstore chain Müller, which offers a range of selective beauty products in separate areas of selected stores. Müller and other perfumeries also offer mass beauty and personal care products. According to the OC&C Report, specialist beauty retailers (for this calculation, including the estimated selective beauty sales of Müller stores) account for approximately 75% of the selective market in Germany. The OC&C Report expects that these beauty specialist retailers will continue to play an important role in the market in the coming years. According to the OC&C Report, the online channel, which already grew strongly in the past few years, is expected to gain further importance in the coming years (see “—Market Size, Past Development and Prospects” above). Other store-based perfumeries are significantly smaller and compete only locally. Players like Pieper, HC Parfümerie (Parfümerie H.C. GmbH & Co KG, Barsinghausen, Germany) and Parfümerie Becker (Schwanen-Parfümerie Chemikalien-Großhandel Willi Becker GmbH, Neuss, Germany) are the only cross-regional chains, but with much smaller store networks (around 130 stores, 80 stores and 70 stores, respectively, for 2014, according to the OC&C Report, compared to for example, 433 stores for Douglas as of September 30, 2014 and approximately 510 Müller stores in 2014). According to the OC&C Report, department stores are an alternative channel for the purchase of selective beauty and personal care products, although department stores are struggling with declining sales and are in a late lifecycle stage. Drugstores currently mostly sell discount or mass products. Monolabels such as Yves Rocher or The Body Shop (The Body Shop International plc, London, England, United Kingdom) represent significantly smaller businesses; many operate in rather niche segments (and thus rather act in a “parallel” market) (source: OC&C Report); some of these monolabels have shop-in-shop partnerships with us. Through these partnerships, we are able to further deepen our expertise (e.g., through brand-specific beauty experts) and further strengthen our image; the shop-in-shop solutions typically have a premium layout that increases store traffic with customers looking for one of these brands and enhances the shopping experience of our customers. ----- With respect to the German online market for selective beauty products, the competitive landscape comprises online pure players and primarily online-based players (for example, Parfumdreams, a website operated by Parfümerie akzente GmbH, Pfedelbach, Germany, “Parfumdreams”, and Flaconi), multi-channel players (such as Douglas and Pieper), department stores, drugstores (such as Müller) and generalists, shopping clubs and marketplaces (such as amazon).

Market figures relate to net sales. - CAGR According to the OC&C Report, historical growth in the German selective beauty market was mainly driven by color cosmetics (with a CAGR of 7.8% in the 2009-2013 period) as well as fragrances (with a CAGR of 5.8% and 5.0% for men and women’s fragrances, respectively, over the same period; the overall 2009-2013 CAGR for fragrances was 5.3%). Alongside the key general market growth drivers (see “—The European Selective Beauty Market—Key _trends” above), within color cosmetics (a segment with a €0.50 billion value in 2013, according to the OC&C Report),_ growth was driven by a stronger demand among younger consumers, an increased importance attributed to looks across age groups, as well as select product innovations (especially in nail polish, with limited and seasonal editions). The color cosmetic products for eyes, face, lips and nails represented major growth sub-categories during the 2009- 2013 period. With respect to fragrances, men’s fragrances (which accounted for approximately one third of the German market volume for selective fragrances with €0.43 billion in 2013) grew at a CAGR of 5.8% slightly faster than women’s fragrances (market volume of €0.84 billion in 2013, CAGR of 5.0%) between 2009 and 2013, according to the OC&C Report. An increasing prestige consciousness among men and a stronger demand for in-store product experience and advice (compared to other product categories) are key drivers of the growth in fragrance sales. Skin care (including sun care and, for Germany, fragrance-related skin care, e.g., body lotions with the scent of a particular fragrance) reached a market size of €0.66 billion in 2013 and a CAGR for the 2009-2013 period of 2.5%. Growth within this product category was primarily driven by the increased demand of an aging society, especially regarding facial care, and an increasing product differentiation trend, e.g., natural cosmetics or products with special functions; products that experienced high growth rates within such period include daily cleansing, special care, anti-aging and daily care (source: OC&C Report). The OC&C Report expects that major underlying, sustainable long-term consumer trends (see also “—The _European Selective Beauty Market—Key Trends”) will continue to foster growth across all categories of the selective_ beauty market in Germany, with an estimated CAGR of 4.9% for the 2013-2019 period. By way of comparison, the mass channel (including both mass hygiene and mass beauty products) in Germany is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.5% over the same period (with mass beauty products expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% over such period). The OC&C Report also expects color cosmetics to remain the fastest growing category, with projected growth at rates similar to historic levels in the next few years. This growth is expected to be driven by continued demand from younger customers, fast-changing fashion trends and a growing interest in a flawless appearance across the different age-groups. According to the OC&C Report, growth in fragrances for men shall be encouraged by a higher prestige and physical appearance awareness among men, while female fragrances shall also continue their past growth trend, supported by innovative products and the persisting role of fragrances as first entry into the luxury market and as gifts. Overall, the fragrance ----- category is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% over the 2013-2019 period. The skin care category is expected to further benefit from the anti-aging trend and product innovations, which contribute to lasting differentiation success; furthermore, the increasing male awareness regarding their appearance is expected to lead to a rising number of men buying skin care products (source: OC&C Report). The relevant online market for selective beauty products in Germany has demonstrated a strong growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of approximately 35.2% during the 2009-2013 period, with sales of €263 million in 2013 (source: OC&C Report). The OC&C Report expects this online market to maintain its dynamic growth in the coming years and projects that it will grow at a 2013- 2019 CAGR of approximately 17.5%. Growth rates for the German online selective beauty market are thus expected to be strong, but lower than in the 2009-2013 period. This is due, in part, to the fact that new players are less likely to enter the market and the potential fade away of smaller players (source: OC&C Report). For calculations regarding the online market, OC&C made an assumption regarding the selective sales of multi-channel players, online generalists, shopping clubs and marketplaces and extrapolated the factored-in growth assumptions with respect to our Group from our business plan as part of its market growth estimate. The online penetration of the German selective beauty market amounted to 11% in 2013, according to the OC&C Report. The larger online market for beauty products is, compared to other retail segments, still somewhat underpenetrated with only 6% of the total beauty sales in Germany being generated from the online channel in 2013 (whereby for this purpose, sales for both selective and mass fragrances, color cosmetics and skin care (including sun care) were considered) and thus offers significant further upside potential, especially for multi-channel players (source: OC&C Report).",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

As a nationally operating retailer, Nocibé has a stronger geographical reach outside the Paris metropolitan area, where department stores are seldom present. Pharmacies/parapharmacies and drugstores mainly offer non-selective beauty products and attract a different customer group. Monolabels operating in France such as Yves Rocher, L’Occitane (L’Occitane International S.A., Luxembourg, Luxembourg) or Kiko mostly target different customer groups, in our view, with limited product and price overlap compared to Nocibé (except for color cosmetics).

By way of comparison, the mass channel (including both mass hygiene and mass beauty products) in France is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.2% over the same period (with mass beauty products expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7% over such period). Within the French selective beauty market, growth in color cosmetics (projected CAGR of 3.7% for 2013-2019) is mainly expected to be supported by innovation, more seasonal themes, and the development of private label and exclusive products. Skin care demand is expected to be supported through the development of new high-performance products, especially in the high-price segment (projected CAGR of 1.4% for 2013-2019). According to the OC&C Report, the market value for fragrances is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2013 and 2019, supported by slight price increases and stabilizing demand (especially if the expected increase in GDP materializes) as well as the launch of new formats and fragrances to increase differentiation in the market (especially for younger women).

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate in 19 European countries with over 1,700 stores (including franchised stores) and have e-commerce operations in 15 countries. In five of our six core countries (i.e., in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Austria), we have a top 1 or top 2 market position. In those five core countries, we generated over 80% of our sales in the financial year 2013/2014 on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to our acquisition of the Nocibé Group. Since being taken private in the financial year 2012/2013, Douglas has been transformed from a predominantly German diversified retail conglomerate into a leading pan-European selective beauty retailer. Our former non-beauty operating retail businesses were either sold to a third party or transferred to subsidiaries of Seller 1. Substantial operational improvement initiatives have been implemented over the past two years, particularly in the financial year 2013/2014 under a largely new management team, to further enhance our business model and position it for continued profitable growth going forward. In June 2014, we acquired the Nocibé Group, a leading beauty retailer in France to further strengthen our market position in France and as the leading specialist retailer of selective beauty and personal care products in Europe. With an estimated compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) for calendar years 2013-2019 of 2.6%, the selective beauty market, which generally has shown a high degree of resilience even in periods of extended down cycles, is expected to exhibit attractive and sustainable growth and reach an overall market volume of €18.2 billion in 2019.

This assortment is complemented by a range of beauty-related accessories as well as selected service offerings. Our extensive product offerings across a wide range of price points make us a preferred brand for beauty and personal care in Europe. We believe that we distinguish ourselves by a customer-centric sales approach offering our customers high quality advice and services and that this, together with our reputation and our broad, wellinvested store network in prime locations, as well as e-commerce capabilities, make us a “must-have” distribution platform for the major suppliers of selective beauty products.

It is therefore more attractive for us than the larger mass retailing market for beauty and personal care products which is characterized by greater competition and lower profit margins. In the ----- selective beauty market, manufacturers of premium brands limit the distribution of their products to selected qualified retailers in order to enhance the often premium reputation of their products and brands, and control the distribution of their brands. In this regard, suppliers require, for example, adequate product and brand presentation in store, appropriate service levels through qualified and trained employees as well as breadth of product assortment, before approving distribution of their products by a specific retailer. Suppliers therefore generally favor retailers with strong brand awareness, customer reach and large nationwide store networks. Thus, the economics of the selective distribution channel typically do not work for drugstores, supermarket and similar retail formats and they mostly focus on the mass market instead (see also “Market and Competitive Environment—The European Selective Beauty Market—Definition of the _European Selective Beauty Market; Key Characteristics” and “—Regulatory Environment—Regulation on the Selective Channel”)._ The total selective beauty market in Europe totaled €15.6 billion in 2013 and has shown a strong resilience even in a challenging economic environment. Beauty products (color cosmetics, skin care and also fragrances) are often perceived as accessible high-value gifts and so-called “personal rewards”, which has contributed to the demand for such products in general remaining stable historically and showing resilience even during periods of extended economic downturns. In Europe’s two largest economies, Germany and France, which are also our two largest markets and which together accounted for 71% of our pro forma sales in the financial year 2013/2014, after giving effect to our acquisition of the Nocibé Group, the selective beauty market has historically grown at a stronger rate than the larger mass market for beauty and personal care products (comprising beauty and hygiene categories) with respective CAGRs of 5.0% and 1.4% in Germany, and respective CAGRs of 3.1% and 1.2% in France, in each case in the 2009-2013 period, according to the OC&C Report. According to the OC&C Report, in the coming years, the selective beauty market segment is expected to continue to outgrow the mass beauty and personal care market in many European countries. For example, according to the OC&C Report, in Germany, the selective beauty market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% in the 2013-2019 period, which compares to 1.5% for the mass market for beauty and personal care products in the same period, while in France the selective beauty market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.0% for the 2013-2019 period, while the mass market is expected to grow at a CAGR of only 1.2% CAGR in the same period. The selective segment in Eastern Europe also maintained a growth trajectory at a CAGR of 6.0% for the calendar years 2008 to 2013, according to the OC&C Report.

We have a highly attractive and balanced product portfolio, with fragrances contributing more than half, color cosmetics and skin care approximately one fifth each and other products only a small portion to our total consolidated sales in the first half of 2014/2015. Our broad assortment range and a service offering, which we believe to be one of the largest in the industry, make us a trusted destination for customers of premium beauty care products. Our product offering includes many different major national and international brands. These brands are sourced from suppliers with whom we maintain strong, often long-term relationships. We enhance our customer value through a customer-centric sales approach offering our customers high quality advice, service innovations and the introduction of new categories, to capture the latest trends in beauty as identified in our systematic trend scouting process. For example, we launched the Pantone-based “Douglas Color Expert” in August 2014, a feature that identifies the customer’s individual skin tone and allows for personalized make-up recommendations, and introduced the new product sub-category “Professional Beauty” which includes electrical skin cleaning brushes. We complement our broad assortment range of selective products with attractive exclusive and private label products which allow for differentiation vis-à-vis key competitors and act as an additional margin driver. Thus, we consider exclusive and particularly private label products to be key growth contributors, which, especially in the case of private label, have significantly higher gross margins than third party beauty products. As a consequence, in the last two years, we have put a strong focus on significantly expanding our exclusive and private label expertise. Sales from private label products accounted for 2.8% of our total combined sales in the financial year 2013/2014 (figure on a combined basis; adjusted to include the Nocibé Business for the whole financial year 2013/2014). The Nocibé Group on a stand-alone basis (not including former Douglas and Clin d’Oeil stores rebranded to Nocibé) ----- generated a higher sales share of approximately 8% from its private label products in the short financial year ended September 30, 2014 than the Douglas Perfumeries Business in the financial year 2013/2014, with both shares still being well below the private label sales share of best-in-class competitors with respect to private label products. Since the implementation of its dedicated private label strategy in April 2012, the Nocibé Group grew the number of private label SKUs to more than 1,400 (as of March 31, 2015), for example through the launch of Nocibé’s professional private label make-up line “Artist” in 2014. We believe that the strong growth of the Nocibé Group’s private label assortment helped to further increase the attractiveness of the products, positively impacted store traffic, led to improved average purchase value and enabled Nocibé to access a more “trend-oriented” target group with new and younger customers, thereby rejuvenating and broadening Nocibé’s customer base and image. Since the second half of calendar year 2014, we have begun to leverage these private label capabilities developed by the Nocibé Group in France increasingly across other European countries in order to further complement our assortment of products, attract new customers, drive customer loyalty and further improve our margins. Furthermore, according to the OC&C Report, based on a customer survey carried out by Innofact AG in October/November 2014 and analyzed by OC&C, we were rated first among the selected competitors that were included in the survey with respect to staff friendliness and staff availability in Germany and France. Our beauty advisors are specifically trained to provide friendly and sound advice, which we believe is of critical importance in our sector and a differentiating factor vis-à-vis many competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In our key markets of Germany and France our stores have nationwide coverage. In Germany, we have an extensive store portfolio of 436 stores (as of March 31, 2015, all stores directly operated) in prime locations. In the calendar year 2013, we generated a multiple of the sales (regarding selective beauty products) of our next competitor, based on survey results and the competitor’s estimated share of selective products, according to the OC&C Report. We have continuously invested in our store network as demonstrated by relatively stable expenses for store modernization and refurbishment, which accounted for the large part of our capital expenditures in the last three financial years. In France, we have advanced to a second place market position, based on our aggregated sales for the calendar year 2013 for Douglas and Nocibé, including regional online sales and franchise sales but excluding certain intra-group consolidations (as assessed in the OC&C Report; calculation includes stationary and online sales). We have a nationwide store network with approximately twice as many stores as the market leader Sephora (our store number, as of September 30, 2014, including franchises, and prior to our disposition of a number of our French stores after such date in order to comply with requirements included in the antitrust approval of the Nocibé Acquisition; for Sephora’s store number, as of June 2014). Our modular store concept allows for unique flexibility to adapt store sizes, assortment breadth, store layout and visual merchandising and enables us to successfully operate with smaller and medium sized stores in smaller towns where we may have less competition from operators focusing on larger stores.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

We believe that we can provide a highly integrated offering across all channels and have implemented state-of-the-art cross-channel services and customer relationship management. We consider this a competitive advantage, in particular vis-à-vis pharmacies, drugstores and smaller players that do not have the same multi-channel competency. We consider an attractive, easy to use multi-channel approach as particularly important in the beauty retail sector since customers increasingly purchase online to save time, money and effort, but at the same time most of them wish to see, feel, smell and test many beauty products in person. Also, store experience and friendly customer advice are parts of a shopping experience which we consider to be difficult to reproduce for a pureplay online retailer. Our multi-channel capabilities allow us to serve our customers across channels, and our size and seamless processes facilitate the necessary logistics and the realization of economies of scale. Furthermore, we believe that our online shops distinguish themselves from large unspecialized retail platforms through broad assortment and ----- product presentation which we believe corresponds better to the premium reputation of the suppliers’ brands, as well as through complementary service offerings such as the recently implemented Pantone-based Douglas Color Expert. We believe that our e-commerce operations are a key contributor to our growth (see “—Sales Channels, Multi_Channel Approach and Payment Methods—Our E-Commerce Platform”) and in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, our centrally managed online shops (i.e., our online shops in Germany, France—including, for the first half of 2014/2015, e-commerce sales of €22.4 million from the Nocibé Business—, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland) contributed sales of €229.3 million, or 9.4% of total sales. In Germany, we are the leader in the online market for selective beauty products (with a market share of approximately 51% in the calendar year 2013, based on net e-commerce sales, according to the OC&C Report). According to the same source, we held the second position in the online selective beauty segment in France (approximately 25%, based on 2013 e-commerce sales, aggregated for the Nocibé and the Douglas e-commerce platform, which at the time operated separately). Our French e-commerce activities are now consolidated under the Nocibé brand. We believe that our e-commerce growth at a CAGR of 30.4% in the financial years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 reflected the consistent implementation of our multi-channel strategy which we intensified and further improved over the last two to three years. Also, as a result of our increased e-commerce sales in the past three financial years, we improved our average fixed cost coverage and, thus, achieved what we consider to be an attractive profitability and benefits from scalability with respect to the cost base of our e-commerce business. In the recent past, e-commerce sales have had a higher profitability before overhead costs as compared to sales in our physical stores. In addition, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from the expected dynamic growth in the online segment of the selective beauty market in Europe as, for example, the German and French selective online markets are expected to continue on their growth trajectory at expected CAGRs for the period 2013-2019 of 17.5% and 12.5%, respectively, according to the OC&C Report. We offer a number of highly integrated cross-channel services along the relevant customer touch points, covering pre-sales information, stock availability, consultation, payment as well as delivery of products and returns. With in-store orders, click-and-collect, online stock information, online appointment scheduling before store visits or crosschannel couponing, we have implemented innovative new service features. We use all channels—stationary stores and ecommerce (including online and mobile solutions)—in a jointly incentivized, integrated, manner to enhance our customer experience and brand loyalty by offering our customers increased convenience and a better, more personalized shopping experience. We believe that we were one of the first specialist beauty retailers to launch dedicated mobile applications for iOS devices and for Android devices (launched in 2010 in Germany, France and the Netherlands) that enabled our customers to purchase products directly on our websites from their iOS or Android devices. Since December 2013, we implemented these applications in Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Norway. In April 2015, we launched an additional dedicated application for iOS-tablets in Germany, and, in October 2014, we introduced a guided selling application in certain pilot stores in Germany, which assists store personnel in the customer service processes by providing, for example, access to product and purchase recommendations, as well as customer reviews. We expect to further roll-out the guided selling application starting in the third quarter of financial year 2014/2015. We believe that this guided selling app may help to further integrate our sales channels, as well as to further improve our services. Our multi-channel offering and cross-channel services are complemented through an, in our view, industry leading customer relationship management and loyalty program. Our Douglas loyalty card program has around 10 million cardholders across 16 countries across Europe. Nocibé has its own loyalty program with around 8 million additional holders in France and Monaco.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In the last two financial years, and particularly in 2013/2014, we implemented a wide range of strategic and operational initiatives to achieve higher sales growth. Such initiatives included for our stationary business an improved assortment management process and the successful implementation of in-store activation measures, such as the introduction of a new visual design, the roll-out of new product displays, improvement of visual merchandizing and marketing concepts and the usage of professionalized space management. In addition, for our fast growing e-commerce business, we continued implementing operational excellence initiatives, introduced new online service offerings and accelerated the pan-European roll-out of e-commerce operations. As a result of these measures, our sales growth rate has significantly improved in the financial year 2013/2014 and particularly in the first half of 2014/2015. Our like-for-like growth rate increased from 1.6% in the ----- financial year 2013/2014 to 3.9% in the first half of 2014/2015. This was driven both by an improvement of our stationary as well as our e-commerce business like-for-like growth rate, with our e-commerce operations benefitting from strong market momentum and our competitive position in the European online selective beauty market. In the first half of 2014/2015, our sales growth rate was positive across all of our four regional segments, with particularly strong growth in our regional segments of Germany and Eastern Europe (both increasing sales by 5.4% compared to the first half of 2013/2014). Our South-Western Europe segment returned to positive growth following a challenging period, with positive momentum being driven by significant actions undertaken in recent years. Furthermore, since being taken private in the financial year 2012/2013, we have implemented a wide range of efficiency enhancing measures. These actions included sales efficiencies at store level, partly caused by store staff reductions across various regions, overhead personnel reductions, mainly in Germany and South-Western Europe, a stricter cost management throughout our organization, and an active management of our store portfolio in all four regional segments, including a store network re-shape in Spain and Croatia. Furthermore, we have recently focused on excellence in the execution of our processes, for example through the centralization and systematization of selected functions such as assortment planning, procurement, pricing and campaigning as well as through the improvement of support and administrative processes. These centralization and systematization measures allow for significant cost savings in our previously very decentralized organization. For example, in 2013/2014, we negotiated and implemented Europe-wide sourcing contracts with our most important suppliers of goods for resale in order to secure competitive margins. In addition, we launched a comprehensive sourcing program in the financial year 2013/2014 to optimize sourcing of indirect goods, such as energy, marketing materials or logistics, facility management and IT services. We believe the first results of these measures, as well as of the growth and value-creation initiatives described above, were the main factors which led to the improvement of our Adjusted EBITDA, which on a stand-alone basis for the Douglas Perfumeries Business, i.e., excluding the EBITDA contribution of the Nocibé Business in the financial year 2013/2014, increased by a CAGR of 5.6% across the last three financial years, and by a CAGR of 9.9% across the last three and a half years including the first half of 2014/2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA-margin for the Douglas Perfumeries Business also increased as a result of the first effects from the above described strategy of cost control and efficiency enhancement, but also from a better fixed cost coverage of our fast growing online operations, from 8.9% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 9.1% and 9.5% in the financial years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 (all figures on a combined basis; figures for the financial year 2013/2014 adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Nocibé Business in the period July to September 2014, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business). On pro forma basis, our Adjusted EBITDA totaled €256.0 million and our Adjusted EBITDA-margin increased even stronger to 10.3% in the financial year 2013/2014. This positive margin trend accelerated in the first half of 2014/2015, with many of the strategic and operational measures successfully implemented in the financial year 2013/2014 now starting to have positive financial effects in all of our four regional segments. When adjusted to exclude effects from the Nocibé Business, our Adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2014/2015 increased by €27.2 million, or 25.9% as compared to the first half of 2013/2014. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 11.2% for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2015, representing a margin increase of 0.9%-point over a half year period. In addition, as a result of our continuous efforts to further enhance our operational excellence, we also improved our cash conversion (defined as the difference of Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA, in each case for the respective time period) from 62.9% in the financial year 2011/2012 to 75.0% in the financial year 2012/2013 and 75.6% in the financial year 2013/2014 (all figures on a combined basis). In the twelvemonth period ended March 31, 2015, our cash conversion improved further to 75.9%. We have a long and proven track record of executing acquisitions, including both large-scale acquisitions, such as the Nocibé Acquisition, as well as a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions of individual perfumeries or perfumery chains, e.g., Himmer in Germany or Clin d’Oeil, with 43 perfumeries in France (in December 2014 and February 2015, respectively). Through the Nocibé Acquisition in June 2014, we substantially strengthened our market position in Europe, particularly in France, and expect further synergies from the integration of Nocibé, such as the sharing of best practices regarding private label excellence, standardized category management and store productivity optimization, and to benefit from economies of scale and scalability (e.g., in negotiations with suppliers). In selected cases, we also entered into joint ventures and co-operations, such as the multi-channel co-operation with Thor Hauge in Norway in November 2014.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In Germany, with an estimated market volume of €2.44 billion in 2013, we are the clear market leader in the selective beauty market in terms of sales with respect to both stationary and e-commerce business. In France, with an estimated market volume of €3.05 billion in 2013, we established the No. 2 position, extending to stationary and ecommerce business alike, through the strategic acquisition of the Nocibé Group, becoming the selective beauty retailer with the largest store network in the country. We also hold leading market positions (top 1-3) in all of our other core markets (which include the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Austria) and believe that we have strong positions in most of our other markets. In addition, we believe that we have a particularly strong competitive position in the strongly growing Central and Eastern European market, pioneering the selective perfumery business model in an extensive manner. In the financial year 2013/2014, we generated over 85% of our sales, on a pro forma basis, in countries where we rank first or second by market share (market shares based on sales for the calendar year 2013, according to the OC&C Report). By leveraging our purchasing power resulting from our growing store network and increasing sales, we aim to constantly improve our purchasing terms and to negotiate further specific price reductions (such as higher year-end discounts). Suppliers value our unique scale as European market leader (source for European leadership: OC&C, based on 2013 net sales) and our pan-European presence, and we believe, as a result, that we are the retailer of choice for the established brands and for many new brands wishing to explore their market potential at an early stage. In particular, we cooperate with all major suppliers of selective beauty products to introduce new beauty-related categories and innovative products and services to the European beauty market. Smaller competitors that are in many instances focused on narrow regional markets also often have less financial resources and are limited in their marketing power. We continue to gradually expand our geographical footprint through franchising, select acquisitions and partnerships, and we have a proven track record of integrating new stores, including those acquired from third parties and formerly franchised stores, in our network efficiently and quickly thanks to our flexible store format and brand architecture. We generally rebrand acquired stores as Douglas perfumeries only if beneficial for their performance while also maintaining a portfolio of smaller brands. We have built and continue to build a strong platform through acquisitions, including not only the Nocibé Acquisition but also smaller bolt-on acquisitions such as Himmer in Germany and Clin d’Oeil in France both of which have been recently acquired. With respect to the Nocibé business, we consider its integration and the realization of synergies to be well on track, having realized initial synergies in financial year 2013/2014. We expect a mutual sharing of best practices of the Douglas Group and Nocibé Group to further enhance our competitiveness. While the Nocibé Group already had an efficient cost structure, it can benefit from Douglas’ economies of scale, in particular improved purchasing terms and conditions. In turn, the Douglas Group can benefit from the Nocibé Group’s expertise and experience relating to a more centralized business model and efficient overhead management. With our anchor brand “Douglas”, we can build upon a strong brand heritage since the opening of the first Douglas perfumery in 1910 in Hamburg with excellent prompted and unprompted brand awareness (according to surveys carried out on behalf of our Group by the Innofact AG in December 2014/January 2015 for Germany and in December 2013/January 2014 for our other core countries, together the “Innofact survey”) in all of our core markets with the exception of France.

Another focus lies on enhancing the service experience for our customers along all customer touch points as a key differentiating factor as compared to our competitors. To further improve our operational excellence, we plan to further strengthen best practice sharing across countries and channels. Within the e-commerce channel, an important goal is to further optimize our e-commerce platform to improve customer attraction, and in particular conversion and retention rates, for example through the implementation of new features and selected new services.

In particular, it is our strategic goal to reach or further strengthen No.1 or No.2 market positions in all of our core markets in which we operate.

A particular focus in relation to our intended further expansion is on Germany, France and Poland, where a white spot analysis confirmed strong expansion potential. In addition, we continue to consider selected acquisitions of franchisees, particularly in France. Still, we strive to maintain discipline in our growth strategy and review our store portfolio on an on-going basis. We have a dedicated team responsible for reviewing our existing store network, managing lease negotiations and evaluating strategic entries into new geographic markets, as well as the opening of new stores and the potential closure of underperforming stores or markets. Generally, we consider opening a new store only if it can be opened in an attractive prime location at an appropriate cost. We investigate the demographics of a prospective location to ensure access to our target customers, while taking into account the expected impact of the opening on the sales of our existing stores in the surrounding area. Furthermore, we have identified additional attractive markets where we determined promising roll-out and consolidation opportunities either due to market size or market dynamics.

Potential target markets include Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland and select attractive regions outside of Europe such as the Middle East.

This has been a key driver for the recent margin improvements, but we believe that further upside remains. In Germany, we focus on further transforming our formerly rather decentralized business model into an effective, centrally-steered organization ready for future growth. In France, we aim to leverage on Nocibé’s already highly systematized operating model and, as part of the continued integration effort, bring the store productivity of our former Douglas stores up to Nocibé level. We believe that this focused approach will act as a blueprint for the continuous improvement of operational excellence in all other countries in which we operate in order to realize the significant potential from the migration from a decentralized to a systemized scalable business model. Another important goal is to further centralize specific marketing and customer relationship management activities either on a regional or pan-European level. This includes marketing activities such as consistent nationwide promotions and campaigns and strengthened best-practice sharing between countries. Also, we aim to further professionalize our media spending and the roll-out of new products across countries and regions.

Therefore, we intend to further systematize our trend-scouting process with the goal to reliably identify the latest beauty and personal care related trends as well as the most attractive product innovations, and thereby methodically eliminate any remaining “white spots” in our assortment in our core categories (fragrances, color cosmetics and skin care). Also, we intend to grow our sales by introducing new and complimentary product sub-categories beyond the traditional fragrance, color cosmetics and skin care products (e.g., the “Professional Beauty” category which includes _inter alia electrical skin cleaning brushes)._ Furthermore, we consider innovative service offerings, such as the recently implemented Pantone-based Douglas Color Expert, another important factor to enhancing our customers’ shopping experience, and we intend to continue our strategy of prompt implementation of such innovations. Also with respect to our goal to enhance the ----- shopping experience in our stationary stores and benefitting from our multi-channel capabilities, we intend to further optimize our product assortment physically available in our stationary stores, focusing more depth and less breadth. To improve our gross margin and to further differentiate ourselves vis-à-vis competitors, in addition to our offering of exclusive products, we aim to expand our private label offering as one of the most important pillars of our strategy. Based on Nocibé’s experience, we believe that a compelling private label offering will help us to rejuvenate our brand image, attract new, younger customers, further drive customer loyalty and act as an additional margin driver. We intend to systematically leverage the experience gained from the recently acquired Nocibé Business in France to rejuvenate and harmonize the look and feel of our private label portfolio offering and strengthen the roll-out of existing lines across all countries. We are also planning to introduce new lines and accelerate innovation cycles. In this respect, we have recently launched Nocibé’s comprehensive private label make-up range, “Black,” under the “Douglas” brand, which, after roll-out in March 2015 in eleven countries, is expected to become available in all countries in which we operate during the course of 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The vast majority of our sales in this category are generated by women’s skin care products in general and women’s face care products in particular. Men’s skin care products have gained importance and we expect this trend to continue due to the more pronounced awareness of men regarding their personal appearance. A further trend relates to increasing product differentiation, such as natural cosmetics or hybrid, multi-benefit skin care products (e.g. products combining the benefits of skin care and make-up into one). Our portfolio includes products from the established beauty brands, premium and luxury skin care brands, for instance Biotherm, Clarins, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Kanebo, La Prairie and Shiseido, designer skin care and skin expert brands, brands specialized in wellness/natural products and some masstige and mass brands.

As part of our selective product offering, we market a full range of fragrances, color cosmetics and skin care products with a wide array of major national and international brands. Our historical strength within our selective products offering has been, and we believe will continue to be, fragrances. The distribution of selective products is limited to selected retailers which have to meet specific qualitative and quantitative criteria. For more information, see “—Operations: Suppliers and _Supply Chain Management, Logistics, and Information Technology—Suppliers and Supply Chain Management—Suppliers”._ We believe that the top brand suppliers consider us as an important strategic partner in the European selective beauty retail markets in which we operate, particularly in our key markets of Germany and France. We also believe that our core strength lies in the fact that we offer a broad and comprehensive assortment of selective products of different brands through a dense network of stores as well as online. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Exclusive products are an important source of differentiation vis-à-vis competitors and we believe that the “Douglas” brand is particularly strong in this respect. Exclusive products typically have higher margins than other selective products while also contributing to increase customer loyalty. In the financial year 2013/2014, exclusive products accounted for 15.1% of our total sales attributable to the Douglas Perfumeries Business (figures excluding Croatia, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Latvia; adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Nocibé Acquisition in the period July to September 2014). In Germany and France alone, our exclusive offering includes approximately 50 brands that range across all of our product categories, and in Germany, we exclusively offer products from more than 40 different brands. In addition, Nocibé’s exclusive offering in France comprises products from more than ten brands. For example, in Germany, we exclusively offer fragrances and color cosmetics by Michael Kors such as the fragrance “Sexy Amber” which only a few weeks after its launch ranked among our best-selling fragrances, as well as certain other fragrances, such as “That’s me” by Helene Fischer, “Stella” by Stella McCartney and several fragrances by Toni Gard. Furthermore, in Germany, certain color cosmetics by ANNY, Beyu, Isadora and NYX, as well as certain skin care products by Annayake, Artemis, Eisenberg and Rexaline are exclusively sold by Douglas. Exclusivity is typically granted for one or two years, in particular for newer brands, in order to be able to retain flexibility, and a somewhat longer period (for example, three years) in the case of certain exclusive products of well-established brands. In many other respects, including the sourcing process, exclusive products are similar to the other selective products and are often provided by some of the same suppliers. We typically share part of the marketing costs for such products with the supplier and receive attractive tester/sample packages relating to the respective exclusive products. Potential exclusive partners typically value the possibility to co-operate and further develop their brand with us as their exclusive partner due to our leading market positions in many of the countries in which we operate and due to the advantages of having a single distribution channel. Our exclusive products are selected on the basis of a trend scouting process and a related brand assessment that analyzes whether a potential new exclusive product fits well within our brand and assortment strategy. We are both receptive to proposals from the products’ suppliers and approach suppliers pro-actively when we identify a product or type of product that we consider to be attractive to offer on an exclusivity basis. Among the criteria that we consider when assessing potential exclusive products are the brand awareness, estimated sales and margin prospects, differentiation from competitors, the potential to attract new customers or reinforce the loyalty of existing customers and the period for which exclusivity is granted. In some cases, exclusive products are distributed only through our ecommerce platform. This allows us to test how a product performs before extending the partnership to our stationary stores.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,2407,MARKET AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT,2407.34,Product Types,2407.34.3,Private Label Products,"Our private label products, which focus on color cosmetics, skin care and accessories, are positioned in the entry-level segment and generally priced below comparable selective products. Such pricing increases the affordability of the products that we sell as a whole and we believe this improves the Douglas and Nocibé brands’ price/value perception among consumers. We believe private label products also help increase store traffic, and are more “trend-oriented” targeting, in particular, new and younger customers, thereby rejuvenating and broadening our target customer base and image. Given higher gross margins related to private label products, our private label offering also improves our average margins. In the financial year 2013/2014, when adjusted to combine the Nocibé Business and the Douglas Perfumeries Business, private label products accounted for 2.8% of our total aggregated sales (all figures on a combined basis; adjusted to include the Nocibé Business for the whole financial year 2013/2014). While we do not manufacture or develop any products ourselves, we co-operate with manufacturers and suppliers of our private label products, who, in some cases manufacture the product exclusively for us. In this regard, we typically approach our private label suppliers with a concept based on the results of our trend scouting and also work with design agencies regarding, for example, packaging. We offer a range of private labels that are both country-specific and international. In France, Nocibé reaunched its private label products in April 2012. These include a broad range of color cosmetics (make-up), combined with skin care and toiletry products and accessories. In this field, Nocibé has demonstrated differentiation and increased margin potential from developing a strong private label offering and generated a significantly larger share of its sales from private label products compared to the Douglas Perfumeries Business. We are currently rejuvenating and selectively ----- expanding our private label portfolio and are beginning to harmonize our private label offerings across countries by building on the combined strengths of both the “Douglas” and “Nocibé” brands. For example, we are planning to harmonize and rejuvenate the look and feel of all other Douglas skin care brands over the next few months. We source our private label products from a diversified portfolio of over 50 suppliers in Germany, France, Italy and Asia, in order to facilitate price benchmarking and assist with negotiations. Generally, we engage the same suppliers as the large established beauty brands to ensure the required product quality. Before selecting a supplier for a new private label product, we compare the price and quality of product of at least two potential suppliers. Our sourcing is based on an order-by-order concept, where we select our suppliers and enter into individual contracts for each private label product or product line. Such contracts are usually entered into for an indefinite period and may typically be terminated with six-months’ notice. Our sourcing contracts set demanding standards and incorporate provisions that require the supplier to comply with applicable laws and carry out certain tests relating to product safety (for example, suppliers may be required to carry out tests relating to the stability of a given recipe within an inert receptacle and the compatibility of the content with the receptacle) while other tests are carried out by our own product managers in co-operation with a third-party testing facility (for example, as to dermatological compatibility and to avoid detrimental skin reactions). In addition, depending on the designated specification of the product, we may demand further tests be executed by the respective suppliers and/or third-party testing facilities, for example to measure how effective products are (e.g., the moisturizing qualities of a product) and regarding the product’s response to transportation, and have processes in place to ensure appropriate product labeling. We currently implement a process to audit all new private label suppliers and existing suppliers every two years as well as, in case of repeated non-conforming products or other difficulties, as required. We also apply strict quality standards to our private label products and notwithstanding their lower average price points, our private label products generally have significantly higher gross margins than selective or exclusive products because of lower sourcing costs making them highly attractive.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

This strategy allows us to address the different demands of our customers with a representative product assortment in the stores and a broader assortment online. As a result of our cross-channel capabilities, our online product portfolio is accessible for our store personnel who can order products physically unavailable in the relevant store and have them delivered either to the store or directly to the customer. Our stationary assortment concept is based on a modular store system including dedicated concepts for small, medium-sized and large stores, which allows for a high degree of automation in supply management (with benefits such as the automation of replenishment of stock, less resource used ordering out-of-stock products of our permanent portfolio in the individual stores and less stock-outs), yet includes enough flexibility to cater to the specific needs of certain stores. The three main assortment modules are based on luxury, mainstream and trend concepts, each with different breadth levels for large, medium and small stores. There are also complementary assortment modules, for example, for product lines of experimental organic cosmetics, which the individual stores can incorporate pursuant to agreed rules (e.g., only the full module of products can be incorporated, not just individual products from complementary modules). This centrally managed assortment strategy also includes the management of so-called “fast turners”, which are products with high turnover rates, as well as “slow movers”, which are products with low turnover rates, across stores, including ----- supporting processes such as limit and stock planning, mark-up and sale of old stock, as well as a centralized selection process regarding additions to our product portfolio. We see ourselves as an innovation leader in the beauty and personal care industry, introducing many of the latest trends and new products into the European selective market for beauty and personal care products. In addition to the introduction of new products, we constantly aim to further develop and enhance our beauty and customer services offering in our stores as well as online. Due to the complexity of, and the dynamic changes in, the global beauty market, we have established an international competence center, where we have concentrated our corresponding expertise, essential for discovering and evaluating the latest customer trends and needs in the context of the overall beauty and lifestyle environment. We have a dedicated trend scouting team which constantly assesses new innovative brands and products and also cooperates with a global trend scouting agency. Recent examples regarding selective products include the introduction of the “eos—evolution of smooth”, a lip balm enriched with natural conditioning oils, moisturizing shea butter and antioxidant vitamins, for which we acquired exclusive rights for Germany in June 2014, launched comprehensive public relations campaigns in September 2014 and sold the first products in our stores in November 2014.

As of March 31, 2015, approximately 60% of our stores were located in Germany (436 stores) and France and Monaco (496 stores, excluding 137 franchised stores), ----- with a strong presence in Italy, Poland and the Netherlands. We target highly frequented locations for our stores such as city centers and shopping malls. More than 50% of our stores were located in city centers as of March 31, 2015. In terms of geographical spread, we operate in a vast number of European cities, primarily in urban locations and have nationwide coverage in our key markets of Germany and France—the largest selective beauty markets in Europe. In France, our presence, now channeled through our Nocibé branded stores, given that the vast majority of Douglas stores have already been re-branded following the acquisition of the Nocibé Group, is concentrated in the North and East of France, and we have a lesser presence in the Paris city center compared to our competitors, where we have identified a number of white spots supporting a further expansion. The size of the selling surface of our stores (both Douglas-branded and Nocibé-branded stores) typically ranges between around 100 m[2] and around 250 m[2] with an average store size of approximately 220 m[2]. However, we also operate select stores with less than 100 m[2] and well above 300 m[2] of selling surface, with our largest store having a selling area of approximately 3,000 m[2]. A typical store offers approximately 10,000 to 15,000 SKUs. We also operate several franchised stores, primarily in France, but also in the Netherlands. While our franchisees operate between one and seven stores (with the exception of one franchisee operating 15 stores), as of March 31, 2015, about half of our franchisees owned only one store. We consider our franchise network as being complementary to our own stores. For example in France, the franchised stores complement our network of owned stores to ensure a nationwide footprint. We frequently make use of the franchise model when entering a new country, as was recently the case in Norway with our multi-channel franchise co-operation with Thor Hauge. The standard length of a franchise contract is five years, typically including a renewal clause for our benefit. Our franchise contracts grant the franchisee the right to operate a store using the Nocibé store brand (in France) and the Douglas brand (in the other countries). The franchisees in France have their own purchasing processes with suppliers under the commercial conditions negotiated by the franchisor and—except for private label and certain exclusive products—we do not sell any products to them; however, in other countries, we do supply our franchisees with other selective products. We normally provide certain commercial and marketing assistance to our franchisees (such as coordinating store window displays during the Christmas or Mother’s Day period). Most of our franchise contracts provide us with preemption rights to purchase the store in case a sale is envisaged by the franchisee. The criteria that we consider when deciding whether to purchase a franchised store or not includes the sales of such store, store location, the number of customers and the length of time that the store has been our franchise. We review our store portfolio on an on-going basis in order to systematically enhance our network of stores. During the period from October 1, 2011 to March 31, 2015, we added 394 own stores to our network on a net basis (including 373 stores that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Nocibé Group; other stores were acquired in the context of smaller bolt-on acquisitions of individual perfumeries or perfumery chains, such as the 5 Himmer perfumeries in Germany (in December 2014) or the 43 Clin d’Oeil perfumeries acquired in February 2015 in France (of which seven perfumeries are required to be divested to comply with national and EU competition law), which we now operate under the Nocibé brand). Further to the acquisition of Nocibé and other stores, the net increase of 394 stores resulted from 104 new store openings and the closure of 131 stores. We strive to continuously improve our store network by implementing a number of operational and strategic initiatives to increase store productivity and like-for-like sales. In the recent past, such initiatives included the introduction of a new visual identity, continuous improvement of the in-store offerings, roll-out of new product displays, improvement of visual merchandizing and marketing concepts, the usage of more professional space management and best practice sharing across the countries in which we operate. In particular, in 2013, we developed and began the rollout of a new brand design with a new visual identity to achieve a new and rejuvenated brand image. In addition, we recently developed a new store concept that we believe even better reflects the specific demands of a young, modern and trendy, urban customer group, for example through a more contemporary shop design, as well as state-of-the-art digital merchandizing. In November 2014, we successfully launched this new store concept in two test stores in Warsaw, Poland, and Düsseldorf, Germany. Both stores showed significantly increased customer traffic and sales as compared to the same period prior to the re-fitting. For example, the newly re-fitted test store in Düsseldorf, Germany, has shown a sales uplift since the re-fitting of more than 25% (analysis based on a week-by-week comparison of seventeen-week periods pre and post refurbishment, i.e., calendar week 46 in 2013 to calendar week 63 in 2014 against calendar week 46 in 2014 to calendar week 63 in 2015). We plan to implement aspects of the new store concept into our store network across Europe when opening new stores and also as part of our regularly scheduled store refurbishments. On average, we perform smaller facelifts and/or maintenance measures every two to four years and larger refurbishments every six to nine years per store. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

For a description of our two-fold strategy regarding product assortment, see “—Product Offering and Assortment Strategy—Assortment Strategy”. As of March 31, 2015, our German online shop, available under “douglas.de”, offered up to 35,000 different SKUs from more than 1,400 brands. In Germany, our e-commerce and multi-channel customers are on average younger than our store-only customers (based on an analysis of our Douglas Card customers). In the financial year 2013/2014, our German ecommerce business exceeded a customer retention rate of 80%; the average order size was slightly below €60 and the order frequency was around 2.5 orders per financial year per customer.

In our stores across Europe, customers can generally choose among payment in cash, with credit or debit card or with gift cards and in Germany and Austria also with their Douglas card. In addition, we also offer mobile payment services via Yapital or our digitized Douglas card (embedded in our mobile Douglas App) in Germany. Our e-commerce platform offers a variety of payment methods. While, for example, customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland often pay by invoice (i.e., they receive an invoice together with the delivered products, which is then paid by bank transfer; in Germany, in the financial year 2013/2014 approximately one third of our e-commerce sales were paid on invoice), most customers in France prefer to use credit cards for their payments. Customers in Italy prefer to pay cash-on-delivery, ----- while customers in the Netherlands often use a local payment option called iDEAL (i.e., direct online transfer from a bank account). As a result, our payment methods include, invoicing, credit and debit cards, PayPal, direct deposit, online bank transfer pursuant to the electronic payment standard, direct debit, checks, the Douglas card and gift cards. We offer these methods free of charge (other than charging a small annual fee for the Douglas card, which has a payment function). We believe that offering a wide array of payment methods according to local preferences enhances customer satisfaction and improves our check-out conversion with respect to our e-commerce sales (that is, the rate of customers who complete the check-out process after selecting products to buy from our websites and effectively pay for a product). Certain online shops also offer customers the option of currency choice, enabling them to pay in their local or another preferred currency. We also have tax free co-operations for Non-EU-residents shopping in the EU, such as Global Blue, China Union Pay, and JCB (for Japanese residents), who can obtain a refund of VAT paid. As we take on credit risk associated with certain payment methods, we have implemented risk management systems to contribute to a reduction of the exposure to such risks, including fraud. For example, we are in the process of introducing a new activation feature in our Douglas card to improve its safety and avoid abuse risks, for example in case of theft or loss during transportation of new cards before the card reaches the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from competitors through our emotional, innovative and customer-centric approach. We believe some of our competitors focus more on price, such as Marionnaud, are less specialized, such as Müller, or are less receptive of the individual customer’s needs. In France and Monaco, we use the strong Nocibé brand (>600 stores); following the acquisition of Nocibé we are rebranding our existing Douglas stores in these countries to “Nocibé”. As of the date of this offering memorandum, only a few remaining stores in France still operate under the “Douglas” brand, with the brand switch ongoing. We currently concentrate our e-commerce activities under the Douglas brand (and Nocibé in France and Monaco). In addition to the Douglas and the Nocibé brand, we use some smaller (sub-)brands as local company symbols to differentiate our offering and address different target groups, for example, Schnitzler (targeting luxury, high-end customers with three stores in Düsseldorf, Germany), HELA (targeting more price-sensitive customers with nine stores regionally focused in Southern Germany, particularly in Munich, Germany; also the five Himmer stores acquired are to be rebranded as HELA stores), Les Bellista by Nocibé (targeting trendy, younger customers with three locations in France and more recently a location in Germany), Sarma in Lithuania (17 stores) and Beautyzone in Bulgaria (11 stores).

In the financial year 2013/2014, our total gross marketing costs amounted to €110.3 million representing 5.3% of our sales (figures for the financial year 2013/2014 adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Nocibé Acquisition in the period July to September 2014, i.e., only relating to the Douglas Perfumeries Business). The largest portion of our gross marketing costs is financed by the brand manufacturers that supply their selective products to us in the form of so-called “market development funds”, which significantly enhance our ability to advertise across classic channels, such as press (e.g., advertisements in women’s magazines), TV, radio and similar methods. In addition, we use newer media channels, including social media channels such as Facebook (with more than one million fans as of March 31, 2015), Instagram, Google+, Pinterest and YouTube and our own beauty blog (the German version of which is available under “http://blog.douglas.de”) to support traffic to our stores and attract new customers, both for our stationary and our e-commerce business. Our multi-channel communication strategy furthermore includes in-store communication and joint advertising with suppliers. Moreover, we have a partner program in place, under which operators of third-party websites that become part of the program receive access to various of our advertising and promotion tools (for example, banners, text links and similar), which the partners may then select to suit their target group and integrate as part of their own websites. Partners receive a commission when their users use the links to our online shop and complete an order (less cancellations and returns).

In this regard, we view our customer service as an important part of our strategy, as it provides direct feedback from our customer base and helps to interpret customers’ satisfaction with our products and service and customers’ needs. A systematic customer lifecycle management with dedicated measures to first win new customers, secondly activate, retain and develop existing customers, and, if necessary, re-activate and win back former customers is at the heart of our customer relationship management strategy. As an important tool in our customer lifecycle management, we have an extensive industry-leading customer loyalty card program in place, with approximately 18 million loyalty card holders, including approximately 10 million “Douglas” card holders in 16 countries across Europe (2.8 million Douglas card holders in Germany, 2.2 million holders in Italy, 1.3 million holders in Poland, 1.1 million holders in the Netherlands, 0.2 million holders in Austria and 2.2 million holders in other countries) and around 8 million “Nocibé” card holders in France and Monaco (Monaco having a more sophisticated offering) as of March 31, 2015. The Nocibé Group operates three distinct variants of its loyalty card, including one which aims at younger customers and another which aims at their highest spending customers. The average usage of our customer loyalty cards varies between countries, for example, in the financial year 2013/2014 less than one-third of our sales in Germany were conducted on loyalty cards, whereas in France the share was significantly higher. The “Douglas magazine”, which is primarily available to Douglas card holders (with variations among countries; e.g., in certain countries to active customers, and in other countries also to some extent to inactive or noncustomers) across Europe, has a total circulation of around 4.8 million copies, including 2.6 million copies in Germany alone, thus exceeding the reach of many leading German beauty and fashion magazines, and circulations typically ranging between 40,000 and 600,000 copies in the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, Romania, Lithuania, Croatia, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Douglas and Nocibé card holders also receive special and personalized offers via a broad spectrum of channels (including mailings and text messages). In order to further expand the reach of our loyalty card program, we have introduced a mobile Douglas card in Germany which in connecting with the Douglas mobile application incorporates an in-store payment function via smartphone as well as additional features, such as couponing and purchase history functionality. We are currently evaluating options to extend our card program through the introduction of a “top”, a “light” and a “teen” loyalty card in the near future. Based on an analysis regarding sales via our German Douglas Card customers, we believe that loyalty card holders are particularly attractive customers, as the average ticket volume of our German Douglas Card customers grew significantly more in the past three financial years as compared to our German non-loyalty card customers. Furthermore, in the financial year 2013/2014, our German Douglas Card customers spend on average approximately 20% more per purchase at our stationary stores than our German non-loyalty card customers. Our customer relationship management in Germany (which we handle internally and also serves our customers in Switzerland) includes a free-of-charge telephone hotline, which also takes orders placed by customers via telephone, as well as e-mail and postal correspondence with customers, postings and answers to postings in social media platforms and customer care in connection with our loyalty programs. In the other countries in which we are present, we also offer dedicated hotlines (in some cases free of charge), which mainly address queries about our loyalty program/bonus points, our online shops, questions about orders, customer complaints and similar.

Additionally, given the short payment terms of our sales, we have a low level of receivables and bad debt expense. Women have traditionally been, and continue to be, by a large margin the gender with the largest spending for beauty and personal care products, and women tend to be the decision makers in terms of overall family health and beauty spending, in addition to buying products for themselves. Thus, we consider women as our most important customer group. However, men are increasingly dedicating more time to, and spending more money on, their personal ----- appearance. As a result, men have also become an important target group of ours that we address through a dedicated space in our store layout as well as special product offerings such as the “Douglas Men” series. Based on a customer survey conducted for Germany by Innofact AG in October/November 2014 and analyzed by OC&C, the average age of our German customers is 43 (for stationary store purchases only, i.e., excluding ecommerce activities) with a relatively even spread between different age groups. Our Douglas card-customers tend to be slightly older than our average customer and prefer the shopping experience in our retail stores over online/mobileshopping. Customers that use both or retail store and e-commerce platform channels for their purchases spend, on average, more than twice as much per annum compared to customers that use primarily one such sales channel. Our strong brand, broad and deep product offerings and focus on personalized and professional customer service have created a very satisfied, loyal customer base, regarding both our store-based as well as our e-commerce business.

Taking Germany as an example, our top ten suppliers of selective products accounted for more than two thirds of our total purchasing volume in the financial year 2013/2014. Our Top40 suppliers accounted for approximately 90% of our total purchasing volume in Germany in the financial year 2013/2014. With respect to selective products, we basically enter into three different types of contracts with our suppliers, namely selective distribution contracts, international framework and local supply trading agreements: - Firstly, we enter into often long-term selective distribution contracts (or authorized retail agreements) with suppliers of selective beauty products, under which we are, on a country-by-country basis, authorized by such suppliers to distribute products belonging to a particular brand both in our stores and online provided that certain quality standards and other criteria are met. Selective distribution contracts typically run for multiple years with some contracts having terms of up to ten years. By means of these agreements, which form the basis of our business model, brand manufacturers aim at ensuring an appropriate premium sales environment for their brands, for example by requiring an adequate product and brand presentation in stores, ensuring appropriate service levels through qualified and trained employees as well as breadth of product assortment (i.e., the obligation to carry the entire product line rather than “cherry picking” only the most popular products) and testing opportunities. Selective distribution is thus a key instrument for suppliers to protect the exclusivity of their brands. In general terms, different stages of fulfillment of the different requirements lead to different levels of brand usage rights. For more information, see “Market and Competitive Environment—The European Selective _Beauty Market—Definition of the European Selective Beauty Market; Key Characteristics”._ - Secondly, we enter into yearly international framework trading agreements, in particular with our top sixteen suppliers, which contain the basic commercial agreement between us and the relevant supplier, setting forth the general terms of sale, in particular regarding invoice conditions, bonus payment terms, promotional activities and marketing development allowances granted to us by the supplier, general logistic conditions as well as the conditions for returning goods (e.g., of products that become de-listed by the supplier). The terms are generally negotiated every year on a case-by-case basis (whereby the contracts as such are typically automatically extended for a further annual term unless terminated with three-month’s notice). These international framework trading agreements form the basis for the local trading agreements entered into for each country or specific countries in which we sell the respective products. - Lastly, annual local trading agreements transpose the basic commercial agreement contained in the international framework trading agreements for each country or specific countries (due to the relevance of the individual market situation in each country, e.g., the different market position of each brand ----- within such market) and set forth the specific terms of sale, details of marketing efforts and bonuses/discounts, merchandising (e.g., additional payments for a prominent placement of a product in one or more stores) and other similar terms. The local trading agreements are typically entered into with the suppliers’ local distribution subsidiaries and are governed by the respective national law. In addition, these contracts govern the product supply of our respective local online shops, if applicable. With suppliers other than our top 16 suppliers, we only enter into local supply contracts. We aim to constantly improve our purchasing terms and to negotiate further specific price reductions (such as, higher year-end discounts) by leveraging our bargaining power resulting from our growing store network and increasing sales. Depending on the nature of the price reduction, the discount can be either a discount “on the invoice” by the supplier, a year-end bonus tied to certain sales targets or cash discounts for early payment. Some agreements also provide for cost sharing provisions under which the respective supplier participates in certain costs (for example, personnel or installation costs). We also aim to increase marketing-related investments (which are industry-typical, socalled “market development funds”) from suppliers that support customer demand for their products, such as the cofinancing of promotions (including specific incentives or “challenges” to our sales force as well as dedicated budgets for temporary promotional price reductions), co-advertising, in-store promotions, customer mailings and product placements in the Douglas magazine. This is particularly important for any product launches, where we typically incur higher promotion-related costs. Generally, payments for marketing-related investments are paid out after the implementation of the respective advertising measures. Furthermore, in some cases, suppliers are provided with sales figures and/or other data with regard to the suppliers’ products and customers of those products. In consideration thereof, we are, for example, granted additional bonuses. In the last two years, we negotiated Europe-wide framework trading agreements with several of our top suppliers in order to secure consistent margins, standardize terms and conditions streamline and allow for an efficient centralized contract management. We strive to expand this practice to other sourcing activities, including the procurement of personal care products and accessories. In addition, we have implemented a suppliers’ code of conduct which has the objective of ensuring compliance with relevant social and environmental standards. Our suppliers’ code is based on the Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Our suppliers’ compliance is verified at the initial stage of the business relationship and also, in the case of existing business relationships, on a regular basis and at any time without prior announcement. Generally, only those companies are accepted as partners which comply with the standards set out in our suppliers’ code, or which at least strive for and ensure compliance within the specified time period. _Supply Chain and Product Portfolio Management_ We manage our supply chain through an integrated information flow system. In the financial year 2009/2010, we rolled out the automated demand forecast tool SAF by SAP, which enables us to optimize merchandise inventories in our German stores. We subsequently introduced SAF in other countries such as Switzerland, Austria (both in 2012), the Netherlands and Italy (both in 2013). Since then, we have significantly reduced stock-outs and the high electronic data interchange penetration with almost full coverage in Germany facilitates order and invoice information exchange and further streamlines the automated replenishment process. We started to pilot the SAF program in Poland in 2015. In recent years, we successfully introduced a number of measures to improve our supply chain management. In particular, we implemented standardized processes for our product portfolio, product inventory, order and product liquidation planning and controlling. The new concept consists of binding limit planning regarding our stock, a modular-based product portfolio compilation with clearly defined competencies and destocking of surplus products to streamline our portfolio, particularly in-store. Our goal is to eliminate the need for manual adjustments of our supply management and order process and rather operate with fully automated processes that require minimal human intervention. Through these measures we have significantly reduced out-of-stocks. Also, the high electronic data interchange penetration facilitates order and invoice information exchanges with our suppliers. We carefully manage our inventory with a strong focus on identifying the most relevant brands for our discerning customers and maintaining an attractive overall inventory “age” profile. Thereby, we follow an approach strictly driven by our defined key performance indicators, tightly monitoring inventory turnover and out-of-stock products. The centralized supply chain management department is also responsible for most strategic issues with regard to our logistics infrastructure. For example, it analyzes whether a certain location is appropriate for purposes of establishing a central warehouse or cross-docking center. Also, we employ a modern, uniform IT-based supply chain ----- management system from SAP across most of the countries in which we operate. The selection process for suitable transport and logistics providers is carried out by our central supply chain management team through regular tenders and on the basis of standardized guidelines regarding the terms of the agreements. The decision regarding the selection of a service provider is then taken together with the local management in the individual countries on the basis of a proposal of the central supply chain management team. We have continuously increased our efforts relating to quality assurance and now operate a strict quality management system in particular focused on the processes relating to our private label products (such as the careful selection of suppliers of our private label products, quality control of such products and handling of non-conforming products and any claims brought with respect to such products). This is complemented by quality assurance processes regarding selective and exclusive products offered by us (and, for exclusive products, we generally also control the quality with samples prior to ordering the products).",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Our cross-docking centers approach allows for high flexibility levels and quick adaptation to shifts in our supply chain (e.g., the flexibility to arrange for new contracts or to easily expand our store network). In Germany, we operate five so-called cross-docking centers where the turnaround time for goods is very short, since incoming goods are processed—first by store, and later by SKU and product category utilizing reusable packaging—and forwarded to our stores on a “just-in-time” basis. While we operate some cross-docking centers ourselves, we also co-operate with logistic partners to run the cross-docking centers or e-commerce centers (for example, our e-commerce distribution center and two cross-docking centers in Germany, our cross-docking center in Italy, Poland and the Netherlands) and ship our products to our stores and directly to our e-commerce customers whenever this represents a more cost-efficient alternative. The cross-docking approach contributes to limiting fixed costs, as it virtually eliminates the need for stock keeping and larger warehouses. Products are instead constantly restocked by our suppliers according to a sophisticated weekly schedule. Within this system, our private label and exclusive products are supplied from our private-label dedicated warehouse in Zossen, Germany. In France, we employ a different logistics concept with a central warehouse in Villeneuve d’Ascq, which prepares the packages that are delivered directly to all of the “Nocibé” stores in France (including the stores in that country that originally operated under the “Douglas” brands and which were rebranded after the Nocibé acquisition) which is supported by an external warehouse operated by a logistics provider. With regard to the other countries in which we operate, our logistics approach is generally based on crossdocking centers and in some cases we have restricted our local logistics to a distribution hub which typically acts as a repackaging and shipping location only (i.e., products are supplied to the distribution hub and then forwarded to their final destination—the individual store). We initially established our e-commerce operations, including the related logistics, as a separate organization. Our current logistics strategy with respect to e-commerce aims at centralizing the logistics for all our distribution channels. To this end, in May 2014, we opened our first combined logistics center in Oldenzaal, the Netherlands, servicing both our stationary and our e-commerce business, which allows for the optimal linkage of all our sales channels within our logistics operation. If successful, such combined logistics center can serve as the model for additional such centers we may open in the future. Our central e-commerce warehouse in Ennigerloh, Germany, which handles all logistic processes for our German e-commerce activities, is operated by an external service provider. In Germany, several services, such as shipment, the handling and processing of inbound transportation of goods (i.e., shipments from our suppliers to our warehouses), quality control, and handling and processing of outbound transportation of goods (i.e., shipments from our warehouses to our stores) are typically subcontracted to local firms, while the management of our supply chain is centralized and controlled by our integrated supply chain management software. The main transportation company that we use for shipments to our e-commerce customers within Germany is DHL, and for shipments within the French territory Chronopost, Colissimo and Relais Colis. We typically deliver to our e-commerce customers within 24-48 hours; in some cases, as a pilot project, express/same-day delivery is available. As far as our franchised stores in France are concerned, selective products are supplied by the respective distributors directly to the franchised stores, while exclusive products and our private label products are supplied to the franchised stores by us from our central warehouse in Villeneuve d’Ascq. We deliver to our own stores on average two times per week with a much higher average delivery service in peak periods.

Our IT platform allows us to track the sale of each individual product across all brands and all channels (internet, mobile or stationary stores). We have begun integrating formerly separated customer data from our online shops into our centralized customer relationship management system to allow for targeted marketing campaigns and customer analysis across all channels. We believe that our comprehensive IT platform enables us to be efficient and reactive to changes in demand and to respond in a timely manner to shifts in consumer preferences. We consider it as vital to maintain and continuously expand our internal know-how in order to remain independent from third party operators. Our IT platform is primarily based on centrally hosted and harmonized enterprise resource planning systems running on SAP software. Several different SAP modules and related process templates are customized to fit requirements of the stationary and online-based perfumeries business. The enterprise resource planning systems are linked with a variety of additional IT systems, such as our data warehouse (based on an IBM data base solution) or our e-commerce platform (based on the well-established “hybris” software by SAP). The integrated IT system landscape can therefore support relevant processes and deliver information that is important to us as a multi-channel retailer, enabling capabilities such as “click-and-collect”, online inventory information, promotion management or online couponing. We first rolled out the demand forecast tool SAF by SAP, which enables the optimization of merchandise inventories in stores, in Germany in the financial year 2009/2010, and then subsequently in other countries, such as Switzerland and Austria in 2012, the Netherlands and Italy in 2013 and the first pilots in Poland in 2015. (see “—Suppliers and Supply _Chain Management—Supply Chain Management”)._ Furthermore, we use “MicroStrategy”, a predictive analytics software tool interfaced with our data warehouse solution. We maintain two independent IT centers, one at our headquarters in Hagen, Germany, and a second in Dortmund, Germany, which significantly mitigates the risks relating to a potential failure of our IT platform. Another data center for our French organization is hosted at Nocibé’s headquarters in Villeneuve d’Ascq, France. Our centrally managed online shops (Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Italy and Switzerland, and until recently the since discontinued Douglas online shop in France) are hosted under an outsourcing arrangement by a third party based in Stuttgart, Germany.

We have, for example, a cash register management system in place in our stationary stores, which directly links any new purchases to the profiles that we keep of our most loyal customers and which is also linked to our employee incentive system. As part of our Business Continuous Management (BCM), the IT infrastructure in our retail stores, in particular our cash register system, has full offline capability, allowing for an uninterrupted service even if the uplink to our IT center is lost, e.g., due to damage to the copper or fiber optic lines for broadband data connections; there are only a limited number of exceptions, such as up-/ unload of Douglas e-vouchers, where we provide secure manual, technical and organizational back-up processes. We believe the effective utilization of our IT platform and centralized big data solution is integral to our business as these enable the optimization and educated decision-making across our organization and facilitates the interconnectedness of our business model across all channels, stationary, online and mobile. We maintain sophisticated tools for gathering large amounts of data generated through our customers’ browsing and shopping patterns in our online shops and on mobile applications. We then analyze this data and optimize a large array of business functions, including anticipating our customers’ future shopping preferences, optimizing payment options, stock allocation in our e-commerce and centers, and personalizing our customers’ experience.

The duration of our lease agreements is generally defined by a fixed term (typically, five or ten years), during which the lease may generally not be terminated by either party, in combination with either an extension option for us as lessee or a tacit renewal upon expiry of the fixed term. In addition to the fixed lease payments (on a monthly basis or, in some cases, every three months), many of our lease agreements contain sales-related additional variable lease payments, meaning that a portion of the lease payments is tied to the level of net or gross revenue, as the case may be, generated in the store concerned, subject to a minimum lease payment. The commercial leases that we sign with our landlords typically provide for an adjustment of the rent as a function of changes in certain indices, such as the _Verbraucherpreisindex in Germany (adjustments either be based upon pre-assigned value thresholds or occur annually),_ the Austrian Consumer Price Index in Austria, the Indice du _coût de la construction (“ICC”), in France the Indice _trimestriel des loyers commerciaux (“ILC”), in Italy an index published by the Italian National Statistics Institute_ (“ISTAT”) and in Poland the Harmonized Index for Consumer Prices (“HICP”) or other indices. In addition to rent, operating expenses and special payments such as center-contributions or marketing contributions may be payable. Before sub-letting a facility, we are generally required to request the lessor’s consent, which may be in some cases dependent on an additional rent. We regularly review our lease agreements and renegotiate their terms when possible. Certain particularities of the agreements vary from country to country and are in part dependent on the different applicable legal regimes. In Germany, for example, our lease agreements with regard to retail stores in shopping centers contain an obligation to operate a business on the leased premises (Betreiberpflicht) for the respective contractual term. Under this obligation, we must ensure that the respective retail store is opened during further specified opening times and the leased space is uninterruptedly used as a perfumery during the term of the respective agreement. Also, certain German lease agreements (but none of our current lease agreements with regard to retail stores in shopping centers) contain a provision pursuant to which we are granted a right of protection from competition, i.e., pursuant to which the respective lessor is not allowed to lease space in the same premise to other companies with the same business focus. In France, for example, regarding commercial leases governed by French law, the lessee has a right to security of tenure, which enables the lessee to ask for the renewal of the commercial lease upon its expiry. If the lessor refuses to renew the lease and to the extent the lessee is not in breach of its obligations under the lease, the lessor has to pay to the lessee an indemnity of eviction. This indemnity of eviction is a remedy for the loss suffered by the lessee as a result of the non-renewal of the lease. The indemnity of eviction is assessed on a case by case basis and entails a compensation for the decrease in the loss of the business carried out on those premises or a displacement indemnity as well as certain costs borne by the lessee. In the Netherlands, the basic assumption of the legislator is that a lease should last for at least ten years. In practice, a lease is often entered into for a period of five years with a possibility to extend the lease for a further fiveyear period. Even if no second five-year-period has been agreed to, or if the original agreement is entered into for a shorter or longer term than five years, the lease will be extended by operation of law to a term of ten years. If no notice of termination has been given at the end of the ten-year-period, the lease will subsequently continue for an indefinite period of time. ----- In Italy, most of the lease agreements are prolonged by tacit renewals on the basis of the current applicable legal regime. A portion of our store rental agreements qualify as operating leases. The lease installments under such operating leases are based on both variable and fixed rental payments.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

It is impossible to determine or predict the outcome of cases pending or threatened. Legal disputes and administrative proceedings in which our Group companies have been involved during the past twelve months, or which are currently pending or threatened, mainly relate to employment matters, intellectual property, advertising or distribution practices, leases, and the adequacy of the squeeze-out compensation. The Company believes that other than the proceedings described below, during a period covering the previous twelve months, no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Company is aware) may have or have had in the recent past significant effects on the Company’s and our financial position or profitability. Following the squeeze-out which became effective in July 2013, pursuant to which the Company’s whollyowned subsidiary Beauty Holding Two GmbH acquired the remaining shareholding in Douglas Holding AG, 97 of the minority shareholders of Douglas Holding AG initiated appraisal proceedings (Spruchstellenverfahren) against Beauty Holding Two GmbH before the Regional Court (Landgericht) in Dortmund following registration of the squeeze-out in the commercial register (Handelsregister). At the time of the registration of the squeeze-out, 1,264,649 shares of Douglas Holding AG (approximately 3.21% of the total shares of Douglas Holding AG) were held by minority shareholders. The minority shareholders challenge the adequacy of the squeeze-out compensation stating a number of reasons. With court order dated January 20, 2014, the court consolidated all proceedings relating to this matter. On July 30, 2014, Beauty Holding Two GmbH filed a legal brief in which it replied to the minority shareholders’ challenges to the squeeze-out compensation. With court order dated August 13, 2014, the court appointed a joint representative of the shareholders that are not formally a party to the proceedings. On February 3, 2015, Beauty Holding Two GmbH filed a legal brief responding to further legal briefs of the minority shareholders and the joint representative. The court has not yet provided the parties with an opinion regarding the substance of the case. No provisions have been formed to cover any risks associated with these proceedings. We are also involved in proceedings regarding the Nocibé Group relating to concerted practices in the determination of resale price among fine perfume suppliers and retailers. In this respect, the Nocibé Group was fined €5.4 million by the French competition authority on March 13, 2006. Following a decision of the Court of Appeals (Cour d’appel) of Paris on January 26, 2012, the fine was reduced to €3.15 million. On June 11, 2013, the French Court of Cassation (Cour de cassation) overruled the decision of the Court of Appeals and referred the case back to that court regarding the fine imposed on Nocibé France SAS and upheld this decision concerning all other parties involved in this matter. The Court of Appeals upheld the €3.15 million fine in a decision dated April 10, 2014. On May 9, 2014, Nocibé lodged an appeal against this decision before the Court of Cassation, although the €3.15 million fine has already been paid, but on June 9, 2015, the Court of Cassation rejected Nocibé’s appeal and upheld the €3.15 million fine. Furthermore, a claim was brought on July 13, 2012 before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de commerce) of Paris by a competitor against Nocibé France and Nocibé France Distribution, in relation to alleged acts of unfair competition (parasitisme) committed by the Nocibé Group in commercializing since April 2012 products similar to those commercialized by the claimant since 2007. Damages claimed amount to €770,000. On December 20, 2013, the Commercial Court (Tribunal de commerce) of Paris dismissed the competitor’s claim and fined it for abusive proceedings. The competitor appealed the decision in February 2014 and the appeal proceedings are pending. We have reserved an amount of €700,000 in respect of this dispute. Also, on December 11, 2014, a claim was brought before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de commerce) of Lille, France, by Passion Beauté, France (an association of independent perfumeries and beauty institutes) in relation to alleged acts of wrongful termination of the sourcing agreement entered into on July 18, 2012, among Passion Beauté, Douglas-Passion Beauté Achats S.A.S., Parfumerie DOUGLAS France S.A. and Douglas Expansion SA (see also ----- “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Selected Factors Affecting _Results of Operations and Financial Position—Acquisitions and Joint Ventures”.

Passion Beauté alleged that the termination was wrongful because the sourcing joint venture was allegedly intended to be operational for a long-term period and claimed damages in the amount of €9.0 million for lost benefits of the joint venture as well as further damages of €920,500 in relation to the alleged noncompliance of DOUGLAS France S.A. and Douglas Expansion S.A. with an exclusive sourcing obligation contained in the joint sourcing agreement. As of March 31, 2015, an amount of €1.5 million has been reserved for this dispute. Sarl Maryline Beauté (Corsica franchisee) filed a complaint before the Conseil d’Etat seeking the annulment of the clearance decision of the French competition authority. The case is still pending with the Conseil d’Etat and we await a response by the court. The final outcome of the proceedings initiated by Sarl Maryline Beauté before the Conseil d’Etat is not predictable at this stage, even if it is reasonably optimistic to expect that the Conseil d’Etat would not annul the clearance decision approving the acquisition of Nocibé by Advent International Douglas. Following the taking private of our Group in the financial year 2012/2013, several Austrian landlords claimed an increase of the rent to an adequate market level pursuant to Section 12a para. 3 Austrian Act on Tenancy Law (Mietrechtsgesetz) based on the indirect change of control in Douglas Austria. Douglas Austria objected to all of the requested rent increases and has paid the increased rent amounts on a conditional basis. Out-of-court settlements were reached with two landlords and in five other cases, court proceedings have been initiated to determine an adequate market level of the rent as of the time of the change of control. All these court proceedings are pending, four of them in the Court of First Instance. The dispute with one landlord in Vienna is pending before the Austrian Supreme Court. We have, based on an opinion from an Austrian European law expert, argued that the right of the lessor under the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law to increase the rent based on a change of control occurring at the level of a holding company in another European Union country violates the freedom of establishment (Niederlassungsfreiheit) and the freedom of movement of capital (Kapitalverkehrsfreiheit) under the European Union Treaty and requested that the case be presented to the European Court of Justice. On February 24, 2015, the Austrian Supreme Court held in one of the proceedings in Austria that the right of the lessor under the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law to increase the rent based on a change of control occurring at the level of a holding company in another European Union country does not violate European law and therefore decided not to present the case to the European Court of Justice. Therefore, the court decisions in Austria now will be made solely on the basis of the wording of Section 12a of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law. Therefore, the outcome in all proceedings will be to a high degree dependent upon the determination of the adequate market level of the rent for the stores concerned which will in turn largely depend on an expert opinion commissioned by the competent courts. One additional landlord has only recently claimed an adjustment of the rent, arguing that the notification of the change of control made by Douglas Austria in 2013 was not in compliance with the requirements of the Austrian Act on Tenancy Law. Douglas Austria has rejected such increase on the basis that the notification was duly made and that the landlord’s right for rent increase is forfeited. An amount of €945,000 for a potential retroactive rent increase (as from January 1, 2013) has been reserved as of March 31, 2015. We are involved in various other proceedings many of which are rent-related. For example, a dispute about the amount of rent owed in connection with premises leased by us from the claimant and subleased by us to a third party, has been pending before the Regional Court of Essen since July 2014, with a claimed amount of approximately €650,000. The parties are in dispute about calculation of the rent increase, whereas the claimant argues that the rent adjustment is subject to the consumer price index only. In contrast, we argue that the rent adjustment is subject to the consumer price index and that, in addition, a limitation of the rent adjustment applies. With decision dated January 28, 2015, the Regional Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. On March 20, 2015, we appealed to the Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) Hamm.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Our regulatory environment is characterized by numerous national, supranational and international laws and regulations. These include, in particular, requirements with respect to product liability and consumer protection. EU regulations (EU_Verordnungen) apply directly in all member states of the European Union (the “EU Member States”). As a result, our business is subject to these rules in all EU Member States. In contrast, EU directives (EU-Richtlinien), while binding EU Member States as to the result to be achieved, need to be implemented into national law. Hence, regarding those standards contained in EU directives that are applicable to our business, national implementing rules can differ slightly from one EU Member State to another. To the extent governed by EU regulations or national laws that are based on EU directives, the regulatory environment in most other EU Member States and the member states of the EEA is similar to the regulatory framework in Germany. The regulatory requirements applicable to our business activities are subject to change, as they are continuously adapted at the national, European and international level. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil liability, administrative orders, fines, or even criminal sanctions. The following provides a brief overview of selected regulations that are applicable to our business operations. _Foreign Trade and Customs Law_ We source most of our products from Europe, but some of our suppliers are located in Asia. Within the European internal market the principle of free movement of goods applies. With respect to import and export of goods from countries that are not members of the EU, we must comply with national and European foreign trade and customs regulations. At EU level our relevant regulatory framework is laid down in Council’s Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of October 12, 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (“CCC”). The CCC will be replaced by the Union Customs Code (“UCC”) which was adopted on October 9, 2013 as Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. This regulation entered into force on October 30, 2013 but the substantive provisions of the UCC will apply only as of May 1, 2016, once the UCC-related Commission acts (i.e. delegated and implementing acts) are adopted and in force. Until May 1, 2016, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2913/92 of October 12, 1992 and its implementing legislation Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 2454/93 remains in effect. The modernized customs code (Regulation (EC) No. 450/2008) was repealed pursuant to Art. 286(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013. The UCC shall, among other, simplify customs rules and procedures and facilitate more efficient customs transactions in line with modern-day needs, completing the shift by customs authorities to a paperless and fully electronic environment. Whereas imports and exports within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) are in principle not liable to customs duty, the movement of goods beyond the frontiers of the EEA is subject to customs control between the customs union of the EU and EEA member states which are not EU Member States. The customs control charges, among other things, statutory import duties. Customs offices may from time to time initiate customs inspections to assess whether customs regulations have been infringed. _Consumer Protection Law_ We must further comply with various consumer protection regulations with respect to the marketing and sale of products to customers, including our online selling activities. ----- Throughout the EU, consumer protection is extensively regulated in particular on the basis of the following EU directives: - the Council Directive 93/13/EEC of April 5, 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts; - the Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 25, 1999 on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees; - the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal market (Directive on electronic commerce); - the Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 12, 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications); - the Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 11, 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive), which prohibits, among others, certain particularly aggressive or misleading commercial practices or advertising; and - the Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2011 on consumer rights (the “Directive on Consumer Rights”) which replaced the Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts with effect as of June 13, 2014. The aforementioned EU directives on consumer protection and the national laws which implement or complement these directives (such as, in Germany, the Act on the Implementation of the EU Consumer Rights Directive and on the Amendment of the Law on Housing (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Verbraucherrechterichtlinie und zur _Änderung des Gesetzes zur Regelung der Wohnungsvermittlung), which entered into force on June 13, 2014, and the_ French consumer code (code de la consommation) in France), impose extensive duties and responsibilities retailers such as Douglas, including the following: With respect to our online activities, online purchases constitute “distance contracts” that are subject to specific consumer protection. Pursuant to the Directive on Consumer Rights, effective as from June 13, 2014, consumers have the statutory right (EU-wide) to withdraw from a distance contract within 14 days after receipt of goods (or within a period of twelve months and 14 days after receipt of goods if the consumer has not been properly informed about its statutory right of withdrawal). Withdrawal must be exercised by distinct declaration towards the seller (e.g., in writing, per e-mail or phone). The return of the goods without further comment does not constitute a valid declaration of withdrawal any longer. If the statutory right of withdrawal is exercised, within 14 days, the customer must return the goods and the seller must reimburse the purchase price including shipping costs (if any) except that the seller must not reimburse the supplementary costs, if the consumer has expressly opted for a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the seller (e.g., express delivery). The customer, on the other hand, has to bear such supplementary costs for the return of goods unless the seller has failed to inform the customer accordingly or the seller has expressly agreed to assume these costs. The customer also has to compensate the seller for any loss in value of the returned goods, if such loss is due to the customer handling the goods in a way that was not required to examine the condition, features and functionalities of the goods and the seller has informed the customer about its statutory right of withdrawal. In addition, online retailers must comply with extensive and formalized information requirements. They have to provide their (potential) customers with detailed and accurate information, inter alia, on the offered goods, on the way a binding contract can be concluded, on price and payment details, on their return policy, on the statutory right to withdraw from a contract (irrespective of any more beneficial return policy that may be afforded by the online retailers, on their general terms of sale and on statutory warranties). EU directives and national laws set out detailed criteria on when, where and by which means this information has to be provided. Online retailers have to implement these requirements in the design and structure of their online shops, mobile-commerce platforms and apps, in their ordering and payment processes and in their delivery systems. Due to changes in legislation, online retailers have to adapt their shop design on an ongoing basis. For example, as a result of the Directive on Consumer Rights, online retailers were obliged to implement a “button solution” pursuant to which a binding purchase can only be completed by clicking on a button that is explicitly labeled “buy now” (or similar) and which can be found in the immediate proximity of a ----- summary of certain key information relating to the purchase, Art. 8(2) of the Directive on Consumer Rights. Failure to comply with these information requirements may give rise to civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief) or fines and may in some cases result in an extension of warranty periods or even in the invalidity of the affected customer contracts. Advertising, including promotional games, newsletters and personalized product recommendations, is heavily regulated, in particular if distributed through e-mail. An advertisement must not be misleading, constitute an unreasonable nuisance or make use of harassment, coercion or undue influence. These criteria leave wide room for interpretation and the assessment of courts and other competent bodies is often hard to foresee. _Data Protection Law_ As retailers generally process customer data for marketing purposes, compliance with data protection laws must be ensured. The collection, processing and use of personal data is extensively regulated by both European and national legislation. At EU level, data privacy law is primarily governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the “Data Protection Directive”) and—specifically with respect to electronic communication—by Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 12, 2002, concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (the “Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications”). In Germany, general data privacy law is governed in particular by the German Federal Data Protection Act (the “Data Protection Act”) (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz). In addition, various sector specific statutes set forth specific data privacy rules which apply to certain industries or businesses and prevail over the general rules of the Data Protection Act. Moreover, e-commerce providers have to comply with the specific requirements provided in the German Telemedia Act (the “Telemedia Act”) (Telemediengesetz) which take into consideration the peculiarities of online communication and may deviate from the general rules of the Data Protection Act. For example, the Telemedia Act on the one hand provides for additional information obligations which go beyond the general requirements of the Data Protection Act. However, on the other hand, the Telemedia Act allows for electronic declarations of consent while the Data Protection Act, in principle, requires the written form. Compared to other European jurisdictions, the German data privacy law is known to be rather strict. For example, the Data Protection Act provides for a detailed regulatory system regarding contracts relating to commissioned data processing (Auftragsdatenverarbeitung) which has to be implemented in particular in the context of IT outsourcings. In France, we are subject to the French law dated January 6, 1978, for the collection of personal data of our customers. The European legislator is currently considering a proposed new regulation on data privacy (the “General Data Protection Regulation”) which would introduce substantial changes to the EU data protection regime, involving replacement of the current national data protection laws by a directly applicable EU regulation. Furthermore, the current draft includes the increase of the maximum level of fines for compliance failures to up to €100 million or 5% of the global turnover on a group basis (whichever is greater). As a result, the General Data Protection Regulation would, if implemented in its current form, impose a substantially increased risk of fines for non-compliance on all data processing entities. Also, the current draft provides for additional information requirements in the data privacy notice of a website, including a controversially debated two-step icon solution pursuant to which the operator of a website has to post certain pop-up icons which correspond to the categories of data processing applied on the website. The proposed EU regulation continues to progress through the legislative process and it is not currently possible to foresee its final content and wording and thus to assess its full potential impact. In February 2015, the German government adopted a draft law aiming at improving the enforcement under civil law of the data protection regulations related to consumer protection. The core aspects of the draft law include new possibilities for consumer associations to issue warnings and commence actions to enforce data protection law in the interest of consumer protection. The consumer associations are considered to be an appropriate instrument to support the efforts of the data protections agencies. Consumer interests may be affected, in particular, where personal data are collected, processed and used for purposes of advertising and data trading or to create personality and usage profiles. In general, data privacy laws regulate when and how personal data may be collected, for which purposes they may be processed and/or used, for how long they may be stored and to whom and how they may be transferred. The transfer of personal data to entities outside the EEA is subject to specific requirements. Furthermore, data privacy laws require organizational measures such as the appointment of a data protection officer (Datenschutzbeauftragter), set forth the rights of data subjects (i.e., the persons to whom the personal data relates) (e.g., information rights) and determine the sanctions for infringements. Apart from that, the data privacy law requires the implementation of appropriate technical and organization measures (technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen) to ensure the data security in general. ----- _Regulations on Shop Closing Time_ Most European countries have regulations on shop closing times, which particularly apply to shop closing times on weekends and holidays. Regulations on shop closing times during night hours on working days were suspended by several European countries as respective regulations were not required anymore after the implementation of Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organization of working time. In Germany, closing times are regulated by the federal states (Ladenschlussrecht). In Germany, there are strict regulations on shop closing times on weekends and holidays, with only occasional exceptions with respect to opening hours on certain Sundays. The city retail businesses occasionally make use of regularly prolonged shopping hours. In France, the legal working times as well as the obligation to rest on Sunday (which is subject to some exceptions) are mainly regulated by the French labor code (code _du travail). Regulation on the Selective Channel_ The selective distribution channel, as implemented by the suppliers of our Group, is subject to European and German competition law. In this respect, the following principles apply: Art. 101 (1) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) and Section 1 of the German Act against Restraints of Competitions (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen—“GWB”) prohibit agreements which have an anticompetitive object or restrictive effects on competition, unless such agreements fall under so-called block exemptions or individual exemptions pursuant to Art. 101 (3) TFEU and Section 2 GWB. Contractual clauses violating European or German competition law are void which may also affect the remainder of the respective agreements. Furthermore, in such case the competent cartel authorities may initiate proceedings against the contractual parties. According to the relevant case law, Art. 101 (1) TFEU and Section 1 GWB do not apply if selective distribution channel are based on purely qualitative criteria, provided that: (i) the nature of the product needs to justify a selective distribution channel in order to ensure the quality of service around the respective product and its appropriate use; (ii) the authorization of distributors is only based on objective and non-discriminatory quality criteria which are applied consistently and (iii) such criteria do not exceed what is necessary to ensure the quality of service around the respective product and its appropriate use. Irrespective of whether these criteria are met, in particular if additional quantitative criteria are included in the selective distribution channel, the relevant agreements may nonetheless benefit from an exemption under EU Regulation No. 330/2010 (Vertical Block Exemption Regulation). Such exemption requires that the market share of both the supplier and the authorized distributor does not exceed 30% and respective agreements do not contain so-called “hard core” restrictions of competition. In the context of selective distribution channel, resale price maintenance, restrictions of active or passive sales to end consumers and restrictions of cross-supplies between authorized distributors constitute such “hard core” restrictions. The above principles also apply to online selective distribution with a per se prohibition of online sales or criteria for online sales which are not overall equivalent to the criteria imposed for the sales from stationary shops, and are not necessary to assure a certain quality of distribution. Such clauses may constitute hard-core restrictions and will also very often not qualify for an exemption under Art. 101 (3) TFEU. Furthermore, there are ongoing discussions, involving cartel authorities, whether a prohibition of sales on open online platforms (such as eBay) is in line with competition law or whether such a prohibition may raise anticompetitive concerns. EU Regulation No. 330/2010 is scheduled to expire in May 2022. With regard to this regulation, but also generally, it cannot be excluded that following changes in the applicable statutes, regulations, or developments of the case law or decision-making practice of the relevant competition authorities, other channels of sale may begin selling products (or increasingly sell products) that currently generate the majority of our sales and this may lead to a significant increase in competition (see also “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We may be adversely affected by _changes antitrust and competition laws and regulations, in particular with respect to selective distribution contracts.”). Cosmetics Regulation_ On November 30, 2009, EU Regulation 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the “Cosmetic Products Regulation”) was adopted, which replaced the older Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC of July 27, 1976. Most of the provisions of the Cosmetic Products Regulation became applicable as from July 11, 2013. The Cosmetic Products Regulation is the main regulatory framework for finished cosmetic products as defined therein when placed on the EU market. In addition to the Cosmetic Products Regulation, other EU and/or national legislation may ----- apply for certain aspects of the regulation of cosmetic products. The Cosmetic Products Regulation provides an internationally recognized regime, which reinforces the safety of cosmetic products taking into consideration the latest technological developments, including the possible use of nanomaterial. The main purpose of the Cosmetic Products Regulation is to ensure that only safe cosmetic products are placed on the EU market. This requires in particular that cosmetic products are manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice. Further, the Cosmetic Products Regulation prohibits or restricts the use of a wide range of substances in cosmetic products. With respect to the use of colorants, preservatives and UV-filters, including those that are nanomaterials, these can only be used if explicitly allowed by the Cosmetic Products Regulation. Products containing other nanomaterials not otherwise restricted by the Cosmetic Products Regulation may be the object of a full safety assessment at EU level, if the EU Commission has concerns. Nanomaterials must be labeled in the list of ingredients with the word “nano” in brackets following the name of the substance. Furthermore, only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the EU as “responsible person” can be placed on the market. As a general rule, the responsible person must be established within the EU and is either the manufacturer or importer or a person or entity designated by those. The Cosmetic Products Regulation includes rules to allow for the precise identification of who the responsible person is with regard to a certain product, and clearly outlines the obligations of such responsible person. Responsible persons have, inter alia, an obligation to notify serious undesirable effects to competent national authorities. Further, responsible persons must ensure that a cosmetic product has undergone a safety assessment and that a product safety report has been set up for the product before it is placed on the market. The Cosmetic Products Regulation also imposes documentation obligations on the responsible person. As for our private label products, certain subsidiaries of our Group act as responsible person for purposes of the Cosmetic Products Regulation. The Cosmetic Products Regulation does not only impose obligations on the responsible person, but also on distributors of cosmetic products. Further, the Cosmetic Products Regulation introduces a centralized notification process for all cosmetic products placed on the EU market, so that manufacturers will need to notify their products only once. The Cosmetic Products Regulation also includes rules banning animal testing and comprehensive labeling requirements. In Germany, violations of the Cosmetic Products Regulation may be sanctioned under the Regulation on Cosmetic Products (Verordnung über _kosmetische Mittel (Kosmetik-Verordnung)) of July 16, 2014, with a fine and in severe cases with a criminal sanction._ We review our private label products, which are manufactured by third-party suppliers and which we then sell under our own brands, for compliance with the applicable regulations of the Cosmetic Products Regulation. For further information on the risks associated with our private label products, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Market _Environment and_ _Business—We are subject to risks in connection with the quality and timely delivery of our private label products and our relationship with the manufacturers of such products.”. Regulations Regarding Product Safety and Product Liability_ Producers and distributors who place products on the market in the European Union must ensure that the products are safe. Among other regulations, Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 3, 2001, as last amended by EC Regulation 596/2009 of June 18, 2009, on general product safety (the “EU Directive on Product Safety”), according to which manufacturers must put on the market products that comply with the general safety requirement, applies (as implemented in the individual EU countries). In addition, producers must provide consumers with the necessary information so that consumers are able to assess a product’s inherent threat, particularly when this is not directly obvious. Furthermore, producers must adopt the necessary measures to avoid such threats, for example, by withdrawing unsafe products from the market, informing customers and recalling products that have already been supplied to customers. In this context, it is relevant to note that under the EU Directive on Product Safety—as well as pursuant to most other European and/or national legislation on product safety—any entity presenting itself as the manufacturer by affixing its name, trademark or other distinctive mark to a product qualifies as producer and must comply with the above mentioned obligations. As we sell products manufactured by third parties under our own brands, we qualify as a producer. Pursuant to the EU Directive on Product Safety, distributors must help to ensure that the products they supply comply with the general safety requirements, monitor the safety of products on the market and provide the necessary documents ensuring that the products can be traced. If the producers or the distributors discover that a product is dangerous, they must notify the competent authorities and, if necessary, co-operate with them. In Germany, the EU Directive on Product Safety has been implemented by the Act on Product Safety (Gesetz _über die Bereitstellung von Produkten auf dem Markt (Produktsicherheitsgesetz)) of November 8, 2011. Further detailed_ regulations are set forth in various governmental regulations (Rechtsverordnungen) on the safety of specific products/product groups. A violation of the requirements of European and/or national law may be sanctioned with a fine and in severe cases with a criminal sanction. In addition, the market surveillance authorities may issue orders, relating ----- for instance to the testing of a product, sales bans or recalls. Moreover, the German Act on Food, Feed and Consumer Products (Lebensmittel-, Bedarfsgegenstände- und Futtermittelgesetzbuch) as well as the Regulation on Consumer Products (Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung) apply to beauty and cosmetics products, as well as several other products offered by us (such as accessories and home products). The aforementioned act and regulation are primarily aimed at protecting the health of consumers that come into contact with certain products and grant extensive powers to the competent authorities in order to supervise the compliance of manufacturers and distributors of products with their legal duties. In this context, the competent authorities can in particular order sales bans and recalls or inform the public in case a product puts at risk human health. A violation of the requirements of the German Act on Food, Feed and Consumer Products may be sanctioned with a fine and in severe cases with a criminal sanction. In addition, because we sell our private label products (manufactured by third parties) under our own brands and import certain products from outside the EU, we qualify as producer of certain cosmetic and other products and are thus subject to applicable legislation on product liability. For example, all Member States of the European Union were required to implement EU Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985, as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC of May 10, 1999, on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (“Product Liability Directive”), which applies to all movables marketed in the European Economic area (with very few exceptions). The Product Liability Directive establishes the principle of strict liability, i.e., liability without fault of the producer, in cases of damage caused by a defective product. It covers death, personal injuries and damages of at least €500 to an item of property caused by defective products intended for private use or consumption. The Product Liability Directive does not stipulate any financial ceiling on the producer’s liability, but allows the Member States to limit a producer’s liability for damage from a death or personal injury and caused by identical items with the same defect to an amount of at least €70.0 million. For example, in Germany, the Product Liability Act stipulates a limit of €85.0 million. In addition, the Product Liability Directive does not prevent the legal systems of the Member States from granting additional or more extensive rights to injured parties based on grounds of contractual liability or on grounds of non-contractual liability. Environmental laws may be applicable for the disposal of cosmetics and may contain provisions regulating the special treatment of cosmetic disposal. The same applies to the packaging of cosmetic and other products. For instance, the EU Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 20, 1994, amended by Directive 2013/2/EU of February 7, 2013, on packaging and packaging waste (as implemented in the individual EU countries) must be complied with. _French Law on the Modernization of the Economy_ In France, we must comply with Article L. 441-6 of the French Commercial code (code de commerce), as amended by the Law on the modernization of the economy No. 2008-776 of August 4, 2008 (“LME”). This provision, as amended, contains two rules applying to payment terms. According to the first rule, if the parties do not agree on specific payment terms (e.g., through a specific provision included in the seller’s general sales terms or the purchaser’s general purchasing terms), this term is automatically 30 days after the receipt of the goods or of the provision of the services. According to the second rule, the parties may not agree on payment terms exceeding 45 days from the end of the month (i.e., 45 days starting from the end of the month during which the invoice is issued or alternatively the end of the month during which a delay of 45 days from the date of issuance of the invoice expires) or 60 calendar days from the issuance of the invoice. _CICE_ In December 2012, the CICE (Crédit d’impôt compétitivité et emploi) was adopted as part of an overall French government policy to improve the competitive position of companies in France. Pursuant to the CICE, French companies will receive a tax credit of 4% of the gross salaries paid to certain employees for 2013 and 6% of the gross salaries of certain employees in 2014 and subsequent years. The amount of the CICE is calculated on the basis of gross salaries paid in the course of the calendar year, whose wages are below 2.5 times the French statutory minimum wage. Pursuant to the terms of the CICE scheme, an employee’s gross salary is calculated on the basis of such employee’s normal working hours plus such employee’s overtime hours (but without taking into account the overtime rate payable in respect of such overtime). The amounts paid under profit sharing agreements are also not included in the employee’s gross salary for the purpose of computing the CICE. We expect the CICE to have a positive impact on our French operations and on our EBITDA. ----- Pursuant to the French Third Amended Finance Law for 2012 (3ème loi de finances rectificative pour 2012) No. 2012-1510 dated December 29, 2012, adopting the CICE, an ad hoc committee comprising government and trade union representatives will be established to supervise the implementation of the CICE. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In addition, 12.73% of the total Douglas Holding AG shares were acquired by Beauty Holding One GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), from Lobelia Beteiligungs GmbH, Grünwald, Germany, and, on December 14, 2012, transferred by Beauty Holding One GmbH to Beauty Holding Two GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, (a wholly owned subsidiary of Beauty Holding One GmbH; at that time: Beauty Holding Two AG), and on January 9, 2013, by Beauty Holding Two GmbH to Beauty Holding Three AG (a wholly owned subsidiary of Beauty Holding Two GmbH) in each case by way of contribution into the capital reserves. Together with further smaller acquisitions of Douglas Holding AG shares, Beauty Holding Three AG held a total of 96.17% in Douglas Holding AG after the settlement of the public takeover offer. Subsequently, effective as of February 20, 2013, Beauty Holding Three AG as the transferring entity was merged upstream into Beauty Holding Two GmbH (at that time: Beauty Holding Two AG) as the absorbing entity, which was then transformed into a German limited liability company resulting, in principle, in the holding structure as of the date of this offering memorandum. Furthermore, 0.63% were later acquired during the further acceptance period pursuant to section 39c of the German Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz). On May 28, 2013, the shareholders’ meeting of Douglas Holding AG resolved with the votes of the shares held by Beauty Holding Two GmbH to squeeze-out the minority shareholders pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) against payment of a cash compensation. The squeeze-out resolution was registered with the commercial register of Douglas Holding AG on July 25, 2013. On that date, approximately 3.21% of the total Douglas Holding AG shares were held by minority shareholders, which then were booked into the deposit account of Beauty Holding Two GmbH against payment of the squeeze-out compensation. Following the effectiveness of the squeeze-out, the stock exchanges on which the Douglas Holding AG shares were listed revoked the admission of the Douglas Holding AG shares to the regulated market. In the context of the squeeze-out, Beauty Holding Two GmbH is involved in a legal dispute regarding the appraisal of the cash compensation for the minority shareholders before the Regional Court (Landgericht) in Dortmund.

On the same date, AI Perfume France SAS and the sellers under the Nocibé SPA (the “Nocibé Sellers”) entered into a supplemental agreement under which the Nocibé Sellers undertook to indemnify AI Perfume France SAS up to an amount of €9.0 million if one or more of the following tax risks occurs: (i) a tax reassessment in respect of the tax deductibility of certain convertible bonds issued by Groupe Nocibé SAS materializes within three years following completion of the Nocibé Acquisition, (ii) an enforceable judgment is issued in a pending litigation with the French tax administration with respect to the deductibility of fees and commissions paid by Groupe Nocibé France SAS to certain advisors in 2006, (iii) a tax reassessment with respect to the partial contribution of assets by Nocibé France SAS to Nocibé France Distribution SAS in 2010 materializes within the time period until February 15, 2017 and (iv) a tax reassessment with respect to the debt-to-equity-ratio of Groupe Nocibé France SAS for the financial year 2011 materializes within three years following completion of the Nocibé Acquisition. In addition to the tax indemnities provided for in the supplemental agreement, the Nocibé Sellers gave certain limited representations and warranties, but no far reaching business representations and warranties (i.e., except for a representation and warranty relating to the conduct of business between January 1, 2013 and February 14, 2014). The liability of the Nocibé Sellers under these representations and warranties will expire on June 24, 2015 and, for any other claims under the Nocibé SPA (other than certain tax indemnities under the supplemental agreement), on December 24, 2015. The aggregate indemnification obligations of the Nocibé Sellers relating to the representations and warranties ----- made under the Nocibé SPA are capped at the amount of the purchase price and the indemnification obligation of each Nocibé Seller under the Nocibé SPA (including the tax indemnities) is capped at such Nocibé Seller’s share in the purchase price. The Nocibé Acquisition was completed on June 24, 2014 (with effect for accounting purposes as of July 1, 2014) and an agreed final purchase price was paid by AI Perfume France SAS. No purchase price adjustments are pending under the Nocibé SPA. An amount of €9,000,000 was put on an escrow account on June 24, 2014 to secure claims against the Nocibé Sellers under the aforementioned tax indemnities. In order to obtain merger control clearance for the Nocibé Acquisition, Douglas proposed certain antitrust remedies to the French competition authority and obtained clearance on June 4, 2014. These remedies consist in divesting a total of 38 stores (either owned stores or franchised stores) located in 32 local areas where the combined presence of Douglas and Nocibé was regarded by the French competition authority as problematic from a competition standpoint. On December 17, 2014, it was agreed that 13 owned stores among the stores concerned by the requirements would be sold to Parfumerie Athénais Espace Beauté SAS. Such sale was completed on February 18, 2015.

While we did not verify or modify any of the market data or other data provided by OC&C, we have delivered, upon OC&C’s request, certain factual information to OC&C and have discussed the underlying assumptions with OC&C. We compiled our estimates for the market and competitive data in part on the basis of available historical data and in part on the basis of assumptions and methodologies which we believe to be reasonable, as well as various sources we believe to be reliable. Because publicly available information on the selective beauty markets in the different countries is only available to a very limited extent, the data included in the OC&C Report and shown in this offering memorandum is based on a modeling methodology described in greater detail under “—The European Selective Beauty Market—Definition of the European Selective Beauty Market; Key Characteristics” below. In addition, OC&C made assessments regarding the selective beauty sales of competitors using different approaches and methodologies, especially where published results for the different competitors (e.g., with respect to the respective sales of selective beauty products) were not available; in certain cases, sales for our Group and for competitors were considered for different periods, thus limiting comparability. Therefore, the following data, especially on market sizes, past and projected growth rates and competitive position should be viewed with caution and in light of such limitations, and may differ from market and competitive data contained in other analyses or calculations of selective sales of competitors. Additional factors, which should be considered in assessing the market and competitive data, including the projected growth rates, are described elsewhere in this offering memorandum, in particular those set out in the section entitled “Risk Factors”.

On or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Senior Unsecured Creditors in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities in accordance with the Senior Unsecured Notes Finance Documents and in respect of the Senior Unsecured Loan Liabilities in accordance with the Senior Unsecured Loan Finance Documents. _Payment Blockage Provisions_ Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of the Senior Agent and (to the extent otherwise prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” below, the Debtors shall not make (and the Parent shall procure that no member of the Parent Group shall), and no finance party under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents (the “Senior Unsecured Finance Parties”) may receive from a Debtor or any member of the Parent Group, any Permitted Senior Unsecured Payment (other than Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts and any Senior Unsecured Agent Liabilities) if: - a Senior Secured Payment Default, as defined in the section under the caption “Permitted Senior Unsecured Payments” above, is continuing; or - an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) (other than a Senior Secured Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which the Senior Agent(s) or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as the case may be) delivers a payment stop notice specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Secured Event of Default to the Parent, the Company, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Representative until the earliest of: - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice; - in relation to payments of Senior Unsecured Liabilities, if a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires; - the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default has been remedied or waived in accordance with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or the Senior Secured Finance Documents (as applicable); - the date on which the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as applicable) delivers a notice to the Parent, the Company, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) cancelling the Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice; - the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and - the date on which the Security Agent or the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) takes Enforcement Action (as defined below) permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor. Unless the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) waives this requirement (i) no new Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice and (ii) no Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that the Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as applicable) received notice of that Senior Secured Event of Default. ----- The Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) may only serve one Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agent(s) or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) to issue a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Agent or Senior Secured Notes Trustee in respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agent(s) or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) at the time at which an earlier Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice was issued. Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice with respect to the relevant Event of Default on behalf of the Senior Unsecured Creditors (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”). Notwithstanding anything else in the Intercreditor Agreement, no Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice will prevent the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer or Senior Unsecured Borrower from making a payment from its own assets if that payment is of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Unsecured Notes or the Senior Unsecured Borrower’s obligations under the Senior Unsecured Loan Finance Documents and such payment is not financed by a payment to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer or the Senior Unsecured Borrower from a member of the Group that was prohibited by the Senior Secured Facility Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement at the time such payment was made. _Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_ No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Unsecured Finance Document by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to the Senior Unsecured Creditors and the Senior Unsecured _Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions._ The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice. _Cure of Payment Stop_ If: (i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default, that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and (ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Unsecured Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents and which would have been Permitted Senior Unsecured Payments but for that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default, then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Unsecured Creditors. _Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_ Subject to the following paragraph, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Unsecured Creditors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents (other than the Intercreditor Agreement or any security document) in accordance with their terms at any time. Prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Finance Parties may not, without the consent of the Majority Senior Lenders (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) and (to the extent otherwise prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s), amend or waive the terms of the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents if the amendment or waiver would result in the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents being inconsistent with any requirements thereof set out in any Senior Secured Finance Document. ----- _Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Enforcement_ Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group: (i) no Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any transaction security (and such term does not include the Senior Unsecured Only Security); and (ii) no Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Unsecured Guarantees, except as permitted under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement” below. “Enforcement Action” is defined as: - in relation to any liabilities: - the acceleration of any liabilities or the making of any declaration that any liabilities are prematurely due and payable (other than as a result of it becoming unlawful for a Senior Lender, a Senior Secured Noteholder, a Senior Unsecured Lender or a Senior Unsecured Noteholder to perform its obligations under, or of any voluntary or mandatory prepayment arising under, the debt documents); - the making of any declaration that any liabilities are payable on demand; - the making of a demand in relation to a liability that is payable on demand; - the making of any demand against any member of the Parent Group in relation to any guarantee liabilities of that member of the Parent Group; - the exercise of any right to require any member of the Parent Group to acquire any liability (including exercising any put or call option against any member of the Parent Group for the redemption or purchase of any liability but excluding any such right which arises as a result of the permitted debt purchase transactions provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or any similar provisions in the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents or the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents and excluding any mandatory offer arising as a result of a change of control, asset sale or escrow special mandatory redemption (howsoever described) as set out in the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents or the Senior Unsecured Notes Finance Documents);

and - the suing for, commencing or joining of any legal or arbitration proceedings against any member of the Parent Group to recover any liabilities; - the premature termination or close-out of any hedging transaction under any Hedging Agreement, save to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement;

or - the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, administrator, judicial manager or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration, judicial management or reorganization of any member of the Parent Group which owes any liabilities to a creditor under the debt documents, or has given any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such liabilities, or any of such member of the Parent Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such member of the Parent Group, or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction, except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action: - the taking of any action falling within bullet point above beginning ‘the suing for’ or the bullet point immediately above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary) to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the registration of such claims before any court or governmental authority and the bringing, supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent any loss of the right to bring, support or join proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; - an Ancillary Lender, Hedge Counterparty, an Issuing Bank or Senior Unsecured Representative(s) bringing legal proceedings against any person solely for the purpose of (A) obtaining injunctive relief (or any analogous remedy outside England and Wales) to restrain any actual or putative breach of any debt document to which it is party, (B) obtaining specific performance (other than specific performance of an obligation to make a payment) with no claim for damages, and (C) requesting judicial interpretation of any provision of any debt document to which it is party with no claim for damages; or - bringing legal proceedings against any person in connection with any securities violation, securities or listing relations or common law fraud or to restrain any actual or putative breach of the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or the Senior Secured Finance Documents or for specific performance with no claims for damages. _Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement_ The restrictions set out under the caption “—Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Enforcement” above will not apply in respect of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities or the transaction security documents (if any) which secure the Senior Unsecured Liabilities as permitted by paragraph (iii) set out under the caption “—Restriction on Payment and _Dealings” above, if:_ (i) a default under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents (the “Relevant Senior Unsecured Default”) is continuing; (ii) the Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default from the Senior Unsecured Representative(s); (iii) a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and (iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period. ----- Promptly upon becoming aware of a default under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents (a “Senior Unsecured Default”), the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) may by notice (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) of the existence of such Senior Unsecured Default. _Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_ In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Unsecured Representative(s) serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) in respect of such Relevant Senior Unsecured Default and ending on the earliest to occur of: (i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Period”); (ii) the date the Senior Secured Creditors take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor, provided, however, that: (A) if a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Unsecured Finance Parties may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Debtor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Creditors against such Debtor and not against any other member of the Parent Group; and (B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it; (iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in relation to a particular Debtor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

If the Senior Unsecured Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the enforcement of the security (other than the Senior Unsecured Only Security) in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such Enforcement Action must require the realisation of the relevant security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Distressed Disposals”. _Option to Purchase Senior Secured Liabilities and transfer of Hedging Liabilities: Senior Unsecured Creditors_ Upon acceleration under the Senior Finance Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents or the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or enforcement of the transaction security, Senior Unsecured Creditors (or those that wish to make the relevant purchase) may by not less than 10 business days’ notice elect to purchase the outstanding Senior Lender Liabilities and outstanding Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses and provide cash cover in respect of any ----- letters of credit that are outstanding. The relevant Senior Unsecured Creditors must also elect for the Hedge Counterparties to transfer their Hedging Liabilities to them at the same time in exchange for the amount that would have been payable under the relevant Hedging Agreements had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

During the 40-day distribution compliance period (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to _Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._ Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a BookEntry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Senior Secured Notes: (1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Senior Secured Notes; (2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed in part; (3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date with respect to such Senior Secured Notes; or (4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee) who will send such notice to each Holder of any Senior Secured Notes: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased (including that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent or such tender agent, as applicable, receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile or electronic transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Senior Secured Notes purchased); and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. ----- On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the ----- Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the _funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving_ credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On the 361st day after an Asset Disposition (or the 541st day if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been entered into), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €30 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Senior Secured Notes. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will repay the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset ----- Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity, security or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, prefunding or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such security, prefunding or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual knowledge has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification, security or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may (without liability for so doing) withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. ----- The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified, prefunded or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Escrow Agreement and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the forms of Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information”. The proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together with the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes, amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the purchase price payable under the Acquisition Agreement, (ii) repay certain existing indebtedness of the Target Group (as defined below) and (iii) pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds”. Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the initial purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes into an escrow account (the “Senior Secured Notes Escrow _Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Senior Secured Notes Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the Issue_ Date among the Issuer, the Trustee and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”).

See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”. Following the Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. See “—Security”. Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by Kirk Beauty One GmbH (the “Senior Notes Issuer” or the “Parent”) and will not be guaranteed by Beauty Holding Zero GmbH (the “Target”) or any of its subsidiaries (the Target and such entities, together with their subsidiaries, the “Target Group”).

Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will not control the Target Group, and the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in this Description of the Senior Secured Notes. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date. The aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes issued in this offering will be €300.0 million. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes from time to time after this offering having identical terms and conditions as the Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”).

None of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Notes Indenture will apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries and no future Unrestricted Subsidiary will guarantee the Senior Notes. Following the Completion Date, all of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Notes. Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Notes. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders of Senior Notes to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s Indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations, if any), except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively subordinated to any obligations secured over the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and subordinated in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to the claims held by the Issuer or such Guarantor.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent; or (2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant _Taxing Jurisdiction”),_ will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Note, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Note, the Senior Notes Indenture or a Note Guarantee; (2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding is payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all ----- or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; (3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder; (4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with respect to the Senior Notes or any Note Guarantee; (5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing, or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; (7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Senior Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; (8) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or (9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate or other reasonable evidence stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Senior Notes then outstanding. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes or this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Notes; ----- (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of _Control Offer”) to the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable (with a copy to the_ Trustee) who will send such notice to each Holder of any Senior Notes: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Senior Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; ----- (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Notes repurchased (including that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent or such tender agent, as applicable, receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile or electronic transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Senior Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Senior Notes purchased); and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or portions of the Senior Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior ----- Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and would require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to offer to repurchase all of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary _to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving_ credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. On the 391st day after an Asset Disposition (or the 571st day if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been entered into), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €30 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Senior Notes.

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on _Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Notes Indenture_ except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment being made while the Covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause ----- (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.

Disbursing Agents are German resident credit institutions and financial services institutions (including in both cases German permanent establishments of foreign institutions), securities trading companies or securities trading banks. The applicable withholding tax rate is 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon and, if applicable, church tax). For individuals who are subject to church tax an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the investor will be assessed to church tax. The withholding tax regime generally also applies to any gains from the sale, transfer or redemption of Notes realized by private investors holding the Notes as private (and not as business) assets in custody with a Disbursing Agent. Subject to exceptions, the amount of capital gains on which the withholding tax charge is applied is generally levied on the difference between the proceeds received upon the disposal or redemption of the Notes and (after the deduction of actual expenses directly related thereto) the acquisition costs. If interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e. without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are also subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. If the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since their acquisition and the current Disbursing Agent has not been notified of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes in the form required by law, the tax at a rate of 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, church tax) will be imposed on an amount equal to 30% of the proceeds from the sale or redemption of the Notes. In computing any withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent generally deducts from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the private individual investor via the Disbursing Agent (e.g. losses from sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent also deducts accrued interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions the Disbursing Agent credits foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the private individual investor in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. The withholding tax is not applied if the total investment income of a private investor is not exceeding the lump sum deduction (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), provided that the private individual investor files an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent. Expenses of the ----- private individual investor actually incurred are not deductible. No withholding tax will be levied if a private individual investor has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent German tax office. German resident corporate and other German resident business investors should in essence not be subject to the withholding tax on gains from the disposal, sale or redemption of the Notes (i.e., for these investors only interest payments, but not gains from the sale or redemption of the Notes, are subject to the withholding tax regime).

For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland). On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted Council Directive 2014/48/EU (the “Amending Directive”) amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. The Amending Directive requires Member States to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017, and if they were to take effect the changes would expand the range of payments covered by the EU Savings Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. They would also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported or subject to withholding. This approach would apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union. By legislative regulations dated 26 January 2004 the German Federal Government enacted provisions implementing the information exchange on the basis of the EU Savings Directive into German law.

This is to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Directive and a new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU).

Interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, will be ordinary income from sources outside the United States. Subject to applicable limitations, a U.S. Holder may claim a deduction or a foreign tax credit only for tax withheld at the appropriate rate. If the Notes are issued at an original issue discount (“OID”), a U.S. Holder must accrue the OID into income on a constant yield to maturity basis whether or not it receives cash payments. The Notes will have been issued with OID if their stated redemption price exceeds their issue price by as much as 0.25% multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity. The OID will be the amount by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds the issue price. The issue price of the Notes is the initial offering price at which a substantial amount of the Notes are sold to the public (excluding sales to brokers or similar persons). The stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all payments due on a Note other than payments of stated interest. This disclosure assumes that the payment schedule for the Notes, without payment of the redemption premium that the Issuer must pay on a Change of Control, is more likely than not the actual payment schedule for the Notes and therefore such premium is not taken into account in determining the redemption price at maturity of the Notes. However, due to the contingency the Notes could be considered “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case the redemption premium would be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gain and accruals of interest would be treated as OID. OID will be treated as ordinary income from sources outside of the United States. A cash basis U.S. Holder receiving interest in Euro must include in income a U.S. dollar amount based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt whether or not the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder generally must include in income a U.S. dollar amount based on the average exchange rate during the accrual period (or, for an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial accrual period within each taxable year). Upon receipt of a payment in Euro, U.S. Holders that have accrued interest or OID will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to any difference between the U.S. dollar amount accrued and the U.S. dollar value of the payment received at the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt.

Consequently, under Article 3 paragraph 2 of Regulation (EC) 1436/2000, absent any change in circumstances, the Issuers’ and certain Guarantors’ center of main interests at the time of an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is likely to be in Germany, and insolvency proceedings are likely to be initiated in Germany, in which case German insolvency law would govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as ----- well as security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency_ proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) any other company not having an_ individual as personally liable shareholder—such as in the case of the Issuers—gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within 3 weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor is likely to not be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—with this petition not being obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., incompetent and/or not disinterested). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duty of the preliminary insolvency administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the ----- occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9%. of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of the Issuers or under a guarantee granted by any German guarantor in full after the secured creditors have been satisfied. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige _Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured_ insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., these can be transferred to third-parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile, the court may grant a period of up to three months to utilize up an insolvency plan for the debtor business. During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator may avoid (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s right to avoid transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. ----- In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuers based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is avoided successfully, you may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes or collateral, the insolvency administrator may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases: - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be avoided if the act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was cash flow insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being cash flow insolvent (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggested such cash flow insolvency or filing); - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be avoided if the act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if the transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was cash flow insolvent, or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor; - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the debtor was insolvent and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being insolvent; - if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third party debt is regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be avoided unless it was effected earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after such filing can be avoided if the debtor acted with the intent to disadvantage its creditors and the beneficiary of the transaction had knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor is cash-flow insolvent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘affiliated party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it provided satisfaction, if the ----- transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). For purposes of the above, the knowledge of circumstances from which a compelling conclusion regarding the debtor’s insolvency or regarding the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings can be drawn, will be considered tantamount to the actual knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator avoiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. Finally, the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for restitution of a loan replacing equity capital or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Any guarantee and security interest granted by a German guarantor being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter _Haftung—“GmbH”) or a limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) is_ subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit _beschränkter Haftung—“GmbHG”)._ As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s, or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and security interests securing liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or a sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called—limitation language—in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of any subsidiary guarantee and security documents given by the German subsidiary incorporated as a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or as a German limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) will be limited if and to the extent payments under any such subsidiary guarantee or, as the case may be, the enforcement of security documents would cause the German subsidiary Guarantor’s (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets to fall below, or increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung _einer Unterbilanz) (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and_ ----- exemptions). Accordingly, any security and guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG incorporated or established in Germany will contain such limitation language in the manner described. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of any guarantee and security interest granted by a German guarantor being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in Germany in the form of a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—“AG”) or of any subsidiary of the AG are subject to certain provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz—“AktG”). As a general rule, section 71a of the AktG prohibits an AG such as Douglas Holding AG (and any of its subsidiaries) from making any payment, granting any loan, any security (including any guarantee) or any other benefit to any other person for the purpose of, with a view to or in support of, the (direct or indirect) acquisition of any shares in the AG. According to section 71a of the AktG any transaction or agreement providing for any such financial assistance would be held void. In addition, section 57 of the AktG prohibits an AG generally from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders or to its sister companies. Therefore, in order to enable a German subsidiary incorporated as an AG or subsidiaries of an AG to grant guarantees and security interests securing liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating sections 57 and 71a of the AktG and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain socalled—limitation language—in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of an AG (such as Douglas Holding AG) and any of the AG’s subsidiaries. Pursuant to such limitation language, the subsidiary guarantee and security documents given by the German subsidiary incorporated as an AG or any subsidiaries of an AG do not secure any liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company of the AG (or any of its subsidiaries) unless the AG is subject to a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as the dominated entity (beherrschtes Unternehmen) with a direct or indirect shareholder or any subsidiary of such shareholder (other than the AG and the subsidiaries of the AG) as the dominating entity (herrschendes Unternehmen). If the AG is subject to such a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement as the dominated entity, payments under the subsidiary guarantee or, as the case may be, the enforcement of security documents may be limited by reference to the dominating entity’s ability to compensate losses of the AG under the domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement due to the dominating entity’s solvency situation. Accordingly, any security and guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of an AG incorporated in Germany and any subsidiary of the AG will contain such limitation language in the manner described. These limitations would, to the extent applicable, restrict the right of payment and would limit the claim accordingly irrespective of the granting of the subsidiary guarantee or the security interests pursuant to the security documents. In addition, subsidiary guarantees in other jurisdictions may be subject to similar limitations. German capital maintenance and financial assistance rules and other restrictions referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the German subsidiary guarantors, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the German subsidiary guarantors to make payments on the subsidiary guarantees or of the secured parties to enforce any collateral. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (i.e. a situation where a managing director makes a payment to the GmbH’s shareholder which inevitably leads to the illiquidity of the GmbH) or a so-called—destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e. a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its payment obligations towards its creditors (or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner)) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a subsidiary guarantee or collateral granted by the German subsidiary guarantors or security provider. In such case, the amount of proceeds permitted or capable to be realized in an enforcement process may be (further) reduced (up to zero). According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German subsidiary guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such ----- intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned, and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interests. The accessory security interests will only be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, in contrast with holders of the Notes (the “Holders”), who are creditors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In order to allow the Holders to benefit from such accessory security interests, the accessory security interests will only secure a so-called ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent, rather than securing the Holders’ claims under the Notes and the Guarantees directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt, and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a theoretical legal claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that this concept will not be recognized by German courts or that the courts will eliminate or mitigate the validity or the enforceability of accessory security interests, and that the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may thus be restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The determination of where such company has its “center of main interests” is generally a question of fact on which the courts of different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static, but rather a fact and circumstances based concept and may hence change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as the location where board meetings are held and the location where the company conducts the majority of its business including the perception of the company’s creditors of the local center of the company’s business operations may all be relevant in determining where the company has its “center of main interests,” with the company’s “center of main interests” at the time of initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings being not only decisive for the international jurisdiction of the courts of a certain Member State, but also for the insolvency laws applicable to these insolvency proceedings as each court would, subject to certain exemptions, apply its local insolvency laws (lex fori concursus). If the center of main interests of such company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor located in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such issuer or guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. In the event that the Issuers or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuers and the collateral provided by the Issuers or any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

According to the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Law, a Polish subsidiary guarantor as a debtor will be declared bankrupt: (i) if it does not fulfill its due and payable pecuniary obligations (wymagalne zobowiązania _pienieżne); and/or (ii) if its obligations (zobowiązania) exceed the total value of its assets (majątek), even if it discharges_ these obligations on a current basis.

In the event of arrangement bankruptcy proceedings, the court appoints a court supervisor (nadzorca sądowy) or an administrator (zarządca) instead of the bankruptcy receiver. A court supervisor is appointed in a situation where the debtor will continue to manage its assets, whereas an administrator is appointed where the debtor is deprived of the right to manage its assets. If the creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and then approved by the court. The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed. The accepted arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors, whose receivables are covered by the arrangement. Certain receivables are not covered (affected) by the arrangement. These include, inter alia: (i) receivables secured with mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime pledges, however only up to the value of the collateral (to the extent they can be satisfied from a security assets on which such security was established); a creditor whose claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject to an arrangement, (ii) receivables under derivative or repo transactions, and (iii) receivables under employment contracts. Rules on which the bankrupt entity’s debts will be repaid are stipulated in the arrangement. The most typical arrangement involves a situation where the creditors are paid a portion of the debts and/or deferral of payments of such debts, and the company continues its operations. It is also possible, however, to accept a “liquidation arrangement” where a determination is made how the bankrupt entity’s assets and the business will be liquidated. The court may change the manner of conducting the bankruptcy proceedings from the arrangement bankruptcy proceedings into the liquidation proceedings and vice versa, if the grounds for conducting a given type of the proceedings have become known after the declaration of bankruptcy. Once bankruptcy is declared (irrespective of its type), the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject of security, charged with a pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to establish any security interests to secure the receivables incurred prior to the declaration of bankruptcy, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had been filled at least six months prior to filling the motion for bankruptcy. Contractual provisions which explicitly stipulate the contract amendment or termination in case bankruptcy by a contract party is declared are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the bankruptcy proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate. These specific provisions of Polish law are deemed to be forcing their jurisdiction with respect to provisions of the kind as referred to above also over contracts that are subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings under Polish bankruptcy law. If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy declaration in any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. If proceedings were pending in which the bankrupt entity was the plaintiff, the receiver or the administrator replaces the bankrupt entity. If a court supervisor is appointed, he acts together with the bankrupt entity in the proceedings. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables included in the arrangement by operation of law (in the case of arrangement bankruptcy) and/or any receivables which may be submitted within the bankruptcy proceedings (in case of liquidation proceedings) were pending against the bankrupt entity on the day of bankruptcy declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and proceeds received are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after the decision on the declaration of bankruptcy becomes final.

Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy of the company, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date of bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts following a bankruptcy proceeding. In case of liquidation bankruptcy, creditors under the Note Guarantees will be satisfied from the proceeds obtained from the sale of the Polish subsidiary guarantor’ assets.

The first three categories concern principally the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and payments to the state or concerning employees (official receiver’s fees, costs of liquidating the business, remuneration, health benefit payments and social security obligations concerning the employees, taxes, etc.), whereas the majority of unsecured commercial receivables are listed in the fourth category and interest from such receivables (older than one year) are listed in the fifth category. Within each category, each receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in such category. Also, Polish law does not require a bankruptcy administrator (zarzadca), court supervisor (nadzorca sadowy) and/or a court receiver (syndyk) (unless otherwise specifically stated, hereinafter, bankruptcy administrator shall include each of zarzadca, nadzorca sadowy and syndyk) to give effect to intercreditor arrangements such as subordination agreements.

Further, the judge commissioner may, under a motion from the bankruptcy estate administrator declare any encumbrances (security interest) established over the assets of the Polish subsidiary guarantor (such as mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, etc.) ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate, to the extent that the Polish subsidiary guarantor was not the personal (direct) obligor with respect to the underlying debt and if the encumbrance was established within one year prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Polish subsidiary guarantor bankrupt and the Polish subsidiary guarantor received no consideration or the consideration received was glaringly low compared to the value of the encumbrance. However, irrespective of the value of the consideration received, the judge commissioner will decide that the security interests established over the assets of the bankrupt entity are ineffective for the bankruptcy estate if they secure obligations of an entity related to the bankrupt entity: (i) the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s shareholders, their representatives and/or relatives; or (ii) affiliated companies, their shareholders, and/or representatives or relatives of such shareholders, and/or (iii) the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s subsidiary or holding companies. Under the Polish Civil Code, a creditor (or, if the debtor is declared bankrupt, the relevant bankruptcy officer) may request that the relevant Polish court declare a given legal act (e.g., the granting of a Note Guarantees) ineffective towards such creditor, and the court will do so if it finds that granting a Note Guarantees constituted a transaction effected by a debtor to the detriment of its creditors (i.e., where the debtor became insolvent or became insolvent to a greater extent as a result of the transaction) while a third party has gained a benefit, and provided that (i) the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment, and (ii) the third party knew or, had it acted with due diligence, could have known that the debtor was acting to the detriment of its other creditors (and the third party’s knowledge that the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment is presumed if the entrepreneur who received the benefit as a result of the transaction with the debtor remained in a permanent economic relationship with such debtor) or gave no consideration for the benefit obtained in such transaction. In addition, if a Polish subsidiary guarantor’s entering into a given agreement made it wholly or partially impossible to satisfy a third party’s claim, such third party may request that the court declare such an agreement ineffective towards that party, provided the Polish subsidiary guarantor and the other party to the agreement knew of the third party’s claim or if the agreement was for no consideration.

The act will replace the provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring law with respect to restructuring proceedings, while amending the provisions of the act in force relating to insolvency proceedings.

Restructuring proceedings will be available both to insolvent entities and those that are endangered with insolvency. Restructuring of a debtor’s business through settlement with creditors will be the key aim of the new law, while liquidation bankruptcy will be treated more as an option if restructuring is not possible. Some key specific amendments provided by the new act include: a) relaxation of the insolvency conditions—in particular future liabilities and liabilities under conditions precedent will not be taken into account for the purposes of the insolvency test and a corporate entity will become insolvent when the over-indebtedness continues for twenty four months; b) extension of prohibition on charging the bankrupt’s assets—once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be charged with a compulsory mortgage or a treasury pledge, even for securing the receivables incurred after the declaration of bankruptcy; c) invalidity of contractual provisions which explicitly stipulate the contract’s amendment or termination in the event of filing for or declaration of bankruptcy of a party to the contract; d) change of clawback provisions, providing in particular that: (i) a security granted within six months (instead of two months which currently applies) before the filing of the motion for declaration of bankruptcy to secure a debt which is not due (dług niewymagalny) will be deemed ineffective; however, the creditor may bring an action or charge in order to seek the recognition of the security as effective if at the time when the same was granted the creditor was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaration of bankruptcy of the grantor of the security; (ii) transfer of future receivables which arise after declaration of bankruptcy will be ineffective unless a transfer agreement is concluded in writing, with the date of conclusion officially confirmed (data pewna) and not later than six months before filing for bankruptcy; (iii) contractual penalties in the event of non-performance or improper performance of an obligation stipulated in contracts concluded before declaration of bankruptcy may be declared ineffective if a large part of the obligation was already performed by the bankrupt or if the amount of the contractual penalty is grossly exaggerated. e) Change to categories for satisfying creditors of receivables in liquidation bankruptcy.

In the event of insolvency of a Dutch company or a provider of security interests having its center of main interests in the Netherlands (each a “Dutch Provider”), any insolvency proceedings relating to the Dutch Provider would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law against companies that are not established under Dutch law provided that such company has an establishment in the Netherlands. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van _betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a_ going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of ----- the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder) and often also a supervisor judge (rechter-commissaris). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for moratorium of payments, a court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by a court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends as soon as a court’s decision becomes final. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law, secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in a moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, a court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will generally be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority of the meeting of the recognized and of the admitted creditors representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the admitted claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by a court. Under certain conditions, a court or judge commissioner (rechter-commissaris) (as the case may be) may derogate from this procedure. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the Holders to effect a restructuring. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain preferred creditors (such as the tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that are due and payable by their terms within one year of the date of the bankruptcy of the relevant guarantor or security grantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the bankruptcy trustee determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings to the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that would not have been payable within one year from the date of the bankruptcy may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatie vergadering), the receiver, the insolvent debtor and all provisionally verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). Such renvooi procedures could also cause payments to the Holders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As a moratorium of payments proceedings, in a bankruptcy a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall in general be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the meeting of unsecured non-preferential creditors, with admitted and provisionally admitted claims representing at least 50% of the total amount of the admitted and provisionally admitted unsecured non preferential claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under certain conditions, the supervisory judge (rechter- commissaris) may derogate from this procedure. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors which have a right in rem (goederenrechtelijke rechten) may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of four months during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. The bankruptcy trustee may force a secured creditor to realize its security right by giving the creditor ----- notice to do so within a reasonable time. A failure to take recourse by the creditor will result in the creditor forfeiting its rights to enforce its security rights, albeit that its claim shall continue to be preferred. However, in such an event the creditor must contribute to costs of the bankruptcy which may be considerable. Any excess proceeds of enforcement and for which there is no valid security right must be returned to the bankruptcy estate and may not be off set to any unsecured claims against the debtor. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, the provision of security or an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its bankruptcy trustee, if (i) it performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration (om niet)) the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In addition, in the case of such a bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may nullify the debtor’s performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors. Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets, will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankrupt estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by a bankrupt guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated different from creditors that are incorporated or residing in the Netherlands.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In determining whether the granting of such guarantee or security interest is in the interest of the relevant company, the Dutch Courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but all relevant circumstances including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee or security interest, then such company (and its bankruptcy receiver) may contest the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeable be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects. Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a security document may be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden) and other defenses afforded by Netherlands law to obligors generally. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling); furthermore, under Netherlands law, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the exception non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise. Under Dutch rules on financial assistance, a company may not grant guarantees or collateral with a view to the acquisition of its shares by a third party. This prohibition also applies to any subsidiaries of the relevant company (including foreign subsidiaries). It is generally assumed that a guarantee or collateral which violates Dutch financial assistance rules prohibitions is null and void. More specifically, if a guarantee or collateral partly violates financial assistance prohibitions, the guarantee or collateral will be void for that part. In addition, there is a risk that the void part ----- will contaminate the remainder of the guarantee or collateral so that, from a Dutch law perspective, the guarantee or collateral is void in its entirety. In order to enable Dutch subsidiaries to grant guarantees or other collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Dutch rules on financial assistance, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in the Netherlands. Pursuant to such limitation language, it is agreed between the relevant parties that such guarantee or collateral is deemed not to be given to the extent the same would constitute a violation of the Dutch rules on financial assistance. Such limitation language will also be included in the guarantee and security documents granted by any Dutch Provider. Legislation which abolishes the financial assistance prohibition came into force on October 1, 2012. There is no transitional law included in the new legislation and therefore the financial assistance prohibition for private companies with limited liability (besloten vennootschappen met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) has ceased to exist as per October 1, 2012. To the extent any agreement, articles of association, security documents or any other document refer to “Section 2:207c Dutch _Civil Code” only or do not contain any reference to financial assistance, the prohibition has ceased as per October 1,_ 2012. However, to the extent any agreement, articles of association, security documents or any other document has reflected in it the literal text of Section 2:207c Dutch Civil Code or similar provision, such provision will continue to apply as a contractual matter between parties regardless the abolishment of the financial assistance itself. Pursuant to Dutch law it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the security documents pursuant to which a security interest will be granted in the assets of the Dutch subsidiaries use a parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch subsidiaries, as separate and independent obligations, undertake to pay to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a Dutch court and we cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law. Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by the any Dutch Guarantor under a guarantee or security interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such guarantee or security interest. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in, any Dutch Guarantors may also be successfully contested by the any Dutch Guarantors (or their receiver in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of our Dutch subsidiaries under a guarantee or security interest may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the subsidiaries’ respective receiver in bankruptcy when the subsidiary is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Netherlands Civil Code and Netherlands Bankruptcy Act are met. As a result, the value of the guarantee and security interests provided by the Dutch Guarantors may be limited. Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its receiver in bankruptcy (curator) if the objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Netherlands Supreme Court (Hoge Raad _der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity are transgressed, not only the_ description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association (statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is jeopardized by the transaction. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant security document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. ----- If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under such Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over the collateral, or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Note Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694
119_1,Offerings 2015.md,1202,POLAND,1202.9,,1202.9.1,,"One of the Guarantors is incorporated in Poland (the “Polish subsidiary guarantor”) in the form of a limited liability company (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością). Consequently, its obligations under the Note Guarantees and security interests are subject to limitations resulting from the application of laws on bankruptcy and insolvency, and the laws on restructuring proceedings, as set out in the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act (Prawo Upadłościowe i _Naprawcze) of February 28, 2003 (Journal of Laws of 2012, item 1112, as amended) (the “Polish Bankruptcy and_ Restructuring Law”). Specifically, pursuant to Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act, a corporate entity is deemed to be insolvent if its obligations (zobowiązania) exceed the value of its assets (property) (majątek), even if it discharges those obligations on a current basis. Given certain legal controversies regarding the application of this rule, and in order to mitigate the possibility that the Polish subsidiary guarantor could be declared bankrupt under this rule, the liability of any Guarantor incorporated under Polish law on account of payments under the Note Guarantees shall be limited to the amount equivalent to the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s assets. The Note Guarantees by these companies are also subject to certain provisions of the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000 (Journal of Laws of 2013, item 1030, as amended) (the “Polish Commercial Companies Code”). In accordance with Article 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, shareholders of a limited liability company (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością) may not receive, on whatever account, payments out of a company’s assets which are necessary for the initial capital to be fully paid up. Article 189 sec. 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code prohibits the return of capital, either full or partial, to such shareholders. In the Polish legal doctrine opinions are expressed that in certain situations payment by a company under a guarantee may constitute in fact the return of capital to a shareholder. This issue is not clearly regulated in Poland and must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, subject to such limitations and risks. ----- Therefore, in order to enable Polish subsidiary guarantor to grant guarantees and security interests securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating Polish law provisions and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to include socalled “limitation language”. Pursuant to such limitation language the obligations and liabilities of each Polish subsidiary guarantor will be limited to the extent required so that such obligations do not and cannot result in: - a reduction of the assets required for the coverage of the total nominal capital as defined in, or a repayment of capital as prohibited under Article 189 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code; and - insolvency as defined by Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act. The limitations described above will not apply if one or more of the following circumstances occurs: - an Event of Default occurred under the applicable Indenture in respect of which an acceleration notice has been delivered to the relevant Polish subsidiary guarantor by the applicable trustee under the applicable Indenture irrespective of whether such Event of Default occurs before or after the relevant Polish subsidiary guarantor becomes insolvent within the meaning of Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act; - the liabilities of the relevant Polish subsidiary Guarantor (other than those under the applicable Indenture or in any other documents relating to the relevant Notes) result in its insolvency within the meaning of Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act; or - Polish law is amended in a such manner that over-indebtedness defined in Art. 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act (as in force on the date of the applicable Indenture) no longer gives grounds for declaration of bankruptcy or obliges the representatives of the relevant Polish subsidiary guarantor to file our bankruptcy. Finally, maximum interest rate per annum permitted pursuant to Article 359 sec. 2[1] of the Polish Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) of April 23, 1964 (Journal of Laws 2014 item 121, as amended) (the “Polish Civil Code”) is equal to four times the “lombard” rate of the National Bank of Poland. Therefore, the Polish subsidiary guarantor potentially could not be held liable for interest exceeding such maximum interest rate set by the Polish Civil Code.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions of counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased to a certain extent or the offering may be terminated. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that appear on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the prices at which the Notes are offered and other selling terms of the Notes may be varied by the Initial Purchasers from time to time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to prospective investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuers and the Guarantors have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. The Issuers and the Guarantors have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers, the Guarantors providing the Senior Notes Issue Date Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date Guarantees and (as of the Completion Date) the Guarantors providing the Senior Note Guarantees and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 60 days after the closing of the Offerings without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as representative for the Initial Purchasers.

Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.” Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not U.S. registered broker-dealers and, therefore, to the extent that they intend to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the Regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuers have applied, through their listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the Global Exchange Market, however, the Issuers cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about July 10, 2015, which will be nine business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + 9”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the following five business days will be required by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T + 9, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering ----- transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading _market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or commercial banking services to us and/or our affiliates (or former affiliates) in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and have provided certain debt financing commitments to provide financing for the Acquisition in the event the Offerings are not consummated, and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities and reimbursement expenses. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch will also act as Security Agent for the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch is acting as agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and UniCredit Bank AG or their respective affiliates are also advising CVC in connection with the Acquisition. J.P. Morgan Limited and Goldman Sachs International acted as financial advisors to Advent International in relation to the sale of Douglas to CVC. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also enter into hedging arrangements with us in connection with the Transactions. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, which may include the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

119_1,Offerings 2015.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on the state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - the judgment being final under U.S. law; - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law; - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint; - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court; - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the procedure of a matter pending before a German court, provided that such matter was pending before a German court before the U.S. court entered its judgment; - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with German public policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is doubtful whether a German court would impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Germany based solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws. German courts also usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages as incompatible with the substantive foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent court of the Netherlands. The relevant Netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of a U.S. Court as it deems appropriate. Based on case law, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to recognize the binding effect of a final, conclusive and enforceable money judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the U.S. without re-examination or re-litigation of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, provided that (i) the relevant U.S. Court had jurisdiction in the matter in accordance with standards which are generally accepted internationally, (ii) the proceedings before such court complied with principles of proper procedure and (iii) such judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the Netherlands.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

There is no treaty between the United States of America and Poland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, to judgments of U.S. courts, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure shall apply. Those rules provide for enforcement of foreign judgments concerning matters which may be settled by Polish civil courts if the judgment is enforceable in the country where it has been rendered. In addition the following requirements must be satisfied: - the judgment is final in the jurisdiction in which it was issued; - the case does not belong to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts; - no summons has been served on the defendant, who was not engaged in the dispute on the matter, in due time for his defense; - the party has not been deprived of the possibility of defending itself in judicial proceedings; - a case regarding the same claim between the same parties was not pending in Poland earlier than before a court of the foreign country; - the judgment is not contrary to an earlier final judgment of a Polish court or an earlier final judgment of a foreign court satisfying the conditions for its recognition in Poland, which was rendered in a case regarding the same claim between the same parties; and - the judgment is not contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of Poland. Certain judgments of U.S. courts (or parts of thereof) may not be recognized as enforceable by Polish courts, or they may prove to be unenforceable in practice despite having been recognized as enforceable, in particular: (i) certain forms of specific performance might not be common in Poland, (ii) certain forms (or amounts) or damages or indemnities, in particular, punitive damages or other similar damages or indemnities might be found too excessive. Judgments (or parts of thereof) adjudicating such forms of specific performance or damages or indemnities may be considered as contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of the Republic of Poland. -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The accounting and valuation principles as well as the consolidation principles are consistent with those principles applied to the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2014. Any sales-related, seasonal or cyclical issues have been deferred during the fiscal year in accordance with sound business judgment. Sales and profit of the first half of the fiscal year are disproportionately affected by the Christmas shopping season. Given that the Easter business was earlier than the prior year, the Group companies were already able to report higher sales as of March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year period. The financial statements of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements were prepared uniformly using IFRS classification, accounting and measurement principles. Any accounting and valuation principles varying from the Group uniform standards have been accounted for in the separate preparation of the HGB balance sheet (HB II). At the end of the fiscal year 2013/14, management decided to limit the operating business of the Beauty Holding Zero Group to the Perfumeries segment (continued operations) and to sell the segments Books, Jewelry, Fashion as well as Douglas Corporate Service GmbH (discontinued operations). The discontinued segments Books (Thalia), Jewelry (Christ) and Fashion (AppelrathCüpper) were sold to a related company as of October 1, 2014. Jewelry was subsequently sold to a third-party company. In order to strengthen the branch network and to extend the market share the Group acquired the five perfumeries of Himmer in Germany as of January 1, 2015. In France, it acquired the 43 stores of the Clin d’Oeil chain in February 2015. Both acquisitions were conducted as asset deals. They primarily acquired property, plant and equipment (1.6 million EUR), inventory (4.8 million EUR), financial assets (0.4 million EUR), provisions (0.1 million EUR) and employees. Preliminary a goodwill of 21.1 million EUR has been capitalized. The purchase price allocations for both acquisitions were not yet finalized as of the balance sheet date. The purchase price for these acquisitions totaled 27.8 million EUR. The sales of the newly acquired branches contributed 4.6 million EUR to Group sales and generated EBT of (0.1) million EUR. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income are presented as segment performance indicators. EBITDA and net income have been adjusted for one off items and items which have an impact limited to a certain period of time determined by Douglas management. The adjustments mainly comprise effects from Nocibé purchase price allocation, deconsolidation of the jewellery, books and fashion business, consulting fees in relation to the acquisition and the sale of businesses and the envisaged initial public offering, costs in connection with restructuring and efficiency programs as well as ongoing consulting costs in connection with financing agreements. Further adjustments concern ongoing, disputed lease contracts and revaluation effects of inventories and trade receivables. In the first half of the fiscal year 2014/15 and in the same period in the prior year, the Douglas Group had the following business relationships with related parties from delivery and supply relationships concluded in the past:",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The fair value measurement of these interest swaps comes under the second category of IFRS 13 and is therefore based on directly observed market data.

The preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, is the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the consolidated interim financial statements based on our review. We conducted our review of the consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with the German Generally Accepted Standards for the review of financial statements (IDW PS 900 promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review such that we can preclude through critical evaluation, with a certain level of assurance, that the consolidated interim financial statements have not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance with the IFRS applicable to interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company employees and analytical assessments and therefore does not provide the assurance attainable in a financial statement audit. Since, in accordance with our engagement, we have not performed a financial statement audit, we cannot issue an auditor’s report. Based on our review no matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated interim financial statements have not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance with those IFRS applicable to interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU.

General principles,2425.67.1,,"The consolidated financial statements of the retail group Beauty Holding Zero GmbH, based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014 have been prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union, taking into account all mandatory standards and interpretations in effect at the closing date. The Beauty Holding Zero Group was formed on December 1, 2012 with the acquisition of the shares in Douglas Holding AG. At this time, Douglas Holding AG managed a group of companies that operated retail stores in the fields of Perfumery, Books, Jewelry, Fashion and Confectionery. Prior to December 1, 2012, the Beauty Holding Group was limited to three non-operating companies. The comparative prior year figures for the operating business therefore cover a period of only ten months (December 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013) and are thus not comparable with the figures for current years. The companies of French perfumery chain Nocibé were acquired by the end of June 2014. The expenses and income of these companies were included in the Beauty Holding Group for the period from July 1 to September 30, 2014. The inclusion of the Nocibé companies also limits the comparability of figures with the prior year. At the end of the fiscal year 2013/14, management decided to restrict the operations of the Beauty Holding Zero Group to the Perfumery division (continued operation) and to sell off the Books, Jewelry and Fashion divisions (discontinued operations). The Confectionery division had already been sold on April 30, 2014. For this reason, the details in the statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, Cash Flow statement and in the Notes mainly relate to the continued operations. The discontinued operations are reported separately in condensed form in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5. The prior-year figures for the comprehensive income statement and the Cash Flow statement as well as expense and income-related information in the Notes have been adjusted accordingly. The financial statements of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements were prepared uniformly according to applicable principles for IFRS classification, accounting and measurement.

July 1, is used as the acquisition date. Nocibé operates a total of 373 perfumery retail stores in France and thus complements the internationally operated Douglas stores of Beauty Holding Zero. The Nocibé brand is in continued use in France; the stores previously operated under the name Douglas were renamed Nocibé. The acquisition has significantly increased the market share in France. The purchase price amounted to 165.2 million EUR and was fully paid in cash. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Nocibé brand was valued at 139.6 million EUR and recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, within intangible assets, the customer base was capitalized at an amount of 17.5 million EUR and advantageous rental agreements were capitalized at 1.6 million EUR. Furthermore, the purchase price allocation led to the recognition of hidden reserves on inventories of 32.4 million EUR. Alltogether deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 67.7 million EUR were recognized on these in the consolidated balance sheet. A remaining amount of 277.6 million EUR was capitalized as goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill is derived as a residual amount if there are no further identifiable assets in the acquired company that can be identified as separable and measured reliably. Since July 1, 2014, the acquired companies have generated sales of 101.2 million EUR and earnings before taxes of (10.8) million EUR. If the companies of the Nocibé Group had already been included in the Beauty Holding Group for the full fiscal year 2013/14, they would have contributed 502.3 million EUR to sales and 11.4 million EUR to earnings before taxes.

Accounting and valuation principles,2425.81.1,Intangible assets,"Goodwill arising from capital consolidation, that represents the excess of acquisition cost over the Fair Value of identifiable net assets acquired, is recognized according to the requirements of IFRS 3 and tested for impairment annually or in case of a triggering event. For the purposes of the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the group of ----- cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to profit from synergies arising from the acquisition. The Beauty Holding Zero Group views the individual retail store or online shop as the CGU. The ceiling for allocation of goodwill is generally the operating segment. In the Beauty Holding Zero Group, this is one of the four regions Germany, France, South Western Europe or Eastern Europe. If, within the scope of this impairment test, the company ascertains that the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill allocated to the CGU is written down and recognized in profit or loss. The diminished carrrying amount is maintained even if the reasons for impairment cease to exist in subsequent periods. Other intangible assets are carried at cost. Borrowing costs are not included when calculating acquisition costs, because there are no qualifying assets in the Beauty Holding Group. Intangible assets with finite useful lifes are subject to straight line amortization over their useful life. If their useful life cannot be determined, these intangible assets are not subject to scheduled amortization. These assets are then reviewed for impairment at least once a year. If the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount, it is written down to its Fair Value. If the reasons for write-downs made in prior years no longer apply, the assets are written up.

Investment subsidies received reduce the cost at which the asset for which the subsidy was granted is recognised. Borrowing costs are not included when calculating acquisition costs for property, plant and equipment, but are immediately expensed to the income statement, because there are no qualifying assets in the Beauty Holding Group. Since, based on experience, the restoration obligations of Beauty Holding Group’s companies are not called upon, these obligations are generally not recognized in the acquisition costs of the leasehold improvements. In the year of purchase, property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis. Where indications of impairment exist, an impairment test is conducted for the corresponding asset. Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognized when removed or further economic benefits are no longer expected from the asset’s use.

Within the Beauty Holding Group material lease arrangements predominantly relate to the leasing of company stores. Leases are recognized in the balance sheet according to the requirements of IAS 17. In order to ensure the greatest possible flexibility, the Group generally aims to conclude rental agreements with a fixed rental period of no more than ten years and single or multiple exercisable options to extend the lease. In classifying lease agreements, consideration is given to the basic lease term and the exercise of any renewal option on the basis of knowledge acquired in the past, which leads to these leases generally qualifying as operating leases because the fixed lease term plus renewal option does not exceed the significant part of the economic useful life of the rented premises. If the economic ownership of leased assets are allocated to the Beauty Holding Group, the leased assets are capitalized at the inception of the lease and subject to scheduled straight-line depreciation in subsequent periods. At inception of the lease, the leased asset is recognized at the Fair Value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. On the other hand, the financial obligations that result from future lease payments are recognized as a liability in the same amount.

Provisions are recognized if there is a legal or constructive obligation to third parties arising from past events and the future cash outflow to fulfill this commitment can be reliably estimated. The carrying amount of the provision is based—for individual risks—on the best estimate of the settlement taking into account all recognizable risks, or—for a large population of risks—the amount computed according to the expected value method. Non-current provisions are carried on the balance sheet at their present value as of the balance sheet date. The maturity of long-term personnel provisions is dependent on the date of dismissal of the employee or rather the forecasted cash outflows. The maturity of long-term provisions for real estate is based on the duration of the lease contract or the estimated date of an early termination of the lease contract. Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized if a constructive obligation to restructure was formalized by means of the adoption of a detailed restructuring plan and its communication to those affected as of the closing date. Restructuring provisions comprise only obligatory restructuring expenses. Provisions for pensions are accounted for in line with the requirements of IAS 19. Actuarial calculations for provisions for defined benefit plans use the projected unit credit method. As part of this measurement, the pensions and entitlements known on the balance sheet date are taken into account as well as the increases in salaries and pensions to be expected in future. For funded pension plans, the same interest rate is used to determine interest expenses resulting from the measurement of obligations and to calculate interest income from plan assets. If changes to these assumptions used in the calculations result in differences between the identified pension obligations and the pension obligations determined as of the balance sheet date, actuarial gains or losses will be incurred. These actuarial gains or losses as well as other valuation adjustments are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income.

Derivative financial instruments are neither used nor issued for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at Fair Value, which correspond to market value, both upon initial and subsequent measurement in accordance with IAS 39 and can result in a positive or negative value. Gains and losses from Fair Value measurement, to the extent that these correspond to designated derivative financial instruments qualifying as hedged items to hedge against Cash Flow risks, are recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item in line with the rules for hedge accounting. Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedged items are measured at Fair Value and recognized in the income statement. Deferred taxes arising from the difference between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base are also recognized directly to equity under a separate equity item if the Fair Value differences were also recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item. The amounts recorded under equity increase or reduce profit or loss as soon as the hedged Cash Flows from the underlying transaction are recognized in the income statement. The Fair Value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to the amount to be either paid or received by the Group company upon termination of the financial instrument on the balance sheet date. The calculation of the Fair Value takes into account the interest rates and forward rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. The recording of ----- changes in the Fair Value depends on the use that is made of the derivative financial instrument. Where the derivative financial instrument is not used in an effective hedging relationship, the change in Fair Value is immediately recognized to profit or loss. If, on the other hand, an effective hedging relationship exists, it is recorded as such. The Beauty Holding Group only implements derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments as part of Cash Flow hedges. By way of such Cash Flow hedges, the Beauty Holding Group hedges the exposure to future variability in Cash Flows attributable to interest rate risks. In the case of a Cash Flow hedge, the effective portion of the value change in the hedging instruments is recognized directly to equity until the result arising from the underlaying transaction is recognized. In addition, non-derivative financial liabilities are used as part of net investment hedges implemented to cover currency rate risks arising from net investments in non-Group foreign currencies.

Trade tax rates are based on the rate-multiplyers of the municipalities in which the respective companies generate their revenue. For the Beauty Holding Zero Group companies based in Germany, the applicable trade tax rates are between 7 percent and 16 percent, which results in a total tax rate of between 23 percent and 32 percent. Including trade tax and the solidarity surcharge, this resulted in a total tax rate of 32 percent. Deferred taxes for the German Group companies were also generally measured at 32 percent. For foreign companies, a country-specific average tax rate is generally applied. Deferred taxes are measured based on the respective specific corporate tax rate. Other income includees deferred tax income in the amount of 1.4 million EUR (prior year: expense of 0.4 million EUR) recognized in the reserve for pension provisions as well as deferred tax income of 0.8 million EUR (September 30, 2013: 0.7 million EUR) in the Cash Flow hedge.

No deferred tax assets were recognized for tax loss carryforwards of the Group companies from continued operations totaling 102.5 million EUR (September 30, 2013: 106.4 million EUR). Total tax losses carried forward of 1.0 million EUR (September 30, 2013: 0.3 million EUR), for which no deferred tax assets had been capitalized, were utilized in the fiscal year. The applicable tax rate used for the purposes of tax reconciliation has been calculated on the basis of the average effective corporate tax rates of the respective Group companies. The applicable average tax rate used in the fiscal year 2013/14 amounted to 25.8 percent and to 20.0 percent in the prior year.

Scheduled depreciation and amortization in discontinued operations amounted to 39.0 million EUR (2012/13: EUR 36.8 million). Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment at store level as cash generating units (CGUs), led to write-downs totaling 1.4 million EUR (2012/13: 4.6 million EUR) for the continued operations in the fiscal year under review. Ongoing negative contributions towards profits and the intended closure of stores trigger the performance of impairment tests on the CGUs. As part of impairment testing, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as being the value in use of the future Cash Flows based on internal forecasts. Sensitivity planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit forecasts, estimates of replacement investments in the store network, and the ratio of personnel expenses to sales on the basis of individual stores. The forecasts are based on the fixed term of the respective lease agreements. The forecast period is between one and ten years. Calculations are based on interest rates of between 7.5 percent and 16.7 percent (2012/13: 7.3 percent and 18.8 percent) before taxes. The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lifes, amounts to a total of 1,190.8 million EUR. This amount includes 525.8 million EUR in goodwill in the Perfumery division, 277.8 million EUR of which is attributable to the French perfumery chain Nocibé that was acquired in the past fiscal year. A further 488.2 million EUR is attributable to the Douglas brand and 139.6 million EUR to the Nocibé brand. In addition, location advantages associated with the leasehold interests that were purchased from the prior tenant are capitalized. The useful life of these assets is independent of the term of the rental agreement. A total of 34.7 million EUR is attributable to various locations in France and 2.5 million EUR to one location in Vienna. In the prior year, the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lifes amounted to 891.9 million EUR. This amount included goodwill attributable to discontinued operations in the amount of 70.4 million EUR as well brands in the amount of 72.7 million EUR. In the prior year, goodwill was allocated to the former Perfumery, Book, Jewelry, Fashion and Confectionery segments. In line with the focus on the perfumery business, new regional segments were created within the Perfumery Division in fiscal year 2013/14. The goodwill allocated to the Douglas perfumeries in the prior year was reallocated to the new regional operating segments according to their profitability. The carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date amounted to 156.6 million EUR for Germany, 11.8 million EUR for France, 51.5 million EUR for South Western Europe and 28.0 million EUR for Eastern Europe. The total goodwill attributable to France including Nocibé amounts to 289.6 million EUR. The four regional segments are the basis for the annual impairment testing of goodwill. The Beauty Holding Zero Group has been pursuing a two-brand strategy since the acquisition of the Nocibé Group. In the regions ----- Germany, South Western Europe and Eastern Europe, products are marketed under the Douglas brand, whereas the Nocibé brand is exclusively used in France. According to IAS 36, existing goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year. As it is the case for impairment tests for tangible assets, the carrying amount of the CGUs is compared with the recoverable amount of the CGUs, with the recoverable amount in the Beauty Holding Group being defined as the value in use based on the discounted future Cash Flows from the internal forecast. Sensitivity planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit forecasts, estimates of replacement investments in the store network, and the ratio of EBITDA to sales. The forecasts are based on both internal company estimates and experience values as well as external macroeconomic data. The forecasts were developed on the basis of actual historic values and take into account an increase in sales for the operating segments of 2.0 percent annually as well as a marginal rise in profitability. The forecasted sales increase is expected mainly in the e-commerce division, which saw above-average growth rates in recent years. An increase in profitability between 0.0 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, depending on the segment, is expected in the medium term due to the use of synergy effects. Forcasts do not comprise future measures and business expansions. The forecasts are based on detailed forecast periods of four years, which corresponds to the companies’ standardized forecasting system, and a subsequent constant perpetual annuity. The calculations are based on a riskadjusted growth rate of 1.0 percent. For discounting purposes, interest rates of 7.49 percent and 7.99 percent after tax were applied, which correspond to interest rates of 11.0 percent and 11.75 percent before taxes. Impairment testing applied to goodwill did not lead to any impairments in the fiscal year under review. Leaseholds of 0.9 million EUR were subject to impairment in fiscal year 2012/13. In addition to the impairment tests, sensitivity analyses were performed. Regarding goodwill of the individual divisions, impairment requirements would arise if, the following parameters were used instead in the calculation with at least the following amounts, assuming all other parameters remain unchanged.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Individual companies also have access to bilateral credit lines, of which 10.4 million EUR had been utilized as of the balance sheet date. Beauty Holding One GmbH is financed through fixed-interest shareholder loans repayable on maturity, which amounted to 594.1 million EUR including accrued interest as of September 30, 2014. Interest on this loan amounts to 9.68 percent. The interest increases the original loan amount every year and is due when the loan matures in December 2022 or June 2024 respectively. After the balance sheet date, it was agreed that the purchase prices realized from the sale of Christ, Thalia and AppelrathCüpper in the amount of 459.3 million EUR would be used to redeem the shareholder loans. Following repayment, shareholder loans in the amount of 134.8 million EUR remain outstanding. Beauty Holding Zero and its subsidiaries have to meet certain obligations and key financial covenants, an interest cover (EBITDA in relation to financing expenses), a leverage cover (relation of net debt to adjusted EBITDA), a Cash Flow cover (Cash Flow in relation to debt servicing), and a capex cover (ceiling for investments). If these obligations are not met, the lenders are entitled to cancel the loan agreements with immediate effect and call upon all pledged collateral. The financial covenants are calculated on a quarterly basis and tested annually. All agreed financial covenants were adhered to in the fiscal year 2013/14. A compliance certificate was issued to the lenders ----- in connection with this. The Executive Board of Douglas Holding AG estimates that the risk of any financial covenants not being adhered to in the fiscal year 2014/15 is low. All of the German subsidiaries in the Perfumery division, the service companies and some subsidiaries based abroad, are linked to a cash management system (cash pooling). By combining financing volumes, short-term liquidity surpluses of individual Group companies can be used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies. This leads to a reduction in borrowing and an optimizing of cash investments, thus having a positive impact on the Group’s net interest result.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

To reduce the risk of Cash Flow fluctuations due to changes in the interest rates of the variable loans, two-thirds of the nominal amounts of the loans taken out in 2012 were hedged against interest rate risks.

Differences arising from the translation of foreign currencies to the parent’s currency for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements did not impact currency risk. In order to hedge the residual currency risks, DOUGLAS HOLDING AG’s financial management regularly reviews the Beauty Holding Group’s currency items and analyzes the pros and cons of implementing derivative financial instruments. Within the scope of IFRS 7, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for foreign currency risks. As part of this analysis, the effects from foreign currency positions, which are measured at the closing date rate pursuant to IAS 21, are included. With respect to the currency risks, the sensitivity analysis is presented as follows: the effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in financial instruments denominated in foreign currency but not designated as hedged items as part of foreign currency hedging transactions have been included in the sensitivity analysis. In view of the result of the income statement, the Beauty Holding Group would be exposed to a net risk of (0.3) million EUR—as in the prior year—based on an appreciation in value of the Euro currency of 5 percent. A devaluation in the Euro of 5 percent would have the opposite effect in the same amount. This effect is also equivalent to the prior-year figure.

At the same time, the volume is also distributed amongst several contracting parties in order to avoid a concentration of risks. On account of the difficult global economic situation, larger monetary deposits are avoided or only opened with first-rated German banks. ----- Arising from the increased focus of the distribution channel on the Internet, the companies of the Beauty Holding Group are faced with a receivables default risk, which is a system-inherent risk in mail ordering.

This analysis was based on the following assumptions: Non-derivative financial instruments are only subject to interest rate risk, which is reflected in the financial result or equity, if they have been measured at Fair Value. Financial instruments measured at cost are not subject to any interest rate risks. Financial instruments with variable interest rates are subject to interest rate risks if they were not designated as the underlying transaction in a Cash Flow hedge. A relative increase in interest rates by 100 basis points would lead to an increase in interest expense of 5.5 million EUR. Of this amount, 2.8 million EUR was attributable to the loan taken out in the prior fiscal year in the amount of 275 million EUR, which was not hedged against using interest rate swaps. The corresponding interest rate risk in the prior year was 2.7 million EUR. If the EURIBOR were to be lowered to 0.0 percent, interest income would improve by 1.2 million EUR, of which 0.6 million EUR is attributable to the loan of 275 million EUR that was taken out in the prior year.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a (1) HGB are the responsibility of the parent company’s Board of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and German Generally Accepted Standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the company’s Board of Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a (1) HGB, and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Accounting and valuation principles,1368.62.1,Intangible assets,"Goodwill that arises as part of capital consolidation, and that represents the excess of the cost of the business combination over the company’s interest in the net Fair Value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary, is capitalized according to the requirements of IFRS 3 and subject to an annual impairment test and whenever there are triggering events indicating impairment. For the purposes of the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the group of cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to profit from synergies arising from the acquisition. The Beauty Holding Zero Group generally views the individual retail store or online shop as the CGU. The ceiling for the allocation is generally the operating segment in conformity with IFRS 8.5. The Group’s operating segments are the five Perfumeries, Books, Jewelry, Fashion, and Confectionery Divisions. If, within the scope of this impairment test, the company ascertains that the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill allocated to the CGU is written down and recognized to profit or loss. This measurement is maintained even if the reasons for impairment cease to exist in subsequent periods. Other intangible assets are carried at cost. If qualifying assets with a production time of more than twelve months are acquired, borrowing costs will also be included when calculating acquisition costs. Intangible assets with finite useful lifes are subject to scheduled straight line amortization over their useful life. If they have an indefinite useful life, these intangible assets are not subject to scheduled amortization. These assets are reviewed for impairment at least once a year. If the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount, it is written down to its Fair Value. If the reasons for write-downs made in prior years no longer apply, the assets are written up. Intangible assets that are subject to scheduled amortization are only subject to an impairment test if there are triggering events indicating impairment. Goodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognized and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in the income statement. The Nocibé Group has been built from various acquisitions. However the Group does not monitor existing goodwill at the store level. The stores are indeed not independent from each other as their operating performance is largely affected by strategic decisions managed centrally: Sale prices are decided at the Group level and are the same for all stores. Assortments to be displayed in stores are defined, along with marketing strategy and operations, at the Group level. Recruitment and incentives for store staff are managed centrally. All negotiations with suppliers including rebates and bonuses are managed centrally. This is why the Group is considered as the one and only Cash Generating Unit for impairment testing purpose. The value in use is then derived from an estimated projection of the Group future operating performance. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any impairment is recognized immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. The discount rate used for the purpose of impairment testing is the Weighted Average Capital Cost (WACC). Other intangible assets are carried at cost. ----- These Intangible assets (goodwill and leasehold rights) with indefinite useful lifes are reviewed for impairment at least once a year and depreciated if necessary.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The Group does not utilize the option of the revaluation method. Investment ----- subsidies received reduce that asset’s cost for which the subsidy was granted. As a rule, borrowing costs are not included when calculating acquisition costs for property, plant and equipment, but are immediately expensed to the income statement, because there are no qualifying assets in the Beauty Holding Group. Since, based on experience, the Beauty Holding Group’s companies are not claimed for restoration obligations, these obligations are generally not recognized in the acquisition costs of the leasehold improvements. In the year of purchase, property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis. Where indications of impairment exist, an impairment test is conducted for the corresponding asset. The impairment tests conducted for this purpose are generally performed on the basis of the CGU, which in the case of property, plant and equipment, is the individual retail store. Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognized when removed or further economic benefits are no longer expected from that asset’s use. The gain or loss from the disposal of the asset arises from the difference between its net realizable value and carrying amount. The amortization and depreciation periods for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are determined based on their useful lifes as follows: If items of property, plant and equipment are used for longer than one year, these are carried at cost less scheduled straight-line depreciation. In the year of purchase, property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis.

Material lease arrangements predominantly relate to the leasing of company stores within the Beauty Holding Group. Leases are recognized in the balance sheet according to the requirements of IAS 17. In order to ensure the greatest possible flexibility, the Group generally aims to conclude rental agreements with a fixed rental period of no more than ten years and single or multiple exercisable options to extend the lease. In classifying lease agreements, consideration is given to the basic lease term and the exercise of any renewal options on the basis of knowledge acquired in the past, which means that these agreements regularly qualify as operating leases. If the economic ownership of leased assets can be allocated to the Beauty Holding Group, the leased assets are capitalized at the inception of the lease and subject to scheduled straight-line depreciation in subsequent periods. At the commencement of the lease, the leased asset is recognized at the Fair Value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.

Provisions are recognized if there is a legal or constructive obligation to third parties arising from past events and the future cash outflow to fulfill this commitment can be reliably estimated. The carrying amount of the provision is based—for individual risks—on the best estimate of the settlement taking into account all recognizable risks, or—for a large population of risks—the amount computed according to the expected value method. Non-current provisions are carried on the balance sheet at their present value as of the balance sheet date. The maturity of long-term human resources commitments is based on the date of dismissal of the employee or forecasted cash outflows. The maturity of long-term real estate commitments is based on the duration of the lease contract or the estimated date of an early termination of the lease contract. Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized if a constructive obligation to restructure was formalized by means of the adoption of a detailed restructuring plan and its communication vis-à-vis those affected as of the closing date.

Derivative financial instruments are neither used nor issued for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at Fair Value, which correspond to market value, both upon initial and subsequent measurement in accordance with IAS 39; and can result in a positive or negative figure. Gains and losses from Fair Value measurement, to the extent that these are designated derivative financial instruments qualifying as hedged items to hedge against Cash Flow risks, are recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item in line with the rules for hedge accounting. Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedged items are measured at Fair Value and recognized in the income statement. Deferred taxes arising from the difference between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base are also recognized directly to equity under a separate equity item if the Fair Value differences were also recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item. The amounts recorded under equity increase or reduce profit or loss as soon as the hedged Cash Flows from the underlying transaction are recognized in the income statement. The Fair Value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to the amount either paid or received by the group company upon termination of the financial instrument on the balance sheet date. The calculation of the Fair Value takes into account the interest rates and forward rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in the Fair Value depends on the application of the derivative financial instrument. Where the derivative financial instrument is not used in an effective hedging relationship, the change in Fair Value is immediately recognized to profit or loss. If, on the other hand, an effective hedging relationship exists, then it is recorded as such. The Beauty Holding Group implements derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments only as part of Cash Flow Hedges. By way of such Cash Flow Hedges, the Beauty Holding Group hedges the exposure to future variability in Cash Flows attributable to risks associated with recognized assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment at store level, as CGUs, led to write-downs totaling 7.0 million EUR in the fiscal year under review. Ongoing negative contributions towards profits and the intended closure of stores triggered the performance of impairment tests on the CGUs. Leaseholds of 0.9 million EUR were also subject to impairment. As part of impairment testing, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as being the value in use of the future Cash Flows based on internal forecasts. Sensitivity planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit forecasts, estimates of replacement investments in the store network, and the ratio of personnel expenses to sales on the basis of individual stores. The forecasts are based on the fixed term of the respective lease agreements. The forecast term is between one and ten years. Calculations are based on interest rates of between 7.3 percent and 18.8 percent before taxes. The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lifes, including goodwill, amounts to a total of 892.2 million EUR. Of this amount, 318.4 million EUR is attributable to goodwill arising from the acquisition. This was allocated to the following operating segments in line with their respective profit capacity: Perfumeries Division: 247.7 million EUR; Jewelry Division: 60.3 million EUR; Confectionery Division: 7.0 million EUR; and Fashion Division: 3.1 million EUR. Of the remaining amount of 574.1 million EUR, most is attributable to the trademarks capitalized in the course of the business combination. These include the following brands: “Douglas” with a carrying amount of 488.2 million EUR, “Christ” with a carrying amount of 56.5 million EUR, “Hussel” with a carrying amount of 8.3 million EUR, as well as “Thalia” with a carrying amount of 7.4 million EUR. As is the case with goodwill, the brands are allocated to the respective operating segments (Perfumeries, Books, Jewelry, Fashion, Confectionery), which each represent brand sales. Furthermore, certain purchased location advantages associated with the leasehold interests were classified as intangible assets with indefinite useful lifes. The useful life of these assets is independent of the term of the rental agreement. Their values are based on the individual usability advantages of each location. A total of 10.9 million EUR is attributable to various locations in France and 2.5 million EUR to one location in Vienna. According to IAS 36, existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lifes are subject to an impairment test at least once each year. As is the case for impairment tests for tangible assets, the carrying amount of the CGUs is compared with the recoverable amount of the CGUs, with the recoverable amount in the Beauty Holding Group being defined as the value in use based on the discounted future Cash Flows from the internal forecast. Sensitivity planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit forecasts, estimates of replacement investments in the store network, and the ratio of personnel expenses to sales. The forecasts are based on both internal company estimates and experience values as well as external macroeconomic data. The forecasts are developed on the basis of actual past values (historical data) and take into account an additional rise in profitability for individual foreign Perfumery companies from the increase in the share of private labels and exclusive brands. The forecasts are based on detailed forecast periods of five years and a subsequent constant perpetual annuity. The calculations are based on a risk-adjusted growth rate of 1.0 percent before adjustments for future market saturation effects depending on the expected ROCE. For discounting purposes, an interest rate is applied of 10.76 percent before taxes. ----- Impairment testing applied to goodwill led to leasehold write-downs in the amount of 0.9 million EUR in the fiscal year under review. In addition to the impairment tests, sensitivity analyses were performed. Regarding goodwill of the individual divisions, impairment needs would always arise if, under the same sensitivity parameters, the following parameters were included in the calculation with at least the following amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

At the same time, the volume is also distributed amongst several contracting parties in order to avoid a concentration of risks. On account of the difficult global economic situation, larger monetary deposits are avoided or only opened with first-rated German banks. Arising from the increased focus of the distribution channel on the Internet, the companies of the Beauty Holding Group are faced with a receivables default risk, which is a system-inherent risk in mail ordering.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a (1) HGB are the responsibility of the parent company’s Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 317 HGB and German Generally Accepted Standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the company’s Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315a (1) HGB, and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The Group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Basis of preparation",1368.182.1,Background and purpose of the Combined Financial Statements,"Al Beauty & Cy S.C.A., Luxembourg, announced its plans to publicly list DOUGLAS Perfumeries Business (hereafter referred to as “DOUGLAS Group” or “DOUGLAS”). According to the European Prospectus Regulation No. 809/2004 (“EPV”), an issuer shall present historical financial information covering the latest three periods in its securities prospectus. Therefore, financial information for the periods from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013 and from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012 are prepared. According to the EPV, DOUGLAS Group has a “Complex Financial History”. Therefore, the Combined Financial Statements consisting of Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income, Combined Statements of Financial Position, Combined Statement of Changes in Equity, Combined Cash Flow Statement, Segment Reporting and Notes to the Combined Financial Statements for the years 2013/14, 2012/13 and 2011/12 (collectively referred to hereafter as “Combined Financial Statements”) were prepared. Formerly DOUGLAS Perfumeries Business was one of the operating segments of the DOUGLAS HOLDING AG. In December 2012 Beauty Holding Two GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beauty Holding One GmbH, which is based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, has acquired all shares in DOUGLAS HOLDING AG via its subsidiary Beauty Holding Three AG a holding company indirectly held by funds advised by Advent International GmbH and the Kreke Family. Beauty Holding Three AG was merged with Beauty Holding Two with retroactive effect as of October 1, 2012. In December 2012 Beauty Holding Three AG took control of the shares in DOUGLAS HOLDING AG within the scope of a voluntary public takeover offer. The takeover offer was subject to the condition precedent that at least 75 percent of the shares in DOUGLAS HOLDING AG would be put on offer. This limit was exceeded on December 4, 2012. The takeover of the remaining shares was concluded following the transfer of the remaining shares to Beauty Holding Two GmbH resolved during the Annual General Meeting held on May 28, 2013. As of today, Beauty Holding Two GmbH holds 100 percent of the shares in DOUGLAS HOLDING AG. DOUGLAS Perfumeries Business was the largest division (operating segment) of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG. DOUGLAS HOLDING AG was a leading European multi-channel retail conglomerate formerly consisting of five independent retail formats – DOUGLAS Perfumeries, Thalia Book stores, Christ Jewelry stores, Hussel Confectionery stores and Appelrath Cüpper Fashion stores (the latter divisions are not part of this Combined Financial Statements and have been sold to Al Beauty & Cy S.C.A as at October 1, 2014 - except for Hussel Confectionery stores which have been sold as of April 30, 2014). DOUGLAS Perfumeries Business holds a leading market position with 1,532 perfumeries in Europe spanning 18 countries offering fragrances, care products, make-up, fashion-accessories and decoration articles to its customers. DOUGLAS Perfumeries Business is operating in the regions Germany, France, South-western Europe and Eastern Europe. On June 24, 2014, DOUGLAS acquired the French perfumery chain Nocibé whereas Nocibé is integrated into DOUGLAS as of July 1, 2014. With this acquisition, DOUGLAS Group further developed its position as a leading perfumery chain in Europe. The acquisition of Nocibé by DOUGLAS Group created the largest perfumery chain in France, with 373 stores and about 2,946 employees. Together, in France, DOUGLAS and Nocibé achieve a number two position in terms of turnover. The DOUGLAS Group is managed centrally by the Management Board of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG, located in Kabeler Str. 4, 58099 Hagen, Germany. The purpose of these Combined Financial Statements is to provide general historical financial in-formation of DOUGLAS Group for the inclusion in the prospectus for the initial public offering and for the admission to the regulated market. Therefore, the Combined Financial Statements present only the historical financial information of those entities that will be part of DOUGLAS Group at the time of the intended initial public offering.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

However, DOUGLAS Corporate Service GmbH (DCS), formerly part of segment Services, is not included in ----- the Combined Financial Statement due to a management buyout. Furthermore, the entities “Intermoda” of the former Fashion segment and “Buch & Medien” of the former Books segment (intermediate holding companies with out any business) have been added to the DOUGLAS Group and subsumed to the services entities. The structure of the DOUGLAS Group is illustrated in the following organizational chart (a detailed list of all entities of the Combined Group can be found under “other explanatory notes”): Thalia, Christ, Appelrath-Cüpper and Hussel are not part of the combined group and hence their business impact is not included in these combined financial statements. In addition, it is to be noted that Hussel has been sold as of April 30, 2014 and that the remaining business units have been sold to Al Beauty & Cy S.C.A as of October 1, 2014. For the years ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, all of the entities of DOUGLAS Group were under common control of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Basis of preparation",1368.182.3,Presentation of the Combined Financial Statements,"The DOUGLAS Group as described above has prepared these Combined Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). These Combined Financial Statements are the first financial statements of DOUGLAS Group as defined in the section “Scope of the entities included in the Combined Financial Statements” in accordance with IFRS 1.3. DOUGLAS Group prepared the Combined Financial Statements using IFRS 1.D16 (a) (“predecessor accounting method”). The DOUGLAS Group used the same accounting policies and valuation methods with the exception of IAS 19R in accordance with IFRS 1 for the preparation of these Combined Financial Statements, as those used by the DOUGLAS companies for the preparation of the financial information included in historical DOUGLAS HOLDING AG Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, accounting policies adopted by DOUGLAS HOLDING AG for the reporting period as of September 30, 2014 subject to the presentation of early payment discount and the presentation of effects from currency translation have been also applied in accordance with IFRS 1 since October, 1 2011. These accounting policies have been disclosed under Note 4 (Accounting and valuation principles). The Combined Financial Statements were prepared on a historical cost basis according to the current accounting policies of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG as included in DOUGLAS HOLDING AG Consolidated Financial Statements, based on DOUGLAS HOLDING AG’s date of transition to IFRS (October 1, 2004). Since IFRS does not provide any guidance for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements, IAS 8.12 has been used for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements. IAS 8.12 requires that the latest pronouncements of other standard setters, other accounting literature and accepted industry practice should be considered. The Combined Financial Statements of the DOUGLAS Group have been derived from the aggregation of the net assets of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All intra-group balances, income, expenses and unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions between companies belonging to DOUGLAS Group ----- were eliminated when preparing the Combined Financial Statements. Investments of the holding companies in DOUGLAS Group were eliminated against the equity of the respective subsidiaries. In addition, investments of DOUGLAS Group in non-IPO entities are eliminated against equity of DOUGLAS Group. Dividend distributions and transfers of profit and loss subject to profit and loss transfer agreements regarding those entities that are not part of the DOUGLAS Group are presented as other changes in equity similar to contributions of capital or withdrawals of capital respectively. In the combined cash flow statement such transactions are presented as proceeds or repayments of equity within cash flow from financing activities. Transactions with Beauty Holding Two GmbH, Beauty Holding One GmbH and Beauty Holding Zero GmbH as well as with the DOUGLAS HOLDING AG group companies, which do not belong to DOUGLAS Group, have been disclosed as transactions with related parties. Income taxes were determined based on the assumption that the companies in DOUGLAS Group were separately taxable entities for the reporting period 2011/12 and 2012/13. This assumption implies that the current and deferred income taxes of all companies and of the tax groups within DOUGLAS Group are calculated separately and the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is also assessed accordingly for the reporting period 2011/12 and 2012/13. In the reporting period 2013/14, the introduction of a new profit and loss transfer agreement for the formation of a new tax group, in which Beauty Holding One GmbH is the tax group parent, caused a structure in which DOUGLAS HOLDING AG becomes an interim tax group entity. The implication of this structure is that the allocation of income and deferred taxes is performed according to the group allocation method. This causes a systematic allocation of income and deferred taxes of the tax group parent to each tax group entity. Due to the fact that certain entities of DOUGLAS Group did not file separate tax returns in previous years, the respective current tax assets and liabilities, as well as the deferred tax assets on net operating losses, are deemed either contributed or distributed to the respective tax group member filing the tax return with a corresponding effect in the equity of the (non-DOUGLAS Group) share-holder as of the end of the respective period. The taxes actually paid by the DOUGLAS Group have been presented in the Combined Statements of cash flow; the deemed contributions or distributions have not been included. In period 2013/14 all companies of DOUGLAS Group were either separately taxable entities or were part of an income tax group within Beauty Holding One Group. Receivables and payables between DOUGLAS HOLDING AG and Beauty Holding Two GmbH, Beauty Holding One GmbH or Beauty Holding Zero GmbH arising from the VAT group have been disclosed under other tax receivables / payables. Management considers the separate tax return approach to be reasonable, but not necessarily indicative of the tax income or expense that would have been incurred if the entities were indeed separate taxable entities. The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared and published in millions of Euro (EUR m). Rounding differences may occur in respect of individual amounts or percentages. The Combined Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Management Board of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG located in Kabeler Str. 4, 58099 Hagen, Germany, on April 17, 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Accounting and valuation principles,1368.189.1,Intangible assets,"According to IFRS 3, Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or if there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Generally, CGUs are determined by stores and online shops, whereas the ceiling for the allocation is the operating segment in conformity with IFRS 8.5. Operating segments ----- of DOUGLAS Group are the segments Germany, France, South-western Europe and Eastern Europe. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. Other intangible assets are carried at cost. Amortization is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lifes, and is generally recognized in profit or loss. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lifes are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a year. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of such an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Investment subsidies received reduce that asset’s cost for which the subsidy was granted. As a rule, borrowing costs are not included when calculating acquisition costs for property, plant and equipment, but are immediately expensed to the income statement, because there are no qualifying assets in the DOUGLAS Group. Since, based on experience, the DOUGLAS Group’s companies do not utilize restoration obligations, these obligations are generally not recognized in the acquisition costs of the leasehold improvements. In the year of purchase, property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis. Where indications of impairment exist, an impairment test is conducted for the corresponding asset. Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognized when removed or further economic benefits are no longer expected from that asset’s use. The gain or loss from the disposal of the asset arises from the difference between its net realizable value and carrying amount.

Material lease arrangements predominantly relate to the leasing of company stores within the DOUGLAS Group. Leases are recognized in the balance sheet according to the requirements of IAS 17. In order to ensure the greatest possible flexibility, the DOUGLAS Group generally aims to conclude rental agreements with a fixed rental period of no more than ten years and single or multiple exercisable options to ex-tend the lease. In classifying lease agreements, consideration is given to the basic lease term and the exercise of any renewal options on the basis of knowledge acquired in the past, which means that these agreements regularly qualify as operating leases as the fixed lease term plus one renewal option does not exceed the significant part of the economic useful life of the rented premises. If, in cases of exception, the economic ownership of leased assets can be allocated to the DOUGLAS Group, the leased assets are classified as finance lease and are capitalized at the inception of the lease and subject to scheduled straight-line depreciation in subsequent periods. At the commencement of the lease, the leased asset is recognized at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. On the other hand, the financial obligations that result from future lease payments are recognized as a liability in the same amount. Depreciation is ----- conducted over the estimated useful life or the shorter lease term.

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Directly attributable transaction costs are included except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, where transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depending on their classification, financial assets are either measured at fair value (securities and financial assets from derivative financial instruments) or amortized cost (trade accounts receivable and other contractual financial receivables). The DOUGLAS Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a trans-action in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset.

Current tax and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Deferred taxes are identified using the liability method based on the requirements of IAS 12. Deferred taxes are thus recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the combined financial statements and the tax base to the extent that these differences will lead to tax refunds or charges in future. Deferred taxes are measured taking into account the tax rates and tax regulations that have been enacted on the balance sheet date or which are expected to be enacted when the differences are reversed. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that there is taxable income expected on the date the difference is reversed against which the difference can be offset. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax the DOUGLAS Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The DOUGLAS Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax periods based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the DOUGLAS Group to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Interest on borrowings is not included in the acquisition costs as inventories are not qualifying assets. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Recognizable risks are taken into account via writedowns based on the age structure of the receivables. A major portion of receivables that is more than 60 days overdue is transferred to a collection agency. Necessary write-downs are in part conducted by using bad debt accounts. Receivables and other assets are generally derecognized when they are settled. Receivables and other financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that they are impaired. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by a debtor, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers, economic conditions that correlate with defaults or the disappearance of an active market for a security.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Provisions are recognized if there is a legal or constructive obligation to third parties arising from past events and the future cash outflow to fulfill this commitment can be reliably estimated. The carrying amount of the provision is based—for individual risks—on the best estimate of the settlement taking into account all recognizable risks, or—for a large population of risks—the amount computed according to the expected value method. Non-current provisions are carried on the balance sheet at their present value as of the balance sheet date. As of September 30, 2014, non-current provisions were discounted using a maturity related interest rate at an average of 2.7 percent (2013: 3.3 percent, 2012: 3.9 percent). The maturity of long-term human resources commitments is based on the date of dismissal of the employee or forecasted cash outflows. The maturity of long-term real estate commitments is based on the duration of the lease contract or the estimated date of an early termination of the lease contract. Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized if a constructive obligation to restructure was formalized by means of the adoption of a detailed restructuring plan and its communication vis-à-vis those affected as of the closing date. Restructuring provisions comprise only obligatory restructuring expenses. Provisions for pensions are accounted for in line with the requirements of IAS 19. Actuarial calculations for provisions for defined benefit plans use the projected unit credit method. As part of this measurement, the pensions and entitlements known on the balance sheet date are taken into account as well as the increases in salaries and pensions to be expected in future. For funded pension plans, the same interest rate chosen to determine interest expenses resulting from the measurement of obligations is also to be used to calculate interest income from plan assets. If changes to these calculation assumptions result in differences between the identified pension obligations and the pension obligations determined as of the balance sheet date, actuarial gains or losses will be incurred. These actuarial gains or losses as well as other actuarial valuation changes are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income. Plan assets designated at fair value and liabilities from pension plans are presented in a net amount. Plan assets are maintained in qualified policies that are pledged to the employee. The interest portion included in the pension expense is presented as interest expense within the financial result. Further obligations similar to pension provisions such as part-time work schemes and termination benefits are also disclosed according to the requirements of IAS 19. ----- When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Income and expense from non-derivative financial liabilities arise from interest income or expense or from currency translation gains or losses. Financial liabilities are recognized at the inception of the contract and are derecognized when the obligation is extinguished or expired (limitation of time).

Derivative financial instruments are neither used nor issued for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value, which correspond to market value, both upon initial and subsequent measurement in accordance with IAS 39 and can result in a positive or negative figure. Gains and losses from fair value measurement, to the extent that these are designated derivative financial instruments qualifying as hedged items to hedge against cash flow risks, are recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item in line with the rules for hedge accounting. Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedged items are measured at fair value and recognized in the income statement. Deferred taxes arising from the difference between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base are also recognized directly to equity under a separate equity item if the fair value differences were also recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item. The amounts recorded under equity increase or reduce profit or loss as soon as the hedged cash flows from the underlying transaction are recognized in the income statement. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to the amount either paid or received by the DOUGLAS Group company upon termination of the financial instrument on the balance sheet date. The calculation of the fair value takes into account the interest rates and forward rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. The recording of changes in the fair value depends on the application of the derivative financial instrument. Where the derivative financial instrument is not used in an effective hedging relationship, the change in fair value is immediately recognized to profit or loss. If, on the other hand, an effective hedging relationship exists, then it is recorded as such. The DOUGLAS Group implements derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments only as part of cash flow hedges. By way of such cash flow hedges, the DOUGLAS Group hedges the exposure to future variability in cash flows attributable to interest rate risks. In the case of a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the value change in the hedging instruments is recognized directly to equity until the result arising from the hedged items is recognized. In addition, non-derivative financial liabilities as part of a net investment hedge are implemented to cover currency rate risks arising from net investments in non-Group foreign currencies. Accounting for net investment hedges generally follows the rules of cash flow hedges. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Trade tax rates are determined based on the rate of assessment of the municipalities in which the respective companies generate their revenue. For the DOUGLAS Group companies based in Germany, the applicable trade tax rates are between 7 percent and 16 percent, which results in a total tax rate of between 23 percent and 32 percent. Including trade tax and the solidarity surcharge, this resulted in a total tax rate of 32.0 percent. Deferred taxes for the German DOUGLAS Group companies were also generally measured at 32.0 percent. For foreign companies, a country-specific average tax rate is generally applied. Deferred taxes are measured based on the respective specific corporate tax rate. Deferred tax income in the amount of 0.7 million EUR (2012/13: 0.6 million EUR, 2011/12: 1.0 million EUR) were recognized in the reserve for pension provisions as well as deferred tax income of 1.3 million EUR (2012/13: 0.3 million EUR, 2011/12: 0.0 million EUR) in the Cash Flow hedge. For tax losses carried forward of particular DOUGLAS Group companies totaling 53.8 million EUR (2012/13: 57.7 million EUR, 2011/12: 43.5 million EUR) no deferred tax assets were recognized. Tax losses carried forward of 0.9 million EUR in total (2012/13: 0.4 million EUR, 2011/12: 0.0 million EUR) were utilized in the reporting period. The applicable tax rate recognized for the purposes of tax reconciliation has been calculated on the basis of the average effective corporate tax rates of the respective DOUGLAS Group companies. The applicable average tax rate used in the fiscal year 2013/14 amounted to 19.2 percent (2012/13: 26.8 percent, 2011/12: 25.6 percent).

Capital expenditure in property, plant and equipment primarily relates to the opening and acquisition of five new stores in Germany (2012/13: 3 stores, 2011/12: 8 stores) and 25 stores abroad (2012/13: 18 stores, 2011/12: 30 stores). In addition, investments were made to design and re-design existing stores. Scheduled amortization/depreciation for the period totaled 62.5 million EUR (2012/13: 63.4 million EUR, 2011/12: 69.4 million EUR). Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment were conducted at store level (as the stores represent CGUs) and led to impairment losses totaling 1.8 million EUR (2012/13: 4.8 million EUR, 2011/12: 13.8 million EUR) in the reporting period. The impairment tests were triggered by ongoing negative contribution margins and intended closure of stores. In the reporting period 2013/14 no leaseholds were subject to impairment (2012/13: 0.8 million EUR, 2011/12: 1.3 million EUR). Moreover, write-ups amounted to 0.6 million EUR in period 2013/14 (2012/13: 0.0 million EUR, 2011/12: 1.0 million EUR) and are presented as other operating income. In general, single cash-generating units are written-up due to increases in income following a previous write-down. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Sensitive assumptions used for the calculation of the recoverable amount include in particular sales growth, gross profit forecasts, estimated replacement investments in the store network and the ratio of personnel expenses to sales on the basis of individual stores. The forecasts are based on the fixed term of the respective lease agreements. The forecast term is between one and ten years. Calculations are based on interest rates of between 7.5 percent and 16.7 percent before taxes. As of the balance sheet date, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the amount of 798.0 million EUR (2012/13: 172.9 million EUR, 2011/12: 0.0 million EUR) were pledged to a banking syndicate as collateral for bank loans.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Those are: Germany, France, South-western Europe and Eastern Europe. The goodwill impairment test is thus also executed on the level of the operating segments. According to IAS 36, existing goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once each year. Like impairment tests for tangible assets, the carrying amount of the CGUs is compared to its recoverable amount whereas the recoverable amount in the DOUGLAS Group is defined as the value in use based on the discounted future cash flows according to management´s business plan. Sensitivity planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit expectations, estimations concerning in-vestments in store network and EBITDA margin. The forecasts are based on both internal management estimates and experience values as well as external macroeconomic data. The forecasts are developed on the basis of actual historic values and take into account an additional rise in profitability for perfumery companies of different regions. The forecasts are based on detailed forecast periods of four years and a subsequent constant perpetual annuity. They are based on a net sales growth rate of operating segments of 2.0 percent p.a. and a slight increase of profitability. The projected growth in net sales is expected to relate mainly to the e-commerce division which saw above average growth rates in the past years. The profitability growth rate is expected to range between 0.0 percent and 0.7 percent based on the operating segment for the medium-term and is based on synergy effects. The calculations are based on a risk-adjusted growth rate of 1.0 percent. For discounting purposes, an interest rate of 7.49 percent has been used for segment Germany, France and South-western Europe, whereas a interest rate of 7.99 percent has been used for segment Eastern Europe since segment Eastern Europe is exposed to a higher market risk. Pre-tax interest rates amount to 11.0 percent for Germany, France and South-western Europe and 11.75 percent for Eastern Europe. The book values of goodwill of the segments amount to 16.6 million EUR in Germany, 287.6 million EUR in France including the goodwill related to Nocibé, 0.8 million EUR in South-western Europe and 6.5 million EUR in Eastern Europe. Impairment testing applied to goodwill, led to no write-downs in the reporting period. ----- In addition to the impairment tests, sensitivity analyses were performed.

The brand Nocibé will be pursued in France and stores that have previously been operated under the brand “Douglas” were flagged under the brand Nocibé. Through the acquisition the market share in France was raised significantly. The purchase price amounted to 165.2 million EUR and was fully paid in cash. In the course of the purchase price allocation the brand Nocibé was measured at 139.6 million EUR and recognized in the consolidation balance sheet. Moreover, the customer base and beneficial tenancy agreements were recognized within intangible assets at the amount of 17.5 million EUR and 1.6 million EUR respectively. Furthermore, the purchase price allocation resulted in an additional fair value step up of inventory stock at the amount of 32.4 million EUR.

The operative business segments are combined into reporting segments in the segment re-porting, which correspond to the regional corporate divisions of DOUGLAS Group. Service and regional holding entities are allocated to the segment based on the region of their place of business. Key financial figures of the operating segments are reported regularly to the managing board member of DOUGLAS, the chief operating decision maker, who decides on that basis and allocates re-sources accordingly. ----- The earnings of the operative business segments are determined in compliance with the accounting and valuation methods applied to the Combined Financial Statements. Transfers between segments are at the same prices that would apply between third parties (arm’s length transactions). _Germany_ DOUGLAS has 434 perfumeries in Germany (2012/13: 438 perfumeries, 2011/12: 446 perfumeries). Segment Germany also includes services entities located in Germany, which are responsible for business activities with non-IPO entities. _France_ DOUGLAS has 93 perfumeries in France (2012/13: 92 perfumeries, 2011/12: 93 perfumeries). Furthermore, 373 perfumeries have been included into segment France due to the Nocibé acquisition. _South-western Europe_ DOUGLAS has 360 perfumeries in South-western Europe (2012/13: 363 perfumeries, 2011/12: 377 perfumeries). _Eastern Europe_ DOUGLAS has 272 perfumeries in Eastern Europe (2012/13: 264 perfumeries, 2011/12: 274 perfumeries).",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The utilization as of the reporting date was 0.0 million EUR. In addition, some entities hold bilateral current account facilities with a total utilization of 8.6 million EUR. DOUGLAS Group has to meet certain obligations and key financial covenants, an interest cover (EBITDA in relation to financing expenses), a leverage cover (relation of net debt to adjusted EBITDA), a cash flow cover (cash flow in relation to debt servicing), and a capex cover (ceiling for investments). If these obligations are not met, the lenders are entitled to cancel the loan agreements with immediate effect and call upon all pledged collateral. The financial covenants are calculated on a quarterly basis and tested annually. All agreed financial covenants were adhered to in the fiscal year 2013/14. A compliance certificate was issued to the lenders in connection with this. The Executive Board of DOUGLAS HOLDING AG estimates that the risk of any financial covenants not being adhered to in the fiscal year 2014/15 is low. All of the German subsidiaries of the DOUGLAS Group and some subsidiaries based abroad are linked to a cash management system (cash pooling). By combining financing volumes, short-term liquidity surpluses of individual DOUGLAS Group companies can be used to finance the cash requirements of other DOUGLAS Group companies. This leads to a reduction in borrowing and an optimization of cash investments, thus having a positive impact on the DOUGLAS Group’s net interest result. ----- The following tables show financial liabilities and the corresponding future payments due:",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

The mezzanine financing is also subject to the risk of variable cash flow fluctuations. The variable interest on this financing is based on the six-month EURIBOR. Two third of the nominal amounts of these loans were hedged against interest rate risks to reduce the risk posed by cash flow fluctuations as a result of changes in the interest rates for these variably financed loans. For this purpose, three interest rate swaps with nominal amounts totaling 567.0 million EUR were concluded at the level DOUGLAS HOLDING AG.

Financial instruments measured at cost are not subject to any interest rate risks. Interests of financial instruments with variable interest rates are subject to interest rate risks if they were not designated as the underlying transaction in a cash flow hedge.

The corresponding interest rate risk in the prior year was 2.7 million EUR. If the EURIBOR were to fall to 0.0 percent, interest expense would decrease by 1.2 million EUR. Of this amount, 0.6 million EUR was attributable to the loan taken out in the prior fiscal year in the amount of 275.0 million EUR.

The consolidated financial statements of Nocibé Group, have been prepared in the context of securities offering of Douglas Perfumeries. Douglas International GmbH holds all the shares in AI perfume France as Douglas International GmbH is the Douglas Group holding company for all foreign companies and holds also direct investment in existing French Douglas entities. The consolidated financial statements of the Nocibé Group (“the Group”), which is located at Villeneuve d’Ascq, France, and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2014 have been prepared according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, taking into account all mandatory standards and interpretations in effect at the closing date and as adopted in the European Union. Its activities encompass retail store-based and online sales. In accordance with European regulation No. 1606/2002 dated July 19, 2002, the 2014 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted in the European Union. These consolidated financial statements represent the first annual financial statements of the company prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The company adopted IFRS in accordance with IFRS 1, “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” (“IFRS 1”). For the reported periods, the accounting standards and interpretations adopted in the European Union are similar to the 4 compulsory standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with the exception of the carve-out of IAS 39 together with the standards and interpretations currently being endorsed, that have no effect on the Group accounts. Consequently, the Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with the IFRS standards and interpretations, as published by the IASB. These financial statements were authorized for issuance by the President of Groupe Nocibé SAS on March 26, 2015. All figures are shown in thousands of euros (K€). The consolidated financial statements of Nocibé Group presented herein are as of and for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 and as of for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, fiscal year closing of Douglas Group being September 30.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

New IASB accounting standards and IFRS transition,1368.354.1,"New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted","A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1st 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below: IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured ----- at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15. IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 ‘Provisions’. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognized. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRIC 21. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

New IASB accounting standards and IFRS transition,1368.354.2,Transition IFRS,"The European Union has decided to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Under EC regulation 1606/2002 of July 19, 2002, companies listed on a regulated stock exchange in one of the member states are required to present their consolidated financial statements for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2005 in conformity with IFRS. Nocibé Group was not subject to this requirement. The Group has not previously prepared financial or financial information using the basis of preparation presented herein. Prior to the Group’s first-time adoption of IFRS, it prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in France (“French GAAP”) for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. Comparative figures for the year ending December 31, 2013 and for the year ending December 31, 2012: Nocibé Group prepared an opening balance sheet as at January 1, 2012, which is the starting point for the application of IFRS. The quantitative impacts of the transition to IFRS as at January 1, 2012 were recorded in equity in line with IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards”. The main options considered by the Nocibé Group in applying IFRS 1 are: - Fixed assets are evaluated at cost; - Business combinations prior to the transition are not accounted for according to IFRS 3; - Derivatives qualified as hedging instruments in the statutory consolidated accounts and eligible to hedge accounting according to IAS 39 have been qualified as hedging instruments at the transition date.

The financial statements are established based on the following principles: _(a) Subsidiaries_ Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquire is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is ----- recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to comply with the Group’s accounting policies. _(b) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control_ Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. _(c) Disposal of subsidiaries_ When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re-evaluated to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Financial assets are carried at cost less impairment only by exception, if and only if it is an investment in equity securities that is not quoted in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured. The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or Group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that ----- occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Receivables are impaired if there is a non-recovery risk. The amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

Tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognized on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. The carrying amount of the provision is based – for individual risks – on the best estimate of the settlement taking into account all recognizable risks, or – for a large population of risks – the amount computed according to the expected value method. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.

The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. In France, all contributions made to Social Security and other organisms are accounted for as defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognized in the income statement in employee benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation. This cost is included in financial result in the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments are neither used nor issued for speculative purposes. Hedging transactions presented in the notes to the financial statements are solely Cash Flow Hedge operations. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at Fair Value, which correspond to market value, both upon initial and subsequent measurement in accordance with IAS 39; and can result in a positive or negative figure. Gains and losses from Fair Value measurement depends on the application of hedging accounting. Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedging instrument according to IAS 39 requirements are measured at Fair Value and recognized in the income statement. If, on the other hand, derivative instruments are qualified as hedging instruments according to IAS 39, the effective portion of the value changes in hedging derivatives is recognized directly as other comprehensive income under a separate equity item until the result arising from the hedged items is recognized. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognized in the income statement within the financial result. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within Financial Result. ----- Deferred taxes arising from the difference between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base are also recognized directly as other comprehensive income under a separate equity item if the Fair Value differences were also recognized directly as other comprehensive income under a separate equity item.

The Group bases its estimate of return on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement. As a rule, sales are only recognized after goods are delivered and/or the service has been provided. The risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer on delivery of the goods.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. _(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill_ The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 5, Intangible assets. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 12). _(b) Income taxes_ Significant judgment is required in determining provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. _(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments_ The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example Over-the-counter derivatives, shareholder loan) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period (note 23). _(d) Pension benefits_ The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms ----- of the related pension obligation.

As is the case for impairment tests for tangible assets, the carrying amount of the CGUs is compared with the recoverable amount of the CGUs, with the recoverable amount in the NOCIBE Group being defined as the value in use based on the discounted future Cash Flows from the internal forecast. Sensitivity planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit forecasts, and estimates of replacement investments in the store network and the ratio of personnel expenses to sales. The forecasts are based on both internal company estimates and experience values as well as external macroeconomic data. The Nocibé Group has been built from various acquisitions. However the Group does not monitor existing goodwill at the store level. The stores are indeed not independent from each other as their operating performance is largely affected by strategic decisions managed centrally: - Sale prices are decided at the Group level and are the same for all stores. - Assortments to be displayed in stores are defined, along with marketing strategy and operations, at the Group level. - Recruitment and incentives for store staff are managed centrally. - All negotiations with suppliers including rebates and bonuses are managed centrally. This is why the Group is considered as the one and only Cash Generating Unit for impairment testing purpose. The value in use is then derived from an estimated projection of the Group future operating performance. The internal forecast is built on the basis of actual past values (historical data) and takes into account expected profitability improvement.",N/A,as_expected,2015,694

Following a decision of the Court of Appeal (Cour d’appel) of Paris dated 26 January 2012, the fine was reduced to 3 150 K€. The fine has been paid by the Nocibé Group and consequently the provision has been reduced to EUR 1 850K€ at the end of 2012. On 11 June 2013, the French Cour de cassation overruled the decision of the Court of Appeal and referred the case back regarding the fine imposed on Nocibé and upheld this decision concerning all other parties involved in this matter. As a result, the provision was increased to reach 5 400K€ (the 3 150K€ payment being booked as product to be received, see note 14). The Court of Appeal of Paris upheld the EUR 3 150K€ fine in a decision dated 10 April 2014. On 9 May 2014, Nocibé France lodged an appeal against this decision before the Cour de cassation.

Since the acquisition is expected to have a material impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of BHZ, the following pro forma consolidated income statement was prepared for the period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014. The presentation of the pro forma consolidated income statement is based on certain pro forma assumptions and is intended for illustrative purposes only. The pro forma consolidated income statement assumes that the acquisition of Nocibé Group had taken place on October 1, 2013. Therefore, the pro forma consolidated income statement describes only a hypothetical situation and thus, due to its nature, the presentation does not reflect the actual results of net assets, financial position and results of operations ----- of BHZ after completion of the acquisition. In addition, the pro forma consolidated income statement does not represent a forecast of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of BHZ at a future time.

We have audited whether the pro forma financial information for the period from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014 of Beauty Holding Zero GmbH, Düsseldorf, has been properly compiled on the basis stated in the pro forma notes and whether this basis is consistent with the accounting policies of the Company. The pro forma financial information comprises a pro forma income Statement for the period from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014, as well as pro forma notes. The purpose of the pro forma financial information is to present the material effects the transaction described in the pro forma notes would have had on the historical financial Statements if the group had existed in the structure created by the transaction throughout the entire reporting period. As pro forma financial information reflects a hypothetical situation it is not entirely consistent with the presentation that would have resulted had the relevant events actually occurred at the beginning of the reporting period. The compilation of pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion, based on our audit, whether the pro forma financial information has been properly compiled on the basis stated in the pro forma notes and whether this basis is consistent with the accounting policies of the Company. The subject matter of this engagement does neither include an audit of the basic figures including their adjustment to the accounting policies of the company, nor of the pro forma assumptions stated in the pro forma notes. We have planned and performed our audit in accordance with the IDW Auditing Practice Statement: Audit of Pro Forma Financial Information (IDWAuPS 9.960.1) promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V. (IDW) in such a way that material errors in the compilation of the pro forma financial information on the basis stated in the pro forma notes and in the compilation of this basis consistent with the accounting policies of the Company are detected with reasonable assurance. In our opinion, the pro forma financial information has been properly compiled on the basis stated in the pro forma notes. This basis is consistent with the accounting policies of the Company.
