Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Article 4(1) of MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (for the purposes of this provision, a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term “manufacturers” shall mean such
of the Joint Bookrunners and Co-Managers as are subject to the product governance rules under MiFID II.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is
only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”) and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities
(for the purposes of this provision, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term “manufacturers” shall mean such
of the Joint Bookrunners and Co-Managers as are subject to the product governance rules under COBS and
UK MiFIR.

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of


-----

MiFID II; or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

##### Douglas GmbH
**€1,305,000,000 6.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2026**
##### Kirk Beauty SUN GmbH
**€475,000,000 8.250% / 9.000% Senior PIK Notes due 2026**

Douglas GmbH (the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) is offering €1,305,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.000% Senior Secured Notes due
2026 (the “Senior Secured Notes”), and Kirk Beauty SUN GmbH (the “Senior PIK Notes Issuer”, together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the “Issuers”),
is offering (together with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the “Offering”) €475,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its €8.250%/9.000% Senior
PIK Notes due 2026 (the “Senior PIK Notes”, together with the Senior Secured Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on each April 15 and October 15, commencing October 15, 2021, except for the final interest payments on their respective Maturity Dates. The
Senior PIK Notes Indenture (as defined herein) will provide that interest is payable on the Senior PIK Notes, at the election of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer,
(1) entirely in cash (“Cash Interest”) or (ii) by increasing the principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes or by issuing Senior PIK Notes in a principal amount
equal to such interest (in each case “PIK Interest”). The gross proceeds from the Offering, together with proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan B
Facility under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the Equity Contribution will be used to (1) fund the redemption of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and Existing Senior Notes; (2) repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities (including amounts outstanding under the
existing revolving credit facility); (3) fund cash on hand and (4) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed prior to April 15, 2023 at redemption prices equal to 100% of the principal amount of the relevant
Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and additional amounts, if any, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as
described in this offering memorandum. The Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after April 15, 2023, at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum. At any time prior to April 15, 2023, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at a
redemption price equal to 106.000% provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior Secured Notes
(excluding any Additional Senior Secured Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption, and at any time prior to April 15, 2023, up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 108.250%, provided that at least 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior PIK Notes (excluding any Additional Senior PIK Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption, in
each case, with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings. At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2023, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may, during each calendar year, redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to
103.000% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) and accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. All of the relevant series of Notes may also be redeemed upon
the occurrence of certain developments affecting taxation. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the relevant series of Notes, if holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of such outstanding Notes of the relevant series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the relevant Issuer, as the case may be, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of such Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, such Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem, in whole or in part, such Notes that remain
outstanding, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to other holders of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon
(but excluding any early tender or incentive fee). Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the relevant Issuer may be required to
make an offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but not
including) the date of repurchase, provided that on an one-time basis no change of control will be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net
leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.
The Senior Secured Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and as of the Issue Date will be guaranteed on a senior
basis by the Issue Date Guarantors (as defined herein). On or prior to a date falling (a) on the later of the date on which such Post-Closing Guarantor
provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which such Post-Closing Guarantor
provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the Senior Secured Notes will be additionally
guaranteed on a senior basis by the Post-Closing Guarantors (together with the Issue Date Guarantors, the “Guarantors”) that will also guarantee the Senior
Secured Facilities other than subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated in France and Italy, which will only guarantee the Senior Secured
Facilities. The Senior PIK Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and as of the Issue Date will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated
basis by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantors. On or prior to a date falling (a) on the later of the date on which such Post-Closing
Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which such Post-Closing
Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the Senior PIK Notes will be additionally
guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Post-Closing Guarantors. The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will require that on or prior to November 30,
2021 and provided the Post-Closing Reorganization has not been completed, the direct parent company of TopCo as of such date will become a party to
the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and guarantee the Senior PIK Notes on a senior basis, and the Senior PIK Notes will be secured by a first-priority security
interest over the shares of, and receivables owed by, such direct parent company of TopCo. See “Description of the Senior PIK Notes”.
On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date Collateral (as defined
herein). On or prior to a date falling (a) on the later of the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Notes Post-Closing Collateral (as defined herein) secures
the Senior Secured Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Notes Post-Closing
Collateral secures the Senior Secured Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the Senior Secured Notes will be additionally secured by a firstpriority security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Post-Closing Collateral (together with the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date Collateral, the “Senior Secured
Notes Collateral”) granted by the shareholders of Kirk Beauty Two GmbH (“TopCo”), TopCo and certain of the TopCo’s subsidiaries that will also secure the
Senior Secured Facilities, other than security provided by certain subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated in France and Italy, which will
only secure the Senior Secured Facilities. On the Issue Date, the Senior PIK Notes will be secured by the Senior PIK Notes Issue Date Collateral (as defined
herein) on a first-priority basis and the Shared Collateral (as defined herein) on a second-priority basis. Collateral, priority and ranking of the Note Guarantees
and the liability of the Guarantors are subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure—Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”._
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for
the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the
Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.
Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 45.

person making the offer is not qualified to do so, or to any person who cannot legally be offered the securities. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about April 8,
2021, which will be 9 business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, (the “U.S. Exchange Act”)) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle
is being referred to as “T + 9”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or
the following 9 business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their
own advisors.

###### STABILIZATION

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, GOLDMAN SACHS BANK EUROPE SE (THE “STABILIZING
MANAGER”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) MAY OVER-ALLOT
NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES AT
A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE
THAT THE STABILIZING MANAGER (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF A STABILIZING MANAGER) WILL
UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE
ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE FINAL TERMS OF THE OFFER OF THE NOTES IS
MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY BE ENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN THE EARLIER
OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE OF THE NOTES AND 60 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ALLOTMENT
OF THE NOTES.

Notice to U.S. Investors

The Notes will be sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S of the
Securities Act and within the United States to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A. The Notes and the Note Guarantees
have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes may not be offered or sold
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Notes shall not be
offered, sold or delivered (i) as part of an Initial Purchaser’s distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until
40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the latest closing date, within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except pursuant to Rule 144A and each dealer to
which Notes have been sold during the distribution compliance period will be sent a confirmation or other
notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. See “Notice to Investors.”

Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes under
the UK Prospectus Regulation. The expression “UK Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129,
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (“EUWA”).

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Professional Investors and ECPs only target market. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s
product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that:
(i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of
Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms

assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term
“manufacturers” shall mean such of the Joint Bookrunners and Co-Managers as are subject to the product
governance rules under COBS and UK MiFIR.

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who: (i) are outside the UK; (ii) have
professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”); (iii)
are persons falling within Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”)
of the Financial Promotion Order; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in
connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum
is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant
persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person
should not act or rely on this offering memorandum or any of its contents.

Notice to Investors in the European Economic Area

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended or superseded).

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

Professional Investors and ECPs only target market. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s
product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led the manufacturers to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only,
each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (for
the purposes of this provision, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term
“manufacturers” shall mean such of the Joint Bookrunners and Co-Managers as are subject to the product
governance rules under MiFID II.

###### INDUSTRY AND MARKET INFORMATION

We operate in an industry in which it is difficult to obtain precise industry or market information. We
have generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this offering memorandum from industry
publications and from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources, including a report commissioned
by our Group prepared by OC&C Strategy Consultants (“OC&C”) entitled “European Beauty Market Review”
(December 2019) (the “OC&C Market Review”) and a corresponding update entitled “European Beauty Market
Review – 2019 Market Update, Covid Impact & Outlook” (March 2021) (the “OC&C Market Review Update”).

We believe that these industry publications, surveys and studies are reliable. However, we cannot
assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information. While we have accurately reproduced such
third-party information, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have verified the accuracy of such information,
market data or other information on which third parties have based their studies. As far as we are aware and
are able to ascertain from information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted that would
render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Market studies are frequently based on
information and assumptions that may not be exact or appropriate, and their methodology is by nature
forward-looking and speculative.

This offering memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived therefrom
that cannot be gathered from publications by market research institutions or any other independent sources.
Such statements in this offering memorandum regarding our industry and our position in the industry have
been made based on our experience and our own investigation of market conditions. We cannot assure you
that any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry, and none of our
internal surveys or information have been verified by any independent sources. We believe that our estimates
of market data and information derived therefrom are helpful to give investors a better understanding of the
industry in which we operate as well as our position within the industry. Although we believe that our internal
market observations are reliable, our own estimates are not reviewed or verified by any external sources. While
we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data
involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed
under the heading “Risk Factors.”

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Financial Information

The historical financial information included and presented in this offering memorandum is that of the
Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries. TopCo is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of
its own and does not have any business operations, material assets (other than the shares it owns in its
subsidiaries and intragroup receivables) or liabilities (other than intragroup liabilities that will be extinguished
following completion of the Post-Closing Mergers). The Senior PIK Notes Issuer is a newly-incorporated
company formed for the purposes of the Transaction and is not expected to engage in any activities other than
those related to its formation, the Transaction and the Post-Closing Reorganization. The Senior PIK Notes
Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities are currently and are expected to be in the future its interest in the
issued and outstanding shares of any subsidiary and its outstanding indebtedness and intercompany balances
incurred in connection with the Transaction and the Post-Closing Reorganization. Consequently, no financial
information with respect to Topco or the Senior PIK Notes Issuer is included in this offering memorandum. In
particular, this offering memorandum includes and presents:

    - the consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the financial year ended
September 30, 2019 (the “financial year 2018/2019”), including the comparative financial
information as of and for the financial year ended September 30, 2018 (the “financial year
2017/2018”), which have been audited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,
Barbarossaplatz 1a, 50674 Cologne (“KPMG”);

    - the consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the financial year ended
September 30, 2020 (the “financial year 2019/2020”), including the comparative financial
information as of and for the financial year 2018/2019, which have been audited by KPMG (the
disclosure note referring to the disaggregation of revenue according to IFRS 15.114 et. seq.
attributable to e-commerce and brick & mortar sales on a segment level (which we present based
on geographical regions) for the financial year 2019/2020 was not included in our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the financial year 2019/2020 and is presented now according to
IAS 8.42 et seq. in the unaudited IFRS interim consolidated financial information as of and for the
three months period ended December 31, 2020 (see the note “net sales” to our unaudited IFRS
interim consolidated financial information as of and for the three months period ended
December 31, 2020)); and

    - the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the
three months ended December 31, 2020 (the “first quarter 2020/2021”), including the
comparative financial information as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2019 (the
“first quarter 2019/2020”) (the unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for
the first quarter 2019/2020 has been restated according to IAS 8.42 et. sec. during the financial
year 2020/2021 due to overstated accrued expenses in the reportable segment Germany,
incomplete IFRS 16 lease contract data, and the re-assessment of the expected useful life of a
building, which was understated and such restatement was included in the unaudited interim
consolidated financial information as of and for the first quarter 2020/2021 and disclosed in the
notes thereto). In addition thereto, note that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2020,
authorized for issue as of February 25, 2021, have been replaced by the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent, authorized for issue as of March 12,
2021.

The audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 are
together referred to as the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2020 are referred to as the
“Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements” (together with the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The current financial year, which will end on
September 30, 2021, is referred to as “financial year 2020/2021”. The audit reports, included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the respective periods and the audit report
in relation to the financial year 2019/2020 includes a material uncertainty paragraph related to going concern
as set forth in Note 2 to such financial statements. In addition, the notes to the unaudited interim consolidated
financial information as of and for the first quarter 2020/2021 also include a note regarding certain financial
risks that represent a going concern risk for the Group. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Paragraph on
_Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern in Audit Report.”_

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
(‘‘IFRS’’). The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum have

###### xiv


-----

been prepared in accordance with international accounting standard 34 “Interim financial reporting” (IAS 34) as
adopted by the European Union. Historical financial data in this offering memorandum denoted as “audited”
was taken from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial data in this offering memorandum
denoted as “unaudited” was not taken from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements but was taken from
the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, our accounting or controlling records, or is based on
calculations of these figures.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum was not prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant
differences between IFRS, as applied by us, and U.S. GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS
and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile our Consolidated Financial Statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such
information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision.

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in the F-pages to this offering memorandum should be read in conjunction with the
relevant notes thereto. Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an
understanding of (i) the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and other systems of generally accepted
accounting principles and how those differences might affect the financial information included in this offering
memorandum and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, IFRS may have on our results of
operations or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods.

In this offering memorandum, references to “brick & mortar sales” refer to the line item “store sales” as
presented in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the line item “net sales stores” in our
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering
memorandum differs from “Adjusted EBITDA” reported in our historical consolidated financial statements,
which is labelled as “Adjusted EBITDA (as reported)” within this offering memorandum.

Certain Changes in Accounting Standards and Accounting Policies

On January 13, 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) published IFRS 16 and
the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on October 31, 2017. IFRS 16 replaces the requirements of IAS 17
(Leases) and abolishes the classification of leases into operating leases and finance leases for lessees, replacing
it with a uniform accounting model where leases are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding lease liability. The right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease and the majority of rental expense previously presented under IAS 17 as “other operating expense” is
now recognized as depreciation of the right-of-use asset. Furthermore, interest expense results from the
ongoing accrual of interest on the lease liability.

We adopted IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective method. As a result, the
audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2017/2018 and the audited consolidated
financial statements for the financial year 2018/2019 have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 and
thus are not directly comparable with our audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year
2019/2020. Given the size of our portfolio of leased stores, we had a significant number of leases formerly
classified as operating leases under IAS 17. As a result, the adoption of IFRS 16 impacted our audited
consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020 by €1,230.9 million recognized as right of
use assets and €1,331.8 million recognized as lease liabilities. For more information, see notes 2, 13 and 25 of
our audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020.

Other Financial Measures

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the
financial statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-IFRS financial measures used in this offering
memorandum include capital expenditures, net working capital, cash conversion, free cash flow, like-for-like
sales growth, like-for-like sales growth (brick & mortar), like-for-like sales growth (e-commerce), EBITDA
(=reported EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA for LTM
December 2019, Management Adjusted EBITDA and certain leverage and coverage ratios (our “Non-IFRS
Measures”). These non-IFRS Measures are not audited and constitute alternative performance measures under
the European Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures. Each of the
EBITDA-based measures presented in this offering memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the
definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indentures.

###### xv


-----

Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows:

- “capital expenditures” is defined as the sum of additions made to intangible assets (primarily
relating to acquired and internally generated software) and property, plant and equipment
(mainly regarding the opening and acquisition of new stores and investments in the design and
re-design of existing stores);

- “cash conversion” is defined as the difference of Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures
divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

- “free cash flow” is defined as the sum of net cash flow from operating activities and net cash flow
from investing activities;

- “like-for-like sales growth” (in %) is defined as sales growth from like-for-like brick & mortar and
from e-Commerce, calculated for the period indicated and shown as a percentage change from
the corresponding previous period:

- “like-for-like sales growth (brick & mortar)” (in %) consists of sales growth from like-for-like stores.
A store is defined as like-for-like per each financial year when it has been open for at least one
entire financial year as of the first day of the relevant period (excluding any temporary closures for
COVID-19 related reasons), and is expected to be open for the full financial year. When
comparing periods other than a financial year, e.g. the first quarters of the financial years
2018/2019 and 2019/2020, a store is defined as like-for-like if the store has been open in both
first quarters and for at least one entire financial year (i.e. financial year 2018/2019, excluding any
temporary closures for COVID-19 related reasons) and is expected to be open for the full financial
year (i.e. financial year 2019/2020). One exception for the definition has been applied to the
calculation of like-for-like sales from financial year 2017/2018 to financial year 2018/2019: In
November 2017, we acquired Limoni S.p.A. (“Limoni”) and La Gardenia Beauty S.p.A. (“La
Gardenia”). The acquired stores would not qualify as like-for-like since they only contributed 11
months instead of a full fiscal year and were moreover affected by numerous closings in financial
year 2017/2018 and financial year 2018/2019. However, due to the size of the acquisition
compared to the gap between 11 months and full fiscal year, we included the Italian acquisition in
the like-for-like total for the financial year 2018/2019. As a result, like-for-like growth for financial
year 2018/2019 on a Group total level has been reduced from 2.6% to 1.9% (brick & mortar from
0.4% to 0.2%). In the financial year 2017/2018, our brick & mortar sales included click & collect
sales in France in the amount of €15.6 million. These click & collect sales were classified as
e-commerce sales in subsequent periods;

- “like-for-like sales growth (e-commerce)” (in %) reflects our organic e-commerce sales growth,
calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding
previous period. In the financial year 2017/2018, our e-commerce sales did not include click &
collect sales in France in the amount of €15.6 million, which were instead classified as brick &
mortar sales. Such click & collect sales were classified as e-commerce sales in subsequent
periods;

- “net working capital” is defined as the sum of the sub-line items (i) inventories, (ii) trade accounts
receivable, (iii) trade accounts payable, and (iv) other receivable and liabilities related to supplier
receivables for rebates/bonuses and marketing subsidies as well as outstanding voucher
liabilities;

- “EBITDA (= reported EBITDA)” is defined as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and
supplies and merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other
operating expenses and plus the result from impairments on financial assets;

- “Adjusted EBITDA (as reported)” is defined as EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) adjusted for those
lease expenses and income in accordance with IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance
with IFRS 16, and adjusted for those items which, in the opinion and decision of the management
of the Parent, are non-regularly recurring, exceptional or unsuitable for internal control, such as
credit card fees, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and severance payments,
consulting fees and other adjustments;

- “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) adjusted for the reversal of credit
card fees and bad debt from the ordinary course of our operational business (write-downs in
connection with receivables from our customers). Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering
memorandum differs from “Adjusted EBITDA” reported in our historical consolidated financial
statements;

###### xvi


-----

    - “Further Adjusted EBITDA for LTM December 2019 is defined as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted
further for the over or under accrual of supplier bonuses, loyalty card provisions, personnel
bonuses and the re-phasing of certain adjustments related to COVID-19 and is the basis for our
Management Adjusted EBITDA; and

    - “Management Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Further Adjusted EBITDA for LTM December 2019
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 adjusted for certain items to reflect
management’s estimate of our recovery potential after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking
into account structural shifts that we have observed in our sales channels which we expect to
continue as well as store closures and the impact of our Store Optimization Program and the
impact of #ForwardOrganization.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by
factors such as changes in our store network due to the addition of new stores by new openings, acquisitions,
or entering new markets, or due to permanent closure of stores and depreciation and amortization methods,
we believe like-for-like sales growth, EBITDA (= reported EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted
EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA for LTM December 2019 and Management Adjusted EBITDA can provide a
useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated.
We believe a presentation of capital expenditures, free cash flow and cash conversion is useful to investors to
assess our liquidity. For these reasons, we believe that our Non-IFRS Measures and similar measures are widely
used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity.

Our non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS
and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance
with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Each of our non-IFRS Measures is defined and
reconciled to its closest comparable IFRS measure under “Summary – Summary Historical Financial and Other
_Information.” Our non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other_
companies, as not all companies calculate these financial measures in the same manner, and have limitations as
analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results
as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of non-IFRS Measures are that:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or
contractual commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
consolidated statement of comprehensive income;

    - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

    - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

    - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, as well as further limitations discussed above, our Non-IFRS Measures
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance
with IFRS. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our consolidated financial
statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance.

Furthermore, Management Adjusted EBITDA presented in this offering memorandum is illustrative
and presented for information purposes only. Management Adjusted EBITDA is based on Further Adjusted
EBITDA for LTM December 2019. This information does not represent the results that we would have achieved
had the COVID-19 pandemic not occurred. We calculated Management Adjusted EBITDA using information
derived from our unaudited management accounts and which are subject to significant assumptions and
estimates. While we have commissioned a financial factbook for factual accuracy from the consultancy function
of a leading international accounting firm in relation to Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Adjusted

###### xvii

EBITDA has not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting form. Therefore,
Management Adjusted EBITDA is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or
complete picture of our results of operations for any historical or future period, may not be comparable to our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and
should not be unduly relied upon when making an investment decision.

In consideration of the impact of the Transaction, we have also presented the following adjusted
measures:

    - “as adjusted interest expense” is defined as interest expense for the period from January 1, 2020
to December 31, 2020 as if the Transaction had been completed as of January 1, 2020 and
consists of interest on the Notes and the Term Loan B Facility;

    - “as adjusted total senior secured indebtedness” is defined as total senior secured indebtedness
as adjusted for the Transaction reflecting the amounts outstanding under the Notes and the Term
Loan B Facility, as if the Transaction had been completed as of December 31, 2020; and

    - “as adjusted total indebtedness” is defined as total indebtedness as adjusted for the Transaction
reflecting the amounts outstanding under the Notes and the Term Loan B Facility, as if the
Transaction had been completed as of December 31, 2020.

The financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 is unaudited and has been
calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the three months
ended December 31, 2020, (as restated) derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements or the Group’s accounting records or management reporting and the historical financial
information for the financial year 2019/2020, derived from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or
the Group’s accounting records or management reporting, and subtracting the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information for the three months ended December 31, 2019 (as restated), also derived
from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements or the Group’s accounting records or
management reporting. The financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, has not
been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This
information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for such a period or any future period
or any financial position at any past or future date.

The financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 is unaudited and has been
calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the three months
ended December 31, 2019 derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements or the
Group’s accounting records or management reporting and the historical financial information for the financial
year 2019/2020 and subtracting the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the
three months ended December 31, 2018 (as restated), derived from the Group’s accounting records.

This offering memorandum includes certain as adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020, on an adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the Transaction, including
consolidated financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the Transaction on our indebtedness as if the
Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2020 and on our interest expense as if the Transaction had occurred on
January 1, 2020. The as adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the our indebtedness or interest
expense would have been had the Transaction occurred on December 31, 2020, or January 1, 2020, respectively;
nor does it purport to project our indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial
information as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, has not been prepared in accordance with
IFRS or with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any other
generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the
resulting as adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, have been
audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

Rounding

Some financial information in this offering memorandum has been rounded and, as a result, the
figures shown as totals in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of
the figures that precede them.

Other Information

We have commissioned a financial factbook for factual accuracy from the consultancy function of a
leading international accounting firm in preparing Management Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, our Store
Optimization Program (“SOP”) and #ForwardOrganization and associated EBITDA improvements and cash
requirements that we have identified have been developed with a leading global consulting firm.

Overview

We believe we are the leading premium beauty platform in Europe, with total Group sales of
€3,112.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) of €250.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €235.2 million in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The majority of our sales are generated within the selective beauty
distribution channel, which requires the formal authorization of a supplier to carry a selective product, as
opposed to the mass market channel. As of December 31, 2020, we operate in 26 European countries with
over 2,300 stores (including 141 franchised stores) in 20 countries and have e-commerce operations in
24 countries. According to the OC&C Market Review Update, in 2019 we held leading market positions in the
premium beauty market (top 1-2) in all of our core markets except for Spain where we held the number
3 position. In those six core countries, we generated 90.7% of our sales in the financial year 2019/2020. In the
financial year 2019/2020, we had an average number of 21,016 employees (salaried employees and excluding
apprentices).

We believe we operate the leading online beauty platform in our core markets in Europe, with highly
integrated brick & mortar stores and e-commerce customer interfaces which provide our customers with a
comprehensive omnichannel, one-stop shopping experience. In October 2019, we launched our beauty
marketplace in Germany, where we partner with third party retailers and brands to further expand our product
assortment without having to build up inventories. As of December 31, 2020, our marketplace featured 101
partners and offered nearly 84,000 SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). Our total
e-commerce sales amounted to €1,006.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
corresponding to 32.3% of our total sales. In the financial year 2019/2020, our e-commerce sales amounted to
€821.5 million, or 25.4% of our total sales, corresponding to a CAGR of 39.3% during the financial year
2017/2018 to 2019/2020. In Germany, our e-commerce sales comprised 39.9% of our total sales in the financial
year 2019/2020.

We primarily operate under the “Douglas” brand and under the “Nocibé” brand in France and
Monaco. With nearly 130,000 different SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including additional SKUs
from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace), we offer one of the industry’s largest beauty and
personal care product assortments available across a wide range of price points in both our brick & mortar and
online stores. This assortment is complemented by a range of beauty-related nutritional supplements,
accessories such as jewelry, home decorations and selected service offerings.

We believe that we distinguish ourselves with a customer-centric sales approach, by offering our
customers high quality advice and services. As a result, we have an extensive customer loyalty card program.
As of September 30, 2020, we had more than 44 million Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card holders across
Europe. We believe that several factors make us a “must-have” distribution platform for the major suppliers of
beauty products, such as our customer base, reputation, broad, well-invested store network in prime locations,
and e-commerce capabilities.

We believe we are an innovation leader in omnichannel beauty retailing in Europe and already at the
beginning of the financial year 2017/18, we launched our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy where we put our
online business at the center of our focus with the aim of becoming an integrated, data-based beauty platform.
As part of this strategy, we have successfully modernized our brand logo and store design and continue to
make investments in e-commerce. We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and have
started to implement the next phase, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next phase, we are
focusing even more on digitalization to create an integrated beauty platform and link our brick & mortar stores
and e-commerce capabilities. In doing so, we aim to provide a more holistic journey for our customers.

Competitive Strengths

We believe that our business is characterized by the following competitive strengths:

_Number one beauty destination in Europe_

With total Group sales of €3,112.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we believe
we are Europe’s leading beauty platform in our core countries. According to the OC&C Market Review Update,
in 2019 we held leading market positions in the premium beauty market (top 1-2) in all of our core markets
except for Spain where we hold the number 3 position. Our operations in our six core countries generated
90.7% of our sales in the financial year 2019/2020. In Germany, with an estimated market share of 26% in 2019,
we were the clear market leader in the premium beauty market in terms of sales. In France, with an estimated
market share of 16% in 2019, we held the number two position and believe that we have strong market
positions in most of our other markets. Based on the OC&C Market Review Update, we believe that in 2019, we
generated almost the same amount of sales in premium beauty products as our next three closest competitors
combined in our core markets. We had an estimated market share of 19% in our core markets as of
September 30, 2020.

Since the opening of the first Douglas perfumery in 1910 in Hamburg, we have evolved into a highly
trusted brand with a premium image that we believe has become synonymous with beauty in all of our core
markets. Our anchor brand “Douglas” benefits from leading brand awareness across our core markets (other
than France and Spain where we have the second highest brand awareness) with 95% awareness in Germany,
78% awareness in the Netherlands and 72% awareness in Italy and Poland, and our brand “Nocibé” benefits
from 80% brand awareness in France according to the OC&C Market Review, which together drive traffic to our
online shops and brick & mortar stores at low customer acquisition costs. We believe that customers see our
Douglas and Nocibé brands as a synonym for beauty and associate us with being premium, modern and
offering a large, diverse assortment. In addition, we believe that suppliers value our leading market position,
scale, customer reach and pan-European presence, which together make us the partner of choice for both
established and emerging brands as well as provide us with the purchasing power to constantly improve our
purchasing terms (such as higher year-end discounts).

_Leading online beauty platform in Europe_

We believe we are the number 1 European online beauty player in our core countries combined with a
strong presence in the fast growing online premium beauty market. As of December 31, 2020, our online
platform in Germany had nearly 130,000 different SKUs (in Germany, including additional SKUs from
Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace), and featured more than 1,800 brands (as of September 30,
2020), with over 365 new brands added in the financial year 2019/2020. In the financial year 2019/2020, total
visits for our dedicated Douglas App (in Germany, excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) exceeded
39 million. In total, we experienced over 474 million total visits during the financial year 2019/2020. Our
e-commerce sales have grown at a CAGR of over 29.2% in the last 8 years and a CAGR of 39.3% since the
financial year 2017/2018. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our e-commerce sales amounted
to €1,006.3 million, representing 32.3% of our total sales for the period.

We believe that we benefit from a growing base of recurring online customers and especially
omnichannel who have historically made stable revenue contributions and have continued to increase in
number even during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has
fundamentally changed customer behavior and further accelerated the shift towards online retailing even
outside of national lockdowns. For example, even though most of our stores were open from June to October
following the first wave of national lockdowns, our e-commerce sales increased from €219 million between
June 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 to €325 million between June 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 while our
e-commerce Adjusted EBITDA increased from €25 million between June 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 to
€48 million between June 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. In addition, in the financial year 2019/2020, our total
visits and active customers amounted to 474 million and 10 million, respectively, representing an increase of
39.3% and 40.6%, respectively, as compared to the previous year. In Germany in the financial year 2019/2020,
the share of sales (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, including VAT) attributable to mobile revenue
increased by 1.9 percentage points to 64.1% of our total e-commerce sales in Germany, including an increase
in the share of sales attributable to our Douglas App, which increased by 3.9 percentage points to 23.7% of our
total e-commerce sales in Germany. Over the same period in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty), our conversion rate, defined as the proportion of site visitors who complete the purchasing process,
among our Douglas Beauty Card holders remained relatively stable at 3.6% and the average e-commerce
basket size of Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, including


###### 2


-----

VAT and before sales deductions, which are in this specific case liabilities deducted from sales arising when
customers use points from their Douglas Beauty Cards earned through purchases to get products discounts or
vouchers on future purchases) increased by 9.8% to €65 as compared to the previous year. For the financial
year 2019/2020 in Germany, (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty), our average cost per online order
was €6.78, and our online acquisition cost decreased at a CAGR of 5.2% since the financial year 2017/2018.

We continue to invest in our e-commerce capabilities and in the financial year 2019/2020, launched
our “Douglas LIVE” shopping service where our beauty advisors, influencers and brand testimonials introduce
products via livestream that can be immediately purchased by customers as well as a “ship-from-store” delivery
option. To further complement our online platform, we launched the first dedicated European premium beauty
marketplace in October 2019 (initially in Germany, and in France and Austria in 2020) and generated total
platform sales of approximately €13 million in the first quarter 2020/2021. Through our marketplace, we
exclusively partner with third party retailers and brands to further expand our product assortment and revenue
streams and enter new product categories such as pharma beauty, jewelry, home accessories and fashion
without having to build up inventories or incur logistics costs. As of December 31, 2020, our marketplace
featured 101 partners including beauty suppliers like Talea, online pharmacies like apo-rot (belonging to the
Doc Morris Group), or vendors of accessories and jewelry like Brandfield, Butlers or Christ and offered nearly
84,000 different SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). In addition, we believe that our
marketplace boosts cross-selling through increased online traffic and provides additional data to improve our
data analytics and customer view. The marketplace function is currently active in our online shops in Germany,
Austria and France. It is expected to be rolled out to Poland in March 2021 and we are planning to add other
core markets such as the Netherlands and Italy in the financial year 2020/2021.

_Diversified leader with strong omnichannel operations in large, structurally growing and resilient European_
_beauty market_

The European premium beauty market in our core markets totaled €13.8 billion in 2019 and has
demonstrated resilience in challenging retail trading environments and partly through the COVID-19
pandemic. Beauty products (fragrances, skin care (including body care) and also color cosmetics) are often
perceived as accessible high-value gifts and so-called “personal rewards”, which has contributed to the
demand for such products remaining relatively stable. The market historically saw a balanced split between
product categories with skin and body care, fragrances, makeup and hair cosmetics accounting for 46%, 20%,
16% and 18% of the total market, respectively, in 2019. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic such
as the increased use of masks as well as working from home have led to an increase in our sales of skin and
body care products and a decrease in our sales of makeup products.

The European beauty market is increasingly shifting to the premium segment, with high margin luxury,
niche and prestige products accounting for 36% of the market in 2019. The European beauty market in our
core markets grew at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2015 and 2019 with the premium segment growing at a CAGR
of 2.9% over the same period. Within the premium segment, the share of e-commerce sales has more than
doubled in size between 2015 and 2019.

We believe that our intuitive and comprehensive omnichannel offering across our online and offline
channels makes us an attractive partner for suppliers and also well-placed to capitalize on growth in the
underlying European beauty market. We focus mainly on the premium beauty market, an attractive
sub-segment of the broader beauty and personal care market where manufacturers of premium brands limit
the distribution of their products to selected qualified retailers. Suppliers thus favor trusted retailers with strong
brand awareness who can offer appropriate brand presentation and store appearance, high levels of customer
service from specially trained employees, breadth of product assortment and broad customer and
geographical reach. As a result, we believe that the high integration of our online and mobile interfaces and
brick & mortar stores helps ensure that brands are positioned appropriately and make us an attractive partner
for suppliers.

In addition, we believe that customers in the beauty retail sector increasingly shop online to save time,
money and effort, but still wish to see, touch, feel, smell and test products in person in the store. To further
enhance our customer’s omnichannel shopping experience, we offer a number of highly integrated crosschannel services along various customer touch points, covering pre-sales information, stock availability,
consultation, payment as well as delivery of products and returns. These services include in-store orders, click &
collect, “ship from store” delivery, online stock information, online appointment scheduling before store visits
as well as cross-channel couponing. For the financial year 2019/2020, in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams
and Niche Beauty), our average return cycle in days was 2.49. In the financial year 2019/2020, the percentage
of customers who purchased additional products during click & collect was 18.9% (in Germany excluding
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty).


###### 3


-----

Among our Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty),
the share of our customers shopping via the omnichannel model has increased from 12.4% in the financial year
2016/2017 to 17.4% in the financial year 2019/2020. The share of customers shopping via the omnichannel was
approximately twice as high among customers who were beauty card holders aged 16-35 years old. In
addition, we believe that the omnichannel model increases customer engagement. For example, these
omnichannel customers have a higher order frequency and therefore annual sales than customers who use
only one channel. Among Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty) in the financial year 2019/2020, customer spend per year and number of purchases per year per
customer for our omnichannel customers was twice as high as compared to customers who shopped only
online or in our brick & mortar stores.

_Well-placed for future growth via differentiated #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy_

We believe we are an innovation leader in omnichannel beauty retailing in Europe and already at the
beginning of the financial year 2017/18, we launched our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy where we put our
online business at the center of our business with the aim of becoming an integrated, data-driven beauty
platform. The strategy was based on the following pillars and we believe repositioned us as a modern,
premium brand that is well-placed for future growth. We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY
strategy and have started to implement the next phase, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next
phase, we are focusing even more on digitalization to further develop integrated beauty platform and link our
brick & mortar stores and e-commerce capabilities. In doing so, we aim to provide a more holistic journey for
our customers. See “Strategy—Further implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst.”

_Brand positioning._ We rejuvenated the Douglas brand with a new, updated logo, more modern and
premium positioning as well as new visual brand language.

_Store experience._ We are developing our stores from being a point of sale to a point of experience
for customers. We have established store clusters and invested in related store modernizations in order to
facilitate a more tailored approach to each store’s assortment, visual presentation, services and pricing.
Formats range from flagship stores in high traffic locations in major cities that carry our full assortment and
feature premium visual merchandising, luxury stores in high-end locations that carry luxury and niche brands
and feature a more boutique design, prestige stores in premium neighborhoods that carry “must have” and
trend brands and feature a sophisticated design and premium stores in prime shopping locations that focus on
bestsellers and feature a more mainstream design. To enhance the “touch and feel” experience for customers,
each store format also features a range of services such as beauty treatments, hairdressing and beauty school
sessions. We believe that our new flagship stores, which have been established in key European cities such as
Frankfurt, Berlin, Milan, Madrid, Hamburg and Munich, provide a best-in-class customer experience with
features such as organic beauty products, niche perfumes, beauty lounges with treatment rooms as well as
dedicated customer service stations.

_Assortment._ We have a broad assortment, featuring nearly 130,000 different SKUs on our online
platform (in Germany, including additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace),
which represents over twice the number of SKUs offered by our closest competitor. Our attractive product
portfolio is balanced between fragrances, color cosmetics, skin care, and other products, which each
comprised approximately 48%, 23%, 27% and 2% of our total sales in Germany (including our marketplace,
excluding Swiss e-commerce, Parfumdreams, and Niche Beauty) for the financial year 2019/2020, respectively.
We feature many different major regional and international brands such as Chanel, Lancôme, Kiehl’s, The
Ordinary and Tom Ford sourced from suppliers with whom we maintain strong and often long-term
relationships. In addition, we complement our broad assortment of selective products with products from
exclusive brands such as Kylie Skin, Honest Beauty and Drunk Elephant and own brand products. In October
2019, we further bolstered our assortment with the launch in Germany of the first dedicated European
premium beauty marketplace from an omnichannel player, which as of December 31, 2020, contributed nearly
84,000 different SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) through our third-party retail
and brand partners. We believe that properly curating our assortment is a key factor in customer retention and
continue to identify new product categories and source emerging brands via our trend scouting process.

_Customer relationship management._ We have an extensive customer loyalty card program, which we
believe is one of the largest among premium beauty in Europe. As of September 30, 2020, we had more than
44 million Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card holders across Europe. As part of our
#FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we have adopted a data-centric approach to our customer
relationship management. Using customer behavioral data collected from online purchases, use of our loyalty
card and our marketing channels, our customer relationship management analytics allow us to personalize all
future customer interactions across all channels by clustering customers into segments and providing them


###### 4


-----

with tailored product recommendations, product news and other content. We believe that such personalized
curation drives customer loyalty. In the financial year 2019/2020 in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and
Niche Beauty), the number of purchases per year per customer was 3.0 for Douglas Beauty Card holders and
5.4 for Douglas Beauty Card holders who used the Douglas App. Over the same period in Germany (excluding
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty and including VAT), the average spend per customer was €52.1 for Douglas
Beauty Card holders and €53.4 for Douglas Beauty Card holders who used the Douglas App (compared to
€50.8 for all customers in Germany). In addition, our customer interaction rates on our e-commerce platform
have significantly increased, with our average daily social media reach (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty) amounting to 3.1 million in the financial year 2018/2019 and increasing to 8.0 million in the financial
year 2019/2020. For the financial year 2020, in Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, we had average
online traffic of over 500,000 customers per day.

_Technology._ We believe that our established technological infrastructure, comprised of our seamless
and comprehensive omnichannel offering across online and offline channels, our state-of-the-art supply chain
and flexible logistics network and our data-driven customer relationship management system, has enabled us
to cope with changing customer behavior, in particular, the shift towards online retailing, which has accelerated
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have updated our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and are now implementing the next phase, known
as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. See “—Strategy—Further implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst
_strategy” below._

_Solid financial profile with strong momentum before COVID-19 that achieved market share gains in last_
_financial year_

We believe that we demonstrated the resilience of our business during the COVID-19 pandemic,
having achieved segment share gains in the total premium beauty market across our core markets in both our
online and store channels, including increases in overall segment share of 1.6 percentage points to 45.5% in
Germany, 1.6 percentage points to 28.3% in France, 0.1 percentage points to 11.8% in Spain and 0.5
percentage points to 24.6% in Italy for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the
previous year (excluding certain competitors such as Amazon e-commerce and Flaconi in Germany).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our consolidated sales had consistently grown over the last 8 years,
supported by organic growth, strategic acquisitions and the implementation of our #FORWARDBEAUTY
strategy, and our total consolidated sales amounted to €3.45 billion in the financial year 2018/2019. Bolstered
by investments and initiatives undertaken in 2017 such as a new pricing strategy in Germany to optimize our
price positioning, cost optimization measures aimed at maximizing operational efficiencies, achieving cost
discipline and right-sizing our existing store portfolio as well as significant brand investments to increase sales
of our own brand products and increase exclusive brand partnerships, our like-for-like total Group sales grew
1.9% from the financial year 2017/2018 to the financial year 2018/2019. In addition, we exhibit strong
underlying free cash flow generation due to our high margins, low capital expenditures comprised mainly of
investments in stores and central organizational functions and strict working capital management.

We have acted quickly in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to preserve the strength of our
business. For example, we have worked to preserve business continuity and cash flow generation by
implementing health and safety measures across all our stores in accordance with government guidelines,
focusing on store-to-customer delivery in our core market of Germany and significantly expanding our
e-commerce capabilities through establishing a call center for online shoppers, increasing customer
engagement through push notifications on our Douglas App as well as offering click & collect services in the
second wave of lockdowns. We believe that our response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the shift in
customer demand to e-commerce have resulted in like-for-like sales for e-commerce increasing by 58.2% for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the previous year and our total e-commerce
sales exceeding €1 billion for the first time in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our
brick & mortar gross profit margin remained relatively stable from 46.4% in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 to 45.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 while our e-commerce gross
profit margin also remained relatively stable from 41.0% to 40.8% over the same period. While our brick &
mortar Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 14.4% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to
10.3% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our e-commerce Adjusted EBITDA margin increased
from 14.6% to 16.2% over the same period.

We are also actively managing our liquidity needs though strict cost and cash management and
reporting, negotiating rent for our leased premises and taking advantage of rent deferrals where available,
actively managing personnel expenses and working with suppliers to extend payments terms and manage
returns. As a result, excluding proceeds from our drawdown of our existing revolving credit facility, our cash on
balance sheet amounted to €90.8 million as of September 30, 2020 as compared to €81.0 million (excluding
proceeds from our drawdown of our existing revolving credit facility) as of September 30, 2019.

_Experienced and committed management team with strong sponsor support_

We have an experienced executive management team with more than 70 years of combined

Group and has over 14 years of experience in the field of retail digitization and e-commerce. Dr. Michael
Keppel has over 25 years of restructuring experience, especially in the wholesale and retail industry. We
believe that our management team has successfully transformed us over the past few years from a traditional,
brick & mortar beauty retailer into a modern, technology and data-driven beauty platform that is a leading
beauty destination in Europe.

We continue to have strong shareholder support, including from CVC, a leading private equity and
investment advisory firm with approximately U.S.$118 billion assets under management and which has to date
secured commitments of over U.S.$160 billion from some of the world’s leading institutional investors. To
support the Transaction, our shareholders, including the CVC Funds and the Founder Co-Investors, the Kreke
family, will indirectly contribute cash of €220 million.

Strategy

In order to achieve sustainable growth and further increase our profitability, we focus on clearly
defined key strategic objectives, leveraging the various strategic and operational measures we have
implemented. Our strategic goals can be summarized as follows:

_Further implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst_

We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and intend to implement the next
stage, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next phase, we are focusing on further digitalization in
order to create a holistic journey for our customers that spans across an integrated beauty platform that
intuitively links our brick & mortar stores and e-commerce platform. Our strategy is comprised of the following
elements:

_Brand Positioning:_ As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, we rejuvenated and upgraded the
Douglas brand. We continue to focus on our positioning as a premium brand. In addition, we believe that
strong niche brands like Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty complement our brand portfolio and attract different
customer groups.

_Store experience._ As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, we began developing our stores from
being a point of sale to a point of experience for customers and are continuing to invest in store
modernizations and formats.

_Assortment._ We believe that our broad assortment, which amounted to nearly 130,000 different
SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and
our marketplace), differentiates us from our competitors and will continue to build our relationships with
suppliers with the aim of being their partner of choice for their top brands. We will also continue to add
partners to our marketplace in order to strengthen our online platform as a one-stop-shop for beauty for our
customers. We also intend to selectively enter new product categories that we believe are suitable for our
business model such as the health and wellbeing segment.

_Supply chain transformation._ We are in the process of centralizing and streamlining our supply chain
by integrating our physical and digital supply chain. We are moving towards a One Warehouse, All Channels
(“OWAC”) approach to physical supply chain where each of our logistic facilities will service our physical stores
and e-commerce platform as well as handle partner fulfillment for our marketplace by carrying up to 150,000
SKUs per site. We intend to anchor our logistics operations with five distribution centers across Europe and in
December 2020, started construction on the first site in Germany, which is fixed with ARVATO to serve the
region Germany (excluding Niche Beauty), Austria, Switzerland the Netherlands (which based on sales
represented approximately 50% of the Group’s supply chain) which is expected to ship out its first orders in
2022. We currently expect that all five facilities will be owned, staffed and managed by third party logistics
partners and thus will require no material capital expenditures. In addition, we began in December 2020 to
digitalize our entire supply chain management with AI-powered forecasting and replenishment software with
machine learning algorithms from RELEX solutions that we believe will enable us to increase product
availability, improve inventory allocation, accelerate stock rotation in stores, improve labor productivity in
stores and logistics facilities, and improve the impact of our marketing campaigns. The new system is currently
being implemented in Germany and we expect the full transformation of our supply chain management to be
complete in the next three years.

_Data hub._ Data is the key element of our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy. We have
developed and with each additional customer transaction, are continuing to build a Douglas data hub that
collects data from our stores, our customer relationship management system, our website, our Douglas App


###### 7


-----

and retail and marketplace data, as well as our performance marketing data. We intend to use this growing
collection of data to train our machine learning algorithms, which in turn will enable us to manage our internal
processes more efficiently, improve individualized customer offers and ultimately drive profitability.

_Curation/CRM._ We will continue to build and refine our data-centric customer relationship
management system, which will enable us to deliver 1:1 marketing to customers by harmonizing customer data
and customer journey tracking to allow more personalized curation across all channels in order to drive higher
conversion rates and increase basket sizes. For example, we have introduced features such as individualized
product news, beauty tips and product recommendations in our personalized newsletter (of which we sent
over 1.2 billion copies across Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain in the financial year 2019/2020), a
personalized start page when customers visit our online shop, replenishment reminders and personalized push
notifications through our Douglas App.

_Complement accelerating e-commerce channel with Store Optimization Program_

We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the shift towards online retailing. As
a result, in the summer of 2020, we began to reevaluate our store network based on economic viability and
strategic fit in a post-COVID-19 “new normal”. Following a top-down and detailed bottom-up analysis of our
store network supported by external experts, we have created our SOP to actively improve profitability of our
store network. Our SOP target is to close approximately 500 stores by the end of September 2022 across our
network with a focus on Southern Europe, where there is a high store density within numerous catchment areas
due to our historical acquisitions. To implement the SOP optimally and ensure well-managed store closures, we
have developed detailed operational playbooks. We also have established a dedicated external team that
reports directly to our CRO and engages with our country implementation teams to ensure that best practices
are shared, and progress is tracked. In addition, we are in the process of optimizing staffing levels at our stores
to improve efficiency and react to the reduction in store traffic as well as COVID-19-inflicted changes in
customer behavior. As part of our SOP, we are also targeting rent improvements and intend to actively
re-negotiate leases with our landlords for stores that will remain open. Based on the various elements of our
SOP, we have identified potential for an overall improvement in our EBITDA of approximately €100 million as
well as one-off net cash requirements (excluding any additional legal and consulting fees) of approximately
€53 million by the end of the financial year 2021/2022. These costs have been reflected to a smaller degree in
our financial statements, as the SOP was announced in January 2021, but execution has partially started
beforehand.

_Launch #ForwardOrganization in line with digital first strategy_

In line with our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we intend to implement
#ForwardOrganization, which aims to standardize, harmonize and centralize aspects of our internal functions in
order to improve efficiency and realize synergies across regions. As a first step, we have started the
centralization of certain key functions such as e-commerce, customer relationship management and pricing. In
connection with #ForwardOrganization, we have identified the potential for an overall improvement in our
EBITDA of approximately €18-20 million as well as one-off cash effects (excluding any additional legal and
consulting fees) of approximately €25 million.

The Transaction

On the Issue Date, the Issuers will issue the Notes offered hereby and use the proceeds of the
Offering, together with proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, and a €220 million indirect cash contribution by our shareholders (the “Equity
Contribution”) to (1) fund the redemption of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and Existing Senior Notes;
(2) repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities (including amounts outstanding
under the existing revolving credit facility); (3) fund cash on hand and (4) pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection therewith (together, the “Transaction”).

Post-Closing Reorganization

Immediately after the Issue Date, it is the current intention to merge the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
into the Parent and subsequently to merge the surviving entity into TopCo (the “Post-Closing Mergers”). As a
result of the Post-Closing Mergers, all intercompany liabilities between TopCo, the Parent and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer would cease to exist by operation of law. In addition, TopCo, as the surviving entity, will
acquire all of the rights and assets, and will assume all of the obligations, of the Parent and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer. As a result, TopCo would become the successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer and will assume all
of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In addition, the Note Guarantees of TopCo and the
Parent will be extinguished.


###### 8


-----

Following completion of the Post-Closing Mergers, LuxCo 3 and MEP 2 KG will establish or acquire KB
A, a German company to be formed following the Issue Date in connection with the Post-Closing
Reorganization that will initially be the direct subsidiary of LuxCo 3. LuxCo 3 will then contribute the Senior PIK
Notes Issuer into the share premium of KB A such that KB A will become the new direct parent and sole
shareholder of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer. The shares of TopCo held by LuxCo 3 and MEP 2 KG will then be
contributed into the Senior PIK Notes Issuer such that the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will become the new direct
parent and sole shareholder of TopCo. In connection with such steps, any security granted over the shares of
the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and TopCo, as applicable, in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior PIK
Notes, as applicable, will be released and retaken. In addition, KB A will assume the obligations of TopCo
under the Shareholder Loans and consequently, the security granted over the Shareholder Loans in favor of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior PIK Notes will be released. The steps referred to in this paragraph are
together, the “Senior PIK Issuer Reorganization” and together with the Post-Closing Mergers, the “Post-Closing
Reorganization”).

Following the Post-Closing Reorganization, further profit and loss transfer agreements may be entered
into between KB A, the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in order to create a
consolidated tax group between such entities.

There is no assurance that all or any of the steps of the Post-Closing Reorganization will be completed
in the anticipated timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—The interests of our
_shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our_
_Structure—The Issuers are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries or other group entities to meet its_
_obligations on the Notes and the Note Guarantees”._

Recent Developments

_Impact of COVID-19_

The global outbreak of COVID-19 has had a significant effect on our industry and our business. To
reduce the spread of COVID-19, governmental authorities across the countries where we operate
implemented measures such as restrictions on travel and the closure of national borders, as well as the
imposition of quarantines, stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, curfews, limitations on building
occupancies and other social distancing measures.

A significant feature of these measures was the order for non-essential shops to temporarily close
during two waves of national lockdowns beginning in March 2020. These measures led to the temporary closure
of the majority of our brick & mortar stores for periods throughout 2020. For example, by the beginning of April
2020, nearly all of our stores were closed. Although the majority of our stores slowly re-opened after the end of
April 2020 dependent on the countries where they are located, some stores remained closed or closed again
during subsequent lockdowns or are operating with reduced workforces and shortened opening hours. As of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, the majority of our stores in Germany and Poland and slightly more than
half of our stores in France remain closed. Our stores in the Netherlands have recently reopened on a
by-appointment basis. As a result, our store traffic and sales have not reached pre-lockdown levels. For example,
in our six core countries, as of December 31, 2020, only 53.7% of our stores were open. The drop in customer
footfall in many locations led to significantly lower brick & mortar sales, and in the periods following the
lockdown, extended hygiene measures (such as requirements to provide disinfectants, wear masks and limits on
the number of customers in our stores) had to be implemented in stores for the health and safety of our
customers and employees, which also resulted in lower footfall. Despite the decrease in sales, fixed costs,
particularly in the form of personnel and rental expenses, have not fallen to the same extent. Overall, the
COVID-19 pandemic primarily contributed to a decline of our brick & mortar sales by 15.8% in financial year
2019/2020 compared to the financial year 2018/2019 and 28.8% in the first quarter of 2020/2021 compared to
the first quarter of the prior year.


###### 9


-----

We have taken and continue to take a number of actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in
particular the expansion of our e-commerce capabilities and related customer support, focusing on tight cash
management, negotiating rent for our leased premises and taking advantage of rent deferrals where available,
actively managing personnel expenses, taking advantage of government subsidies such as short-term work or
temporary dismissals, and working with suppliers to extend payments terms and manage returns. In addition, we
believe that our experience from the first wave of lockdowns implemented across Europe in spring 2020
prepared us for the second wave of lockdowns in the second half of 2020. For example, we increased our
warehouse capacities to support growing e-commerce sales, further enlarged our assortment to nearly 130,000
different SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche
Beauty and our marketplace) and further established alternative order channels including ship from store, click &
collect and orders placed over the telephone. It is difficult to predict the medium to long-term effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the European premium beauty market and we continue to closely monitor any
decisions taken by the governments in the regions where we operate.

In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the shift towards online
retailing even outside of national lockdowns, which has in turn positively affected our e-commerce sales. For
example, in the period from June to October 2020, when our stores were predominantly opened following the
first wave of lockdowns, our e-commerce net sales increased to €325 million, a 48.4% increase compared to the
same period in the prior year and our store net sales decreased to €926 million, a 9.8% decrease compared to
the same period in the prior year. Over the same period, our e-commerce Adjusted EBITDA increased to
€48 million, a 97% increase compared to the same period in the prior year and our store Adjusted EBITDA
decreased to €74 million, a 41% decrease compared to the same period in the prior year.

The chart below sets out our like-for-like monthly sales growth by channel (excluding the segment
“Others”) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as well as the percentage of our stores that
remained open over the same period (calculated based on average end of the week (Friday) data per month).

The German government imposed a second lockdown from December 16, 2020, which was recently
extended generally to April 18, 2021. On January 14, 2021, the French government announced new measures
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a stricter curfew that was extended to the entire country. On
January 31, 2021, France closed its borders to all non-EU countries, except for hauliers, and as of the date of this
offering memorandum, the curfew remains in place. From midnight on March 19, 2021, a further lockdown took
effect in certain regions of France including in Paris and its surrounding region. In addition, in the Netherlands, a
national lockdown and curfew is currently slated to remain in place until April 20, 2021. In Poland, the
government announced a new nationwide lockdown starting on March 20, 2021 until at least April 9, 2021. As of
March 25, 2021, nearly two-thirds of our stores were open (including on a by-appointment basis for “click &
meet”) across our six core countries.

_Store Optimization Program_

In light of the shift in customer behavior towards online retailing, which has been accelerated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, we have launched our Store Optimization Program (“SOP”). Our SOP targets closing
approximately 500 stores by the end of September 2022 across our network with a focus on Southern Europe,
where our sales from brick & mortar stores were particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and where
there is currently high overlap in store locations due to our historical acquisitions. The chart below sets out the
progress made on our SOP as of February 16, 2021.

_Paragraph on Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern in Auditor’s Report_

The auditor’s report in relation to the audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year
2019/2020 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum contains a material uncertainty paragraph in
relation to going concern. As described in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the
financial year 2019/2020, as a result of the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our business, in particular the
temporary closure of the majority of our brick & mortar stores for periods throughout 2020, there is uncertainty
in relation to our ability to forecast our pace of recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
eventual levels to which our results of operations will return as well as our cash flows, which are in each case
dependent on the re-opening of our brick & mortar stores, any future government-imposed restrictions or
lockdowns in the countries where we operate that result in further store closures as well as developments that
could offset the effects of brick & mortar store closures such as the continued shift towards online retailing as
well as the optimization of our store network through our SOP. These events or conditions, along with the other
matters as set forth in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020,
including that our Existing Senior Secured Notes, our Existing Senior Notes and our Existing Senior Secured
Facilities mature in 2022 and 2023 and liquidity risks from extended periods of store closures, indicate that a
material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. In
addition, the notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for the first quarter
2020/2021 include a note setting out the risks described above as representing material uncertainty related to
a going concern risk for the Group.

_Current Trading_

Based on unaudited preliminary management accounts, our sales for the two months ended
February 28, 2021 amounted to approximately €352 million. Our preliminary management accounts indicate
that our sales are approximately 31% lower than in the comparable period in 2020. In addition, based on
unaudited preliminary management accounts, our brick & mortar sales for the two months ended February 28,
2021 amounted to approximately €167 million, which are approximately 58% lower than in the comparable
period in 2020. Based on unaudited preliminary management accounts, our e-commerce sales for the two
months ended February 28, 2021 amounted to approximately €185 million, which are approximately 82%
higher than in the comparable period in 2020. The developments in our sales, brick & mortar sales and
e-commerce sales are due to lockdowns in certain countries where we operate. Based on unaudited
preliminary management accounts, our cash and cash equivalents as of February 28, 2021 was approximately
€226 million (including cash borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and ancillary facilities in an
aggregate principal amount of €142.6 million).

The foregoing financial information is based on internal unaudited consolidated monthly accounts for
the months of January and February 2021, which were prepared by and are the responsibility of our
management. This financial information has not been audited, reviewed, compiled or the subject of any
procedures by our independent auditors or any other audit firm and no opinion nor any other form of
assurance is expressed with respect thereto. The foregoing financial information is inherently subject to
modification and should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person
regarding our future financial performance. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more
complete discussion of certain factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations.

(4) On the Issue Date, the Senior PIK Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer, secured by the Senior
PIK Notes Collateral. The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that, on or prior to November 30, 2021 and if PostClosing Reorganization has not been completed, the Senior PIK Notes will also be secured by a first-priority security
interest over the shares of the direct parent company of TopCo and receivables owed by such parent company.

(5) On the Issue Date, the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will loan the proceeds of the Senior PIK Notes to TopCo via the Proceeds
Loan, having terms described under “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—The Proceeds Loan.” The claims under the
Proceeds Loan, will be pledged, on a first-priority basis, to secure the Senior Secured Facilities and the Senior Secured
Notes, and on a second-priority basis, the Senior PIK Notes.

(6) On or prior to the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will enter into the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement,
which provides for committed facilities comprised of the Term Loan B Facility in an amount of €600 million and the
Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of €170.0 million. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be one of several Original
RCF Borrowers. The Original TLB Borrowers are expected to be members of the Restricted Group in Germany, France
and the Netherlands, which may include Douglas GmbH, Parfümerie Douglas GmbH, Douglas Einkaufs-und
Servicegesellschaft mbH & Co. KG, Douglas Finance B.V., Kirk Beauty Netherlands B.V., Parfümerie Douglas GmbH,
Groupe Nocibé S.A.S. and Nocibé France S.A.S. The Senior Secured Facilities will be senior obligations of the relevant
borrowers and, on or prior to a date falling 30 days or 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, will be guaranteed by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, all Guarantors that guarantee the Notes and, additionally, by certain subsidiaries of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated in France and Italy that will not guarantee the Notes. On or prior to a date
falling 30 days or 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the Senior Secured Facilities will be secured by the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes, and additionally, by other
collateral granted by security providers incorporated in France or Italy that will not secure the obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral, priority and ranking of the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the liability of the Guarantors are subject to
the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
_the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” In addition, certain debt incurred in connection with a government support_
scheme or certain other state-backed financing and following a complete refinancing of the Senior Secured Facilities,
debt incurred under certain credit facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations may
be designated as having super senior status with respect to the recovery of proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral. See also “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. It is
intended that in connection with the Transaction, the Term Loan B facility will be drawn in full. We expect the Revolving
Credit Facility to be undrawn as of the Issue Date, other than the rollover of ancillary facilities and letters of credit that
had been established or issued under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities Agreement. The commitments made
available under these facilities may be increased in the future.

(7) On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, secured by
the Senior Secured Notes Issue Date Collateral, including shares of TopCo held by LuxCo 3 and MEP 2 KG. On or prior
to a date falling (a) on the later of the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Notes Post-Closing Collateral (as
defined herein) secures the Senior Secured Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on
which the relevant Senior Secured Notes Post-Closing Collateral secures the Senior Secured Facilities and 90 days after
the Issue Date, as applicable, the Senior Secured Notes will be additionally secured by the Senior Secured Notes PostClosing Collateral. The Senior Secured Notes will benefit from a loss sharing agreement with the lenders under the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement whereby payments may be required to be made among the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement in order to ensure that losses are borne
proportionately by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lender under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement based on the exposure of all such creditors on an enforcement date. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors.”_

(8) On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Issue Date Guarantors and the
Senior PIK Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Issue Date Guarantors. In addition on or prior
to a date falling (a) on the later of the date on which such Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior
Secured Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which such Post-Closing Guarantor
provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the Senior Secured
Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Post-Closing Guarantors and the Senior PIK Notes will be guaranteed
on a senior subordinated basis by the Post-Closing Guarantors. The Note Guarantees will be subject to certain
contractual limitations and limitations under applicable law, as described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Structure—Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.” As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (who is also a_
Guarantor of the Senior PIK Notes) together with the Guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes (excluding TopCo, which is
a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations, material
assets (other than the shares it owns in its subsidiaries and intragroup receivables) or liabilities (other than intragroup
liabilities that will be extinguished following completion of the Post-Closing Mergers)), accounted for 37.3% of the

Mergers, TopCo, as the surviving entity, will become the successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured
Note Guarantees of TopCo and the Parent will be extinguished. See “Summary – Post-Closing Reorganization” and

Reorganization, after which KB A, a German company to be formed following the Issue Date in connection with the PostClosing Reorganization, will become the new direct parent of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and the Senior PIK Notes Issuer
will become the new direct parent of TopCo. See “Summary—Post-Closing Reorganization”.

such time, will become a party to the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and guarantee the Senior PIK Notes on a senior basis as

secured by a first-priority security interest over the shares of, and receivables owed by, LuxCo 3 as further described in

Additional Amounts; Tax Any payments made by or on behalf of the relevant Issuer, any future
Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . guarantor or applicable paying agent with respect to the Notes will
be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant
taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. Subject to certain
exceptions and limitations, if the relevant Issuer or applicable future
guarantor or paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct
such taxes with respect to a payment on any Note, the relevant
Issuer or such future guarantor will pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amount received after such withholding is
not less than the amount that would have been received in the
absence of the withholding. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—_

###### 25


-----

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction
become effective after the issuance of the Notes that would impose
withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the
Notes, and would require the relevant Issuer to pay Additional
Amounts (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—_
_Withholding Taxes”), the relevant Issuer may redeem the Notes in_
whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of
the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Redemption for_
_Taxation Reasons”._

###### Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Because no portion of the stated interest on the Senior PIK Notes is unconditionally payable in cash at least annually, no stated interest payments on the Senior PIK Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Senior PIK Notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the total payments of principal and stated interest on the Notes over their issue price. Holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income, irrespective of their regular method of tax accounting. See “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Senior PIK Notes.”

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the
applicable Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred if a certain consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceed in
connection with such event. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—_
_Change of Control”._

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indentures will limit, among other things, the ability of TopCo
and its restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes) and the Senior PIK Notes Issuer, TopCo and their respective
restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior PIK Notes) to:

                     - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                     - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                     - make certain other restricted payments;

                       - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                       - impose restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to
pay dividends;


###### 26


-----

                       - transfer or sell certain assets;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                      - engage in certain activities (with respect to TopCo and Parent in
case of Senior Secured Notes and with respect to Topco, the
Parent and the Senior PIK Notes Issuer in case of Senior PIK
Notes);

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                       - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we
achieve investment-grade ratings. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on_
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status” and “Description of the_
_Senior PIK Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on_
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status”._

Each of the covenants in the Indentures will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—_
_Certain Covenants”._

Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In connection with any tender offer for the relevant series of
###### Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the applicable Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the applicable Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem all of the relevant series of Notes, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

(1) EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) (calculated as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise

be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the consolidated statements of profit or loss,
consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS.
Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) as shown in this offering
memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA (= reported
EBITDA) as shown in the table above is unadjusted. See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

(2) EBIT (calculated as EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) minus amortization/depreciation/impairment) is not defined as a
measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBIT should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the
consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow
statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBIT in the same way, EBIT as shown in
this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBIT as shown

(1) Net sales growth (in %) is defined as the difference between the sales in the period indicated and the sales in the
comparable previous period divided by the sales in said comparable previous period.

(2) E-commerce sales are defined as the sum of all invoiced sales relating to products and services by customer orders via
websites, internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets
(so-called “t” sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a
mobile or “smart” telephone) and, for Germany, telephone orders after cancellations and backorders, as well as rebates,
discounts and returns, disregarding any stock transfer from e-commerce to brick & mortar business. E-commerce sales
for the financial years ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 are audited. E-commerce sales of the financial year
2017/2018 do not include sales from click & collect in France in the amount of €15.6 million that are presented as brick &
mortar sales.

(3) Like-for-like sales growth (in %) is defined as sales growth from like-for-like brick & mortar and from e-Commerce,
calculated for the period indicated and shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period.

(4) Like-for-like sales growth (brick & mortar) (in %) consists of sales growth from like-for-like stores. A store is defined as
like-for-like per each financial year when it has been open for at least one entire financial year as of the first day of the
relevant period (excluding any temporary closures for COVID-19 related reasons), and is expected to be open for the full
financial year. When comparing periods other than a financial year, e.g. the first quarters of the financial years 2018/2019
and 2019/2020, a store is defined as like-for-like if the store has been open in both first quarters and for at least one

entire financial year (i.e. financial year 2018/2019, excluding any temporary closures for COVID-19 related reasons) and
is expected to be open for the full financial year (i.e. financial year 2019/2020). One exception for the definition has been
applied to the calculation of like-for-like sales from financial year 2017/2018 to financial year 2018/2019: In November
2017, we acquired Limoni S.p.A. (“Limoni”) and La Gardenia Beauty S.p.A. (“La Gardenia”). The acquired stores would
not qualify as like-for-like since they only contributed 11 months instead of a full fiscal year and were moreover affected
by numerous closings in financial year 2017/2018 and financial year 2018/2019. However, due to the size of the
acquisition compared to the gap between 11 months and full fiscal year, we included the Italian acquisition in the
like-for-like total for the financial year 2018/2019. As a result, like-for-like growth for financial year 2018/2019 on a Group
total level has been reduced from 2.6% to 1.9% (brick & mortar from 0.4% to 0.2%). In the financial year 2017/2018, our
brick & mortar sales included click & collect sales in France in the amount of €15.6 million. These click & collect sales
were classified as e-commerce sales in subsequent periods.

(5) Like-for-like sales growth (e-commerce) (in %) reflects our organic e-commerce sales growth, calculated for the period
indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period. In the financial year 2017/2018, our
e-commerce sales did not include click & collect sales in France in the amount of €15.6 million, which were instead
classified as brick & mortar sales. Such click & collect sales were classified as e-commerce sales in subsequent periods.

(6) EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) (calculated as sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise
plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses and plus the result from
impairments on financial assets) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) should
be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the consolidated statements of profit or loss,
consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS.
Since not all companies define EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) in the same way, EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) as shown in
this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA (=
reported EBITDA) as shown in the table above is unadjusted. See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

(7) Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) comprises EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) adjusted for those lease expenses and income in
accordance with IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16, and adjusted for those items which, in the
opinion and decision of the management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, are non-regularly recurring, exceptional or
unsuitable for internal control. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) is a useful performance measure.
However, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA (as
reported) should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the consolidated statements of profit
or loss, consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow statements determined in accordance
with IFRS. Since not all companies define Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) in the same way, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported)
as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

Adjusted EBITDA comprises Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) adjusted for the reversal of credit card fees and bad debt
from the ordinary course of our operational business (write-downs in connection with receivables from our customers).
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not defined as a
measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data
from the consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash
flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define Adjusted EBITDA in the same way,
Adjusted EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

Adjusted EBITDA as presented below differs from “Adjusted EBITDA” reported in our historical consolidated financial
statements.

(*) As restated.

(a) Represents consulting fees in relation to strategic projects, acquisitions and financing.

(b) Represents expenses in connection with the sale or termination of a business unit or stores, significant changes in
management structure and fundamental reorganizations. Includes severance payments and salary continuation
payments and for certain management positions, is irrespective of whether a position has been reappointed.

(c) Represents purchase price allocations that relate to the amortization of hidden reserves disclosed in connection with
business combinations.

(d) In the financial year 2017/2018, adjustments included write-downs in connection with the integration and
restructuring of our acquisitions of Bodybell in Spain and Limoni and La Gardenia in Italy. In the financial years
2017/2018 and 2018/2019, adjustments included write-downs of inventory in connection with the rejuvenation of
our brand appearance as part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy as well as the renewal of product ranges in our
own brand products. In the financial year 2019/2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
adjustments included income from the reversal of an impairment loss recognized in the prior year.

(e) Represents certain effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of government measures such as the
imposition of quarantines, stay-at-home orders, curfews and the closure of non-essential shops, the majority of our
stores were temporarily closed for periods throughout 2020. As a result, our closed stores recorded no revenue
during this period while still incurring direct costs. In the financial year 2019/2020 and the first quarter 2020/2021,
COVID-19 effects primarily related to the direct costs of the closure of our stores to the extent not borne by
governmental authorities or our landlords, including rental-related idle costs (financial year 2019/2020: €32.5 million
and first quarter 2020/2021: rental related idle costs of €7.7 million), personnel-related vacancy costs (financial year
2019/2020: €15.5 million and first quarter 2020/2021: staff-related idle costs of €3.9 million) and external staffing
costs (financial year 2019/2020: €2.8 million and first quarter 2020/2021: €0.5 million). In the financial year
2019/2020 and the first quarter 2020/2021, additional direct costs also included expenses related to the purchase
of hygiene products, cleaning costs and IT to accommodate remote working (financial year 2019/2020: €9.7 million
and first quarter 2020/2021: €1.3 million) and inventory valuation effects of €3.7 million in the financial year
2019/2020, which were offset by adjustments for government grants received (financial year 2019/2020: €2.8 million
and first quarter 2020/2021: €1.2 million). Further government grants were directly netted with personnel costs; in
case of grants that could not be directly netted, these grants were adjusted, and thus netting or partially
compensating the adjusted vacancy costs. The COVID-19 cost adjustment (i) does not add back sales for the periods
of store closures, (ii) does not reflect the impact of any increased demand for our products during periods following
the reopening of our stores following lockdowns and (iii) does not give effect to the impact of increased
e-commerce sales as a result of the lockdowns during the calendar year 2020.

(f) Represents fees charged for the use of credit cards that are classified as financial expenses in Adjusted EBITDA (as
reported). These fees are reversed in respect of Adjusted EBITDA.

(g) Represents other items that do not occur on a regular basis. In the financial year 2017/2018, other adjustments
included marketing costs of €12.4 million in connection with the rejuvenation of our brand appearance as part of our
#FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, valuation effects from the write-down of receivables amounting to €4.6 million and
integration costs of €7.4 million. In the financial year 2018/2019, other adjustments included integration and
reorganization costs of €5.6 million as well as a provision of €4.8 million for a tax claim with a former shareholder and
a potential logo claim, which were offset by income from the sale of our former headquarters in Hagen amounting to
€10.3 million. In the financial year 2019/2020, other adjustments included expenses from the optimization of our
store network amounting to €9.2 million and write-downs in connection with receivables at risk of default amounting
to €2.6 million, which were offset by compensation from our former shareholder (€5.5 million), income from the
reversal of a previously adjusted provision for legal disputes (€1.5 million), other income from legal disputes (€3.5
million) and the reversal of various provisions (€2.3 million). In the first quarter 2020/2021, other adjustments
included restructuring expenses that were not personnel-related, write-downs of receivables, impairment losses on
inventories not otherwise reported and income from the reversal of previously adjusted provisions.

(h) Represents the reversal of bad debt expenses from the ordinary course of our operational business (write-downs in
connection with receivables from our customers).

(8) Store Adjusted EBITDA comprises reported EBITDA attributable to our brick & mortar stores adjusted for those lease
expenses and income in accordance with IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16, and adjusted for
those items which, in the opinion and decision of the management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, are non-regularly
recurring, exceptional or unsuitable for internal control. Adjusted EBITDA by channel as presented in this offering
memorandum has been derived from our unaudited management accounts and does not include group overhead costs.

(9) E-commerce Adjusted EBITDA comprises reported EBITDA attributable to our e-commerce platform adjusted for those
lease expenses and income in accordance with IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16, and
adjusted for those items which, in the opinion and decision of the management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, are
non-regularly recurring, exceptional or unsuitable for internal control. Adjusted EBITDA by channel as presented in this
offering memorandum has been derived from our unaudited management accounts and does not include group
overhead costs.

(10) Inventories comprise finished goods and merchandise, raw materials, consumables and supplies, as well as advances to
suppliers for merchandise. Inventories are audited for the financial years ended September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020.


###### 37

(11) Capital expenditures relate to additions made to intangible assets (primarily relating to acquired and internally
generated software) and property, plant and equipment (mainly regarding the opening and acquisition of new stores
and investments in the design and re-design of existing stores). Capital expenditures are audited for the financial years
ended September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

(12) Free cash flow is defined as sum of net cash flow from operating activities and net cash flow from investing activities.

(13) Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures correspond to the difference of Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures,
in each case for the period indicated.

(14) Cash conversion is defined as the difference of Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA,
in each case in the period indicated.

(15) The segment reporting of the Group prepared in conformity with the provisions of IFRS 8 reflects the internal
management and reporting structure, which is based on geographical regions. For the purposes of segment reporting,
the individual countries in which we operate are allocated to the regions Germany (including Norway, Parfumdreams
and Niche Beauty), France, South-western Europe (including Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland,
Monaco and Andorra) and Eastern Europe (including Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Estonia). Service and regional holding entities are allocated to the respective segments
based on their place of business.

(16) Segment sales (net) represent, for each segment, sales generated from transactions with third parties outside the Group,
while intersegment sales represent sales generated from transactions with other segments of our Group.

(1) We define the number of orders as the number of customer orders placed in the financial year after cancelations and
backorders; an order is counted on the day we fulfill the order. These values are only for the countries in which we
operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(2) We define the number of active customers as the sum of all customers placing at least one order per financial year for
which an invoice has been issued, whereby a customer ordering multiple times under a guest account will be counted as
multiple customers. Due to a system change, active customer data for Spain is not included in financial year 2017/2018.
These values are only for the countries in which we operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(3) We calculate site visits as the number of series of page requests from the same device and source (either via websites,
internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t”
sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a mobile or
“smart” telephone)) in the respective period as recorded via the analytics tool Webtrekk. Due to technical reasons,
tracking data for Switzerland is not included for financial year 2018/2019. These values are only for the countries in which
we operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(1) We define as adjusted net senior secured indebtedness as total senior secured indebtedness after giving pro forma
effect to the Transaction as if the Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2020 and includes €600 million under the
Term Loan B Facility and €1,305 million represented by the Senior Secured Notes less as adjusted cash and cash
equivalents as set out in “Capitalization”.

(2) We define as adjusted net indebtedness as total indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the Transaction as if the
Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2020 and includes an aggregate principal amount of €600 million under the
Term Loan B Facility, €1,305 million represented by the Senior Secured Notes, €475 million represented by the Senior
PIK Notes and €2.1 million national aid loans incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic less as adjusted cash
and cash equivalents as set out in “Capitalization”.

(3) We define as adjusted cash interest expense as total interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the Transaction as
if the Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2020. Pro forma cash interest expense includes interest on the total pro
forma total indebtedness (assuming that the Senior PIK Notes paid only PIK Interest, and no Cash Interest, during the
twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020) as if such debt had been outstanding for the entire twelve months
ended December 31, 2020 as well as the commitment fees on our undrawn Revolving Credit Facility (assuming the
Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn for the entire twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020). Pro forma cash
interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be what our cash interest
expense would have actually been had the Transaction occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our
cash interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

(4) We define as adjusted total interest expense as total interest expense after giving pro forma effect to the Transaction as
if the Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2020. Pro forma total interest expense includes interest on the total pro
forma total indebtedness (including PIK Interest on the Senior PIK Notes for the twelve-month period ended December
31, 2020) as if such debt had been outstanding for the entire twelve months ended December 31, 2020, amortization of
original issue discount on the Term Loan B Facility over a three-year period, as well as the commitment fees on our
undrawn Revolving Credit Facility (assuming the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn for the entire twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2020). Pro forma total interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only
and does not purport to be what our total interest expense would have actually been had the Transaction occurred on
the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our total interest expense for any future period or our financial
condition at any future date.

(5) This presentation of Management Adjusted EBITDA is for informational purposes only. Management Adjusted EBITDA
does not represent the results we would have achieved in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our presentation of
Management Adjusted EBITDA is subject to significant uncertainties, simplifications and assumptions, and some
historical data used to develop Management Adjusted EBITDA has been derived from our unaudited management
accounts. These assumptions and management accounts data have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or
verified by any independent accounting firm, and do not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS. You
should not consider Management Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure
derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity, or as a historical performance
measure at all. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the information and adjustments set forth below. Other
companies, including those in our industry, may calculate a similarly titled financial measure differently from us, and so
the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and
_Business—We present information relating to Management Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum; certain of the_
_data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you_
_should not unduly rely on them.”_

(a) We have selected the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as the starting point for our presentation because
this represents the most recent twelve months period of trading that was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table shows a reconciliation for the periods presented of our EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) to our
Further Adjusted EBITDA for LTM December 2019 that is the basis for our Management Adjusted EBITDA. Further
Adjusted EBITDA for LTM December 2019 as presented below differs from “Adjusted EBITDA” reported in our
historical consolidated financial statements and Adjusted EBITDA presented elsewhere in this offering
memorandum due to further management adjustments made in the development of Management Adjusted EBITDA
and identified together with the consultancy function of a leading international accounting firm. The unaudited IFRS
interim consolidated financial information as of and for the three months period ended December 31, 2018 has
been retrospectively corrected in the unaudited IFRS interim consolidated financial information as of and for the
three months period ended as of December 31, 2020 due to overstated accrued expenses amounting to
€23.4 million.

(*) As restated.

(A) Represents consulting fees in relation to strategic projects, acquisitions and financing.

(B) Represents expenses in connection with the sale or termination of a business unit or stores, significant changes
in management structure and fundamental reorganizations. Includes severance payments and salary
continuation payments and for certain management positions, is irrespective of whether a position has been
reappointed.

(C) Represents purchase price allocations that relate to the amortization of hidden reserves disclosed in connection
with business combinations.

(D) In the financial year 2018/2019, adjustments included write-downs of inventory in connection with the
rejuvenation of our brand appearance as part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy as well as the renewal of
product ranges in our own brand products. In the first quarter 2019/2020, adjustments included income from
the reversal of an impairment loss of inventory recognized in the financial year 2018/2019.

(E) Represents fees charged for the use of credit cards that are classified as financial expenses in Adjusted EBITDA
(as reported). These fees are reversed in respect of Adjusted EBITDA.

(F) Represents other items that do not occur on a regular basis. In the financial year 2018/2019, other adjustments
included integration and reorganization costs of €5.6 million as well as a provision of €4.8 million for a tax claim

with a former shareholder and for a potential logo claim, which were offset by income from the sale of our
former headquarters in Hagen amounting to €10.3 million. In the first quarter 2019/2020, other adjustments
included reimbursements for tax claims and reversal of provisions.

(G) Represents the reversal of bad debt expenses from the ordinary course of our operational business (writedowns in connection with receivables from our customers).

(H) Represents the reallocation of supplier bonuses to correspond to net sales due to (i) supplier bonuses typically
arising at the end of the calendar year rather than the end of our financial year, which requires us to estimate
accrued bonuses at the end of our financial year and (ii) significant monthly fluctuations in supplier bonuses in
France.

(I) Represents the release of provisions related to loyalty points in Italy following the change of our customer
loyalty scheme in Italy at the end of the financial year 2018/2019 when all loyalty points older than 12 months
old have expired.

(J) Represents the reallocation of marketing income to correspond to marketing expenses due to the significantly
monthly fluctuations in marketing income.

(K) Represents the difference between provisions made for estimated personnel bonuses and personnel bonuses
paid.

(L) Represents expenses related to limited inhouse supply chain services, which started to be fully outsourced in
August 2018 but were maintained for a certain period after August 2018 for risk management.

(b) To analyze our net sales recovery, we compared net sales for the period from June to October 2020 with adjusted net
sales for the corresponding period in the 2019, based on unaudited monthly management accounts, resulting in a
recovery rate of 100.2%. While the period from June to October does not include our peak Christmas trading period,
the period from June to October 2020 was not affected by lockdowns in the countries where we operate except in
France, where a second lockdown started on October 30, 2020. To compensate for the two lost trading days in the
period, we made a €2 million adjustment to net sales for the period from June to October 2020 in order to present our
recovery rate without the effect of lockdowns. We believe that the net sales recovery rate of 100.2% reflects our
omnichannel capabilities and the measures we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as catch-up
effects after the first lockdown, acceleration of spending ahead of expected further lockdowns, increased disposable
incomes due to canceled summer vacations, and temporary VAT reductions in Germany.

(c) Represents a management estimate of store rent inflation, applying an assumed average rent inflation of 1.0% based on
historical store rent inflation rates to the amount of store rent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 (such
amount based on unaudited management accounts). This adjustment does not purport to represent actual store rent in
the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, or what store rent would have been in the absence of the COVID-19
pandemic. Actual store rent may have been higher or lower.

(d) Represents a management estimate of personnel cost inflation, applying an assumed average personnel cost inflation of
2.0% to the amount of personnel cost for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 (such amount based on
unaudited management accounts). This adjustment does not purport to represent actual personnel costs in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020, or what personnel costs would have been in the absence of the COVID-19
pandemic. Actual personnel costs may have been higher or lower.

(e) During the period from June to October 2020, the share of our net sales attributable to e-commerce sales was higher
than during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. While costs related to selling our products in our brick &
mortar sales are largely fixed, each e-commerce sale triggers additional packaging, delivery and fulfillment costs. We
therefore applied an adjustment representing (i) the ratio of our e-commerce delivery and distribution costs to
e-commerce net sales for the period from June to October 2020 to (ii)(x) the product of (A) our net sales for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019 as adjusted for the 100.2% recovery rate and (B) the ratio of our e-commerce sales to
overall net sales for the period from June to October 2020 minus (y) actual e-commerce sales for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019. All amounts referenced in this footnote are based on unaudited management accounts.

(f) During the period from June to October 2020, the share of our net sales attributable to e-commerce sales was higher
than during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Gross margins generated from our e-commerce business are
typically lower than those of our store business, primarily due to product mix and higher promotional activities online.
We therefore applied an adjustment representing the product of (i) (x) the product of (A) our net sales for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019 as adjusted for the 100.2% recovery rate and (B) the ratio of e-commerce sales to
overall net sales for the period from June to October 2020, less (y) actual e-commerce sales for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019 and (ii) the difference in percentage points of our e-commerce gross margin for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to our store gross margin for the same period. All amounts referenced
in this footnote are based on unaudited management accounts.

(g) During the period from June to October 2020, the share of our net sales attributable to e-commerce sales was higher
than during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Increased e-commerce sales typically require additional
performance marketing, mainly attributable to search engine advertising. We therefore applied an adjustment
representing additional marketing costs calculated by multiplying an estimated 7.8% cost of sales ratio, which is based
on our historic performance marketing cost ratio in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, to the product of
(i) our net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as adjusted for the 100.2% recovery rate and (ii) the
ratio of e-commerce sales to overall net sales for the period from June to October 2020. This adjustment does not
purport to represent what such additional search engine advertising and other costs were in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, or what such costs would have been in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual additional
search engine advertising and other costs may have been higher or lower.

(h) During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we closed 103 stores (excluding stores closed in
connection with our Store Optimization Program (“SOP”) as described below) and opened 56 new stores, resulting in a
net reduction of 47 stores. We prorated the sales attributable to the 103 closed stores in their last full year of operation
to reflect sales attributable to the 47 net closed stores and applied a transfer rate of 39% based on the average sales
transfer assumption used in our SOP across store clusters as a proxy for the amount of sales that would be transferred to
other stores or our e-commerce channel. We then applied an average gross margin representing the gross margin for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 of stores in Southern Europe where most store closings took place. This
gross margin for brick & mortar stores is higher than our e-commerce gross margin. The adjustment reflects the resulting
gross profit reduced by the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the 103 closed stores prorated to reflect 47 net closed
stores. As a result, the adjustment does not take into account (i) additional staff and other incremental costs in the
remaining store network resulting from the transfer of sales from closed stores, (ii) the total effect of closing 103 stores
and associated sales transfers and (iii) the actual contribution to Adjusted EBITDA of the 56 new stores. This adjustment
does not purport to represent any actual transfer of sales from our closed stores to other stores or our e-commerce
channel.

(i) In the summer of 2020, we began to reevaluate our store network in order to identify where we have a high number of
stores within the same catchment area. We have created our SOP to actively manage and rebalance the density of our
store network taking into account changing customer behavior towards online retailing that was further accelerated by
the COVID-19 pandemic. In connection with our SOP, we intend to close approximately 500 stores, optimize our staffing
levels and re-negotiate leases with landlords in respect of stores that will remain open. See “Business—Strategy—
_Complement accelerating e-commerce channel with Store Optimization Program”. Run rate adjustments for our SOP_
represent management’s estimates of run rate effects that were developed with a leading global consulting firm, are
based on Further Adjusted EBITDA for LTM December 2019, involve significant assumptions and cannot be audited,
reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. These run rate adjustments do not include implementation
costs of the measures described. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive
risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the adjustments. As a
result, while we believe that these run rate adjustments and potential cost savings are reasonable estimates, the actual
results of our SOP in any given period may differ from those estimated herein or may not materialize at all.

(j) Represents management’s estimate of the potential improvement in Adjusted EBITDA from our SOP based on the
EBITDA effect of estimated sales transfers from closing stores to nearby stores that remain open and our e-commerce
platform. We have applied the gross margin of the closed stores to the sales estimated to transfer to other, nearby stores
(net of estimated additional costs in the remaining network resulting from such sales transfer) and the country-specific
EBITDA margin of e-commerce sales to the sales estimated to transfer to our e-commerce platform. The estimated sales
transfer rates are based on a detailed, bottom-up, store-by-store level analysis developed by us together with a leading
global consulting firm, involve significant assumptions and estimates and are subject to inherent uncertainties. Actual
sale transfers from our closed stores, if any, could be lower, incremental costs could be higher and cost savings smaller
or delayed compared to management’s estimates. As a consequence, actual Adjusted EBITDA benefits could be smaller,
develop later or not materialize at all. The run rate effect does not account for costs associated with our targeted store
closures. In connection with our targeted store closures, we have identified estimated one-off cash requirements of
approximately €39 million comprised of costs of €116 million related to severance costs, break costs for leases and store
deconstruction costs and inventory write-offs amounting to €47 million (estimated using country-specific inventory
recovery rates of 50-90% of the applicable purchase price excluding any supplier bonuses), partially offset by effects of
€124 million related to inventory reduction.

(k) Represents management’s estimate of potential Adjusted EBITDA improvements based on optimizing staffing levels in
stores that remain open, based on an internal benchmarking exercise developed by us together with a leading global
consulting firm. This run rate effect is based on various significant assumptions and estimates developed by
management and is subject to inherent uncertainties. Such efficiency improvements could be lower or not materialize at
all. The run rate effect does not account for costs associated with the staff level optimization. In connection with the
optimization of staff levels in stores that remain open, we have identified estimated one-off cash requirements of
approximately €14 million related to severance costs.

(l) Represents management’s estimate of potential Adjusted EBITDA improvements from rent reductions through
renegotiating leases with landlords of stores that will not be closed. This run rate effect is based on various significant
assumptions and estimates developed by us together with a leading global consulting firm and is subject to inherent
uncertainties. Such rent reductions could be lower or not materialize at all.

(m) Represents management’s estimate of potential Adjusted EBITDA improvements from cost savings related to
#ForwardOrganization, a program aimed at standardizing, harmonizing and centralizing aspects of our internal
functions. See “Business—Strategy—Launch #ForwardOrganization in line with digital first strategy”. The estimated cost
savings involve significant assumptions and estimates and are subject to inherent uncertainties. Such efficiency
improvements could be lower or not materialize at all. This run rate effect does not account for costs associated with
#ForwardOrganization. In connection with #ForwardOrganization, we have identified estimated one-off cash
requirements of approximately €25 million related to severance costs.

(n) Represents the run rate effect of a sales force efficiency program in Germany that was implemented in spring 2020. This
run rate effect does not account for associated costs such as severance costs.

_as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._
_See “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and Business

_The outbreak of the coronavirus has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material impact on our business_
_and results of operations and cash flows._

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the recent novel coronavirus and the
respiratory disease that it causes (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic”) and
governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Key
aspects of these measures included restrictions on travel and the closure of national borders, as well as the
imposition of quarantines, stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, curfews, limitations on building occupancies
and other social distancing measures. A significant feature of these measures was the order for non-essential
shops to temporarily close. For example, the German government announced strict social distancing measures
in March 2020, banning public gatherings of more than two people and ordering non-essential shops to shut.
The lockdown was lifted in April 2020, though a second lockdown was imposed from December 16, 2020 and
was recently extended generally to April 18, 2021. In France, a similar lockdown was imposed from March 2020
to May 2020 followed by a second lockdown from October 2020 to November 2020. On January 14, 2021, the
French government announced new measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a stricter
curfew that was extended to the entire country. On January 31, 2021, France closed its borders to all non-EU
countries, except for hauliers, and as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the curfew remains in place.
From midnight on March 19, 2021, a further lockdown took effect in certain regions of France including in Paris
and its surrounding region. Other countries across Europe where we operate including Italy and Spain have
imposed similar restrictions. In Poland, the government announced a new nationwide lockdown starting on
March 20, 2021 until at least April 9, 2021. In addition, in the Netherlands, a national lockdown and curfew is
currently slated to remain in place until April 20, 2021.

These measures led to the temporary closure of the majority of our stores for periods throughout 2020
and a significant number of our stores in 2021 to date, and as a result, significantly and negatively affected our
business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, by the beginning of April 2020, nearly all
of our stores were closed. We have been and expect to continue to be adversely affected by governmental
efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the majority of our stores slowly re-opened after the end
of April 2020 dependent on the countries where they are located, some stores remained closed or closed
again during subsequent lockdowns or are operating with reduced workforces and shortened opening hours.
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the majority of our stores in Germany and Poland and slightly
more than half of our stores in France remain closed. Our stores in the Netherlands have recently reopened on
a by-appointment basis. As a result, our store traffic and sales have not reached pre-lockdown levels. For
example, in our six core countries as of December 31, 2020, 53.7% of our stores were open. The drop in
customer footfall in many locations led to significantly lower brick & mortar sales, and in the periods following
the lockdown, extended hygiene measures (such as requirements to provide disinfectants, wear masks and
limits on the number of customers in our stores) had to be implemented in stores for the health and safety of
our customers and employees, which also resulted in lower footfall. Despite the decrease in sales, fixed costs,
particularly in the form of personnel and rental expenses, have not fallen to the same extent, resulting in
significant cash consumption during periods of lockdown, including the current store closures, which extend
beyond the period envisaged in our original planning assumptions for this financial year. Overall, the
COVID-19 pandemic mainly contributed to a decline of our brick & mortar sales by 15.8% in financial year
2019/2020 compared to the financial year 2018/2019 and 28.8% in the first quarter of 2020/2021 compared to
the first quarter of the financial year 2019/2020.

The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial
condition is uncertain and will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted. These future
developments include, but are not limited to the duration, spread, severity and impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, the possibility and/or impact of additional waves of infections in the countries where we operate,

###### 45


-----

the timing and ability of vaccinations and other treatments to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and suppliers, the duration of future declarations of emergency and
any remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by the governments of the countries where we operate
and the European Union and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We are
also unable to predict the extent, implementation and effectiveness of any government-funded benefit
programs and stimulus packages on our employment levels, demand for our products or other aspects of our
business.

The COVID-19 pandemic could have further material adverse effects on our business, results of
operations and financial condition if:

    - the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic result in sustained deterioration in
the economic environment in the regions in which we operate;

    - as a result of continuing and future COVID-19 outbreaks or other deterioration in public health in
the regions in which we operate, governments approve new emergency measures which result in
us having to reclose our physical stores, restrictions on deliveries of purchases from e-commerce
platform or disruptions in our supply chains;

    - continued requirements for social distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further
spread of COVID-19 impacts the operation and appeal of our stores, as customers who dislike
wearing face coverings or observing social distancing guidance may choose to shop online or not
shop at all;

    - any customers or employees contract COVID-19, which could result in a temporary closure of our
stores or other facilities for cleaning, staff shortages or customers becoming reluctant to visit our
stores;

    - governments in the regions where we operate continue to impose travel restrictions, including
temporary suspension of flight and other modes of travel;

    - political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are
adverse to our business, such as governmental actions or proposed actions limiting retail
operations or delivery services, which may prevent us from opening our physical stores or online
services or result in material increases in our costs in our effort to comply with such laws and
regulations;

    - as a result of unemployment or reduced income or increased costs ensuing from the COVID-19
pandemic, consumers respond by decreasing their spending or changing their long-term
behavior;

    - consumers continue spending more time at home and not socializing or meeting others in
person, which in turn negatively affects the demand for selective beauty and personal care
products;

    - we are unable to maintain staffing at the levels necessary to operate our business due to the
continued spread or increased virulence of COVID-19 or related coronavirus strains or resultant
health complications, causing employees to be unable or unwilling to work;

    - adverse capital and credit market conditions increase our cost of capital or affect our ability to
raise capital, and our cash generation is not sufficient to sustain our needs;

    - tax rates are increased to fund the cost of various government initiatives initiated in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic; or

    - we suffer cyber-security incidents or data breaches as a result of an increase in the number or
severity of cyber-attacks, or increased vulnerability while a larger proportion of our employees
work remotely.

While we have taken steps to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are uncertainties
associated with changes to our operational practices and whether they will be successful in mitigating the
targeted risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, or cause other adverse effects to our business, financial condition
and results of operations due to their unforeseen impact on our ability to operate our business in the future. If,
among other factors, the adverse impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic were to cause our results of
operations or cash flows to continue to be worse than anticipated or otherwise adversely impact certain of our

assets, such as our inventories, we could conclude in future periods that additional provisions or other liabilities
are required, which could have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Any such future provisions or liabilities could be significant. We are also subject to the risks of other
pandemics or outbreaks occurring in the future, which may present a similar risk to COVID-19. To the extent
the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future outbreak adversely affects our business, financial condition and
results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks
described in this “Risk Factors” section, including, but not limited to “—We are exposed to changes in general
_economic and political conditions, in particular in our six core countries”, “—Our sales, liquidity and inventory_
_levels fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis”, “—We largely depend upon a limited number of third parties_
_for the supply of products that we sell”, “—We are subject to risks in connection with the quality and timely_
_delivery of our own brand products and our relationship with the manufacturers of such products”, “—We may be_
_unable to successfully implement our store investment strategy or our investments into new geographical_
_markets and/or product areas”, “—We face certain risks in connection with past and future acquisitions and joint_
_ventures, including failure to effectively integrate the businesses and achieve expected synergies as well as_
_unexpected liabilities.”, “—Our strategy and reorganization measures may not achieve the expected results”,_
_“—Negotiating, terminating or extending store leases may be difficult or costly, which could negatively impact_
_our competitive position, growth strategy and profitability”, “—We may be unable to effectively manage our costs_
_and inventories”, “—We depend on a limited number of facilities and logistic partners for the distribution of the_
_products that we sell to our stores and could experience interruptions or delays in the distribution and delivery_
_of the products that we sell”, “—We are exposed to the risk of rising labor costs, as well as work stoppages, strikes_
_or other collective actions”, and “—Our insurance coverage could prove inadequate”._

_There is material uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern._

Our audited financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020, as well as the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were prepared
on a going concern basis. The going concern basis contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as such. However, given that current store closures
extend beyond the periods envisaged in our original planning assumptions for this financial year, there are
implementation risks associated with our transformation program and the COVID-19 situation continues to
evolve, there exists a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. While the total amount (net book value) outstanding under our
Existing Senior Secured Notes, our Existing Senior Notes, and our Existing Senior Secured Facilities amounted
to €2,457.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and those debt facilities mature in 2022 and 2023, we intend to
repay our Existing Senior Secured Notes, our Existing Senior Notes and our Existing Senior Secured Facilities
as part of the Transaction. The auditor’s report in relation to the audited consolidated financial statements for
the financial year 2019/2020 contains a paragraph on material uncertainty in relation to going concern. In
addition, the notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for the first quarter
2020/2021 include a note on material uncertainty related to a going concern risk for the Group.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on our business,
primarily due to the temporary closure of the majority of our brick & mortar stores for periods throughout 2020.
See “—Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and Business—The outbreak of the coronavirus has had, and is
_likely to continue to have, a material impact on our business and results of operations.” Our ability to forecast_
our pace of recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the eventual levels to which our results of
operations will return as well as our cash flows are dependent on the re-opening of our stores, any future
government-imposed restrictions or lockdowns in the countries where we operate that result in further store
closures as well as developments that could offset the effects of store closures such as the continued shift
towards online retailing as well as the optimization of our store network through our Store Optimization
Program (“SOP”).

If one or more of our assumptions in making our assessment to report as a going concern are found to
be incorrect, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. For additional information, see Note 2 to our
audited financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020 and the auditor’s report. If we are unable to
continue as a going concern, we would have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at
which those assets are carried on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and it is likely that investors will lose a
part or all of their investment in the Notes.

_We are exposed to changes in general economic and political conditions, in particular in our six core countries._

We are exposed to changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, in
particular, our six core countries where we derive the majority of our sales, accounting for 90.7% of sales in

financial year 2019/2020. These economic conditions include, among others, levels of employment, inflation or
deflation, real disposable income, interest rates, taxation, currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer
credit, levels of consumer debt, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions and
related willingness or ability to spend, all of which are beyond our control.

The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union (“Brexit”), following a formal notification to
the European Council of its intention to leave the European Union. The United Kingdom and the European
Union agreed a trade and cooperation agreement (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”), which took
provisional effect from January 1, 2021 (provisional application has since been extended to April 30, 2021).
Brexit could result in adverse economic effects across the United Kingdom and Europe, and may continue to
be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations or otherwise adversely
affect trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal,
legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. The nature of the future relationship between the
United Kingdom and European Union remains unclear, as are the macroeconomic effects of the United
Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.

Future negative economic developments in the global economy, the Eurozone or the countries in
which we operate could have an adverse impact on the European selective beauty market in general or in the
countries in which we operate. In addition, market disruptions due to natural disasters, health hazards including
the COVID-19 pandemic or other major events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels.
As a result, consumers may change their purchasing habits and buy more affordable products than those on
offer in the premium beauty market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position.

Adverse economic developments may lead to lower overall sales of the products that we offer or
require us to change our product mix in ways that impact our overall profitability or result in slower inventory
turnover and higher markdowns on inventory. In addition, changes in economic conditions may lead to higher
costs associated with our operations, such as longer payment terms for customers, changes to supplier credit
terms and the need to restructure or implement cost-saving measures. Any such adverse economic
developments could materially negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial position

Geopolitical tensions could negatively affect the demand for our products, including current tensions
between Western countries and Russia or China, if they further deteriorate. Furthermore, if the European
Monetary Union ceased to exist or one or more countries were to leave the European Monetary Union, future
economic development and consumer spending in general could be adversely affected, which could in turn
have a material adverse impact on the European premium beauty market and on our business, results of
operations and financial position.

_We may fail to anticipate, identify or respond adequately to changing consumer tastes or new trends._

Our growth and results of operations depend on our ability (and the ability of our suppliers) to
anticipate, gauge and react to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for specific beauty
products. We may fail to recognize relevant trends or translate market trends into appropriate and saleable
products that are competitively priced.

Market trends and demand for retail products generally and, in particular, for our beauty and personal
care products, are difficult to predict accurately and can change rapidly due to a number of factors, most of
which are beyond our control, including, among others, temporary fashion trends, trends relating to premium
and low-cost products, consumer spending and demographics. In addition, the success of our business
depends on brand and industry perceptions as well as shopping habits of our customers.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced and are continuing to experience shifts in the mix of
products purchased by our customers, which we attribute to the hygiene measures implemented to reduce the
spread of COVID-19 such as the widespread wearing of masks, the increased prevalence of working from
home and the lack of opportunities for in person social interactions. For example, we experienced a higher
share of sales from skin and body care while sales attributable to make-up decreased. If we misjudge either the
demand for the products and services, or our customers’ purchasing habits and preferences, we may be faced
with lower sales and excess inventories. As a result, we may be required to increase our promotional activities
or mark down the price of unsold inventories and as a result face reduced liquidity levels and higher working
capital requirements.

Any such failure to anticipate, identify or respond adequately to changing consumer tastes and
preferences in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and brand image, our
results of operations and financial position.

###### 48

_We may fail to adapt or respond appropriately to changing customer behavior including the shift towards_
_online retailing._

The internet, including the dissemination of information via social media, is becoming increasingly
important and is changing the role of brick & mortar retail. As a result, we continuously evaluate our offerings
and the way we communicate with our customers. For example, we have observed that footfall in the brick &
mortar retail business has been decreasing in recent years due to changes in shopping behavior. In particular,
there has been a diversion of sales from brick & mortar stores due to continuous increases in the proportion of
sales through e-commerce channels. E-commerce also enables consumers to quickly compare different online
suppliers and their prices and increases the risk that we may lose sales to other e-commerce retailers. If we fail
to adapt our offerings and the way we communicate with our customers to meet such trends then this could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to e-commerce. As a result of the
restrictions put in place by governments to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, many brick & mortar retailers,
including us, have been forced to shut their physical stores temporarily or permanently and have shifted their
business online, focusing more on their online sales and online presence. This has led customers to
increasingly shop online. If more brick & mortar retailers switch their focus to online retailing, if other
e-commerce sites enter the market or if existing e-commerce sites expand their online presence, we may be
faced with more competition, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position. See also “—The outbreak of the Coronavirus has had, and is likely to continue
_to have, a material impact on our business and results of operations.”_

_Our sales, liquidity and inventory levels fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis._

We experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in our sales. Our most important sales period is the
seven- to eight-week period leading to Christmas (including Singles Day and Black Friday) and over the New
Year. Other sales periods that are important to us are those around Valentine’s Day, Easter, Black Friday,
Single’s Day, Mother’s Day and Epiphany (in some countries). The uplift in sales around our most important
trading periods is often followed by a period of price markdowns.

Any decrease in sales during peak selling periods, in particular during the Christmas season, could
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial position for the entire
financial year. For example, unusually adverse weather conditions, a significant interruption in the supply of
products (whether attributable to suppliers, the supply chain or logistics or other product delivery problems),
or a sharp decline in consumer traffic in our store network during peak seasons, could materially affect sales
during the relevant financial year. In 2020, a second wave of lockdowns were implemented by governments in
Germany, France and certain of our other core countries during the Christmas season as a result of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our stores in Germany and the Netherlands were closed from midDecember, while partial lockdowns were in place in our other core countries, which contributed to a 9.3%
decrease in total Group sales in the first quarter 2020/2021 as compared to the first quarter 2019/2020. In
addition, as we could only guarantee delivery of e-commerce orders by Christmas if such orders were placed
several days in advance of December 24, the decrease in brick & mortar store sales was only partially
compensated by e-commerce sales.

Seasonal fluctuations also have a significant impact on our working capital, liquidity levels and
inventory. We incur additional expenses in the preparation for the increased demand we typically expect
leading up to, and around, the Christmas season and other peak selling periods and must carry a significant
amount of inventory before such periods, which is also reflected in our liquidity (with a certain time lag due to
the payment terms that we have agreed with our suppliers). This trend typically results in peak liquidity at the
end of the calendar year, followed by significant outflows in the following months as payments for the
Christmas period inventory and VAT on peak sales become due. Our cash position at December 30, 2020 also
benefitted from deferred payments to tax authorities, landlords and other business partners.

If sales during our peak selling periods are significantly lower than expected, we may be unable to
adjust our expenses in a timely manner and may be faced with excess inventory and be forced to rely on higher
than usual price markdowns, promotional sales to dispose of excess inventory or inventory write-offs, thus
affecting our working capital and liquidity. Higher levels of inventory would also lead to us ordering fewer
goods in subsequent periods, which would reduce bargaining leverage with our suppliers. Conversely, if we
purchase insufficient quantities of products that sell well during peak selling periods, we may not have an
adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand and may fail to maximize our sales opportunities. Any
such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

_We face competition in the markets in which we operate and such competition may intensify further._

We operate in the competitive European beauty and personal care market, and, within this market, we
focus on the premium beauty market. We compete primarily with other specialist retailers with brick & mortar
stores or e-commerce activities, including perfumery chains, independent perfumeries, the perfumery
departments of selected (typically high-end) department stores, retailers selling products under their own
labels, duty-free shops, travel retail shops, pharmacies and para-pharmacies (which increasingly focus on skin
care and natural cosmetics) as well as drugstores, hypermarkets and pure online retailers, online beauty selling
platforms or certain of our suppliers who sell directly to consumers through their own brick & mortar stores or
online shops, (so-called “mono-brand stores”). While many of these competitors currently compete with us only
in certain segments of the beauty and personal care market, they may extend their offerings to compete with us
more broadly in the future. For example, drugstores, which currently mostly offer mass beauty and personal
care products, could increase their range of selective products and large non-selective online retailers may be
able to leverage their significant market presence, logistic infrastructure and cross-selling opportunities to
increase their presence in the beauty and personal care market.

Some of our competitors (including online retailers and other direct sellers) have in recent years
invested in their product offering and services on a large scale and may further increase their investment in
order to improve their competitive position and market share. Drugstores in the low-price segment could also
expand their product ranges to include selective products, increasing the competitive pressure we face. Such
increased competition could place pressure on our sales, pricing strategy, margins and profitability. Industry
consolidation, including by way of mergers and acquisitions, or new competitors that may enter the European
beauty and personal care market (and in particular the European premium beauty market) or existing
competitors which may expand into other European countries in which they are not yet present but in which we
operate, may also lead to increased competition and cause our market position to deteriorate, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

Such consolidation could also give our competitors increased negotiating leverage with suppliers and
greater marketing resources, allowing them to compete more effectively with us. We also face the risk of new
competitors offering cheaper imitations of original fragrances or focusing on the entry price sales directed at
younger age groups, thus attracting some of our existing or potential customers.

Some of our competitors’ greater market presence in one or more of the countries in which we
operate and strong brands may be perceived by consumers as offering higher quality products and services
than we offer or the same quality of products and services at more attractive prices. Certain competitors may
also be able to react more swiftly to changes in market conditions or trends or may be able to utilize their
market presence, strong brand or other advantages when operating in new or changing markets. They may
also be willing to accept lower prices or higher costs than we are prepared to accept in order to win market
share. The adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing, intensive promotional activities and markdown
strategies, or other similar actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, results of
operations and financial position. In certain regional markets, low-cost competitors offering products at
discount prices have in recent years gained substantial weight and continue to put pressure on our business.

In addition, we face the risk of increased competition from the so-called “grey market,” i.e., the sale of
selective beauty products through channels other than the official channels explicitly allowed by the
manufacturers as part of their selective distribution system. These in include, for example, (i) selective products
that are regularly imported into the EU or sold by distribution partners outside the selective distribution system
or in violation of distribution contracts and (ii) selective products that are sold more cheaply in emerging or
developing markets which are reimported into established markets at lower prices. These products are
typically offered at discounted prices that can be substantially lower than those of the selective distributors and
could increasingly undermine the selective distribution channel on which our business model is partially based.
These products can appear first in online/mobile searches for a particular product, for example through online
price comparison tools as well as through listings by large non-selective retailers. We also face increased
competition from grey market products for our brick & mortar business, especially when drugstores and
discounters expand their selective offerings and source selective products from the grey market. These types
of offerings sometimes also extend to counterfeit products.

If we are unable to compete effectively in our marketplace, our business, results of operations and
financial position could be materially adversely affected.

_The basis of our business model could be restricted or eliminated._

The majority of our sales are generated in the premium beauty market and there, partially through the
selective beauty distribution channel, which requires compliance with specific criteria and the formal approval
of a supplier before a retailer can carry a selective product, as opposed to the mass distribution channel.

###### 50


-----

Selective distribution currently benefits from a specific legal framework provided by Art. 101 (1) Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), and a so-called “block exemption”, which is scheduled to expire
in May 2022. The European Commission plans to issue a revised version of the regulation providing for the
“block exemption” and has launched a public consultation on possible amendments. As a result, there can be
no assurances that existing legal framework applicable to the selective beauty distribution channel will remain
unchanged. Any change in the structure of the selective beauty market or the legal framework to which it is
subject as a result of changes in laws or court decisions could result in increased compliance costs, increased
competition or require a change to our business model, which in turn could materially adversely affect our
competitive position and our sales, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial position. See “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We may be adversely affected by
_changes in antitrust and competition laws and regulations, in particular with respect to selective distribution_
_contracts” below._

_The strength of the “Douglas” brand, the “Nocibé” brand, our own brand products or the brand products of_
_our suppliers may deteriorate._

Our success depends, to a large extent, on the strength and reputation of, and value associated with,
the “Douglas” brand, the “Nocibé” brand and our other brands, for example those relating to our own brand
products and other smaller perfumeries brands owned by us, as well as the brands of our suppliers of selective
or exclusive products.

Such brand reputation can be negatively affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our
control. These factors include, among others, unsuccessful or insufficient marketing and merchandising efforts,
inability to adequately respond to consumer tastes and preferences or deterioration of the public image or
reputation of a brand as a result of unfavorable publicity concerning our Group, the products that we sell or
services we provide, our stores, our personnel or other negative publicity. With respect to premium products
from third-party brands, which accounted for a vast majority of our sales in the most recent financial year, we
are dependent on our suppliers’ investments in marketing and promotion of their brands.

Primarily in France under the Nocibé brand, we have stores that operate through franchisees. The
level of influence over our franchisees is limited. Our franchisees in France typically benefit from supplier
conditions negotiated by us, have their own purchase processes with suppliers, and purchase certain own
brand products and exclusive products from us directly. Franchisees may not have the business acumen or
financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may
not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our brand image and reputation may suffer
materially and our sales could decline if our franchisees do not operate according to external or internal
standards or do not operate successfully. Disputes with franchisees could also damage our brand reputation
and/or our relationships with the broader franchisee group.

Furthermore, any customer complaints, breach or perceived breach of relevant laws, regulations,
permits or licenses relating to the beauty, cosmetic or other health-related products sold by us, or failure to
achieve or maintain particular standards by us or our suppliers (including those of our own brand products or
any of our franchised stores) could also negatively affect our key brands and affect the reputation of our other
products, which could damage our customer relationships and lead to a decline in our sales.

Any such deterioration of the strength of our brands and products or the brand products of our
suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

_We largely depend upon a limited number of third parties for the supply of products that we sell._

We source our products from a variety of different suppliers, for example, in Germany, less than 55%
of purchasing volume related to products sourced from our top five suppliers in the financial year 2019/2020.

Our supply chain is susceptible to various risks, including failure by our suppliers to deliver products
due to operational or production disruptions, financial problems, labor issues, product quality issues, lack of
raw material or other reasons. If one or more suppliers were to fail to deliver the products to us of adequate
quality in time or at all, or if we fail to acquire, maintain or strengthen relationships with our suppliers, in
particular with respect to premium products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of products
may be limited and may become insufficient to meet demand. There can be no assurance that additional or
alternative suppliers will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, in such
cases, we might need to make changes to our supply chain and enter into other business arrangements in
order to ensure supply of quality products in a timely manner, which could result in additional costs and
temporary supply shortages or disruptions. Furthermore, any resulting prolonged negative impact on the
quality of the products or services supplied to us could materially adversely affect our reputation and business.

###### 51


-----

The disruptions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in countries where our suppliers are located
may result in a slow-down of their production or logistics activities. For example, we have and may again face
supply shortages from suppliers who divert their production facilities to focus on products dealing with the
COVID-19 pandemic such as fragrance suppliers who start producing disinfectant products. Similarly, we have
and may again face supply shortages from suppliers who have central or large warehouses which may be
closed due to pandemic area restrictions or COVID-19 cases among their operational teams. In addition, the
flow of goods between countries may be impacted by the restrictions imposed on cross border trade. As a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced increasing sea freight rates for products within our
supply chain that are made in Asia. An outbreak of COVID-19 could also occur at any time among our
employees or those of our logistics service providers, which could lead to the implementation of additional
hygiene procedures, including complete lockdowns of our logistics facilities or warehouses. These disruptions,
while difficult to predict given changing circumstances, may cause a disruption to our supply chain, which may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. See also “—The
_outbreak of the Coronavirus has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material impact on our business and_
_results of operations.”_

Many of our largest suppliers negotiate their supply terms with us across multiple brands and, in
particular in Eastern Europe, local distributors generally negotiate with us on behalf of various manufacturers.
Consequently, our supply terms for such brands and products may deteriorate in the future due to the
increased bargaining power of such suppliers and distributors. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with
our existing suppliers and local distributors, or fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with
additional or new suppliers, our ability to source a sufficient amount and variety of products and our ability to
obtain such products on terms acceptable to us may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our
competitive position.

We are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure the quality and quantity of the premium products
we offer, and we rely on them to provide supplier bonuses, advertising grants and pricing terms that make the
offering of their respective brands commercially worthwhile for us, all of which could be negatively affected in
case of deterioration or termination of a relationship with a supplier. In addition, we rely on suppliers to
provide market development funds (i.e., funds made available by the brand manufacturers to distributors like
us to help sell their products and create local brand awareness). Such market development funds are typically
very significant, and a supplier’s decision to discontinue to use our marketing channels, and therefore the
withdrawal of such funds, could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Moreover, if we
fail to comply with terms of the supply agreements, we could face penalties, potential termination of a contract
for cause, or a supplier not renewing our contract at the end of its term. In addition, we cannot eliminate the
risk of default by any of our major suppliers under the terms of our agreements with them.

Our inability to acquire products on terms and conditions acceptable to us in the future or at all, the
loss of any of our largest suppliers or several smaller suppliers, any changes in exclusivity arrangements with
one of our key suppliers or delays or a significant disruption to the supply chain could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial position and a negative impact on our competitive
position.

_We are subject to risks in connection with the quality and timely delivery of our own brand products and our_
_relationship with the manufacturers of such products._

A portion of our sales relate to our own brand products, which we acquire from diverse suppliers
mainly in Europe and Asia. These suppliers generally also manufacture products for our competitors and their
suppliers. Our agreements with the manufacturers of our own brand products, which set forth the production
and delivery of own brand products, are typically based on an order-by-order concept for each own brand
product or product line rather than long-term supply agreements and may typically be terminated with
six-months’ notice. In case an agreement with an own brand product manufacturer is terminated, there can be
no assurance that we will find other manufacturers that will be able to produce comparable replacement
products for us at competitive prices or at all. In addition, we typically do not own the recipes to these
products, and it cannot be excluded that the manufacturers may sell the same products to other retailers, which
may offer them under a different brand and packaging. If those products were sold by other retailers under a
different brand and packaging at a lower price, it could reduce our sales of the relevant products, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Since we only have limited control over manufacturers of our own brand products, there is no
guarantee that these products will continue to meet our specifications. Furthermore, any breach or perceived
breach of relevant laws, regulations, permits or licenses relating to the own brand products sold by us, or
failure to achieve or maintain particular standards could also lead to adverse publicity, which could materially
adversely affect the reputation of our own brands, as well as the “Douglas” and “Nocibé” brands, damage our
customer relationships and lead to a decline in our sales.

###### 52


-----

As we are the “responsible person” for our own brand products within the context of the applicable
European regulations on product safety applicable to cosmetics, any quality defect could lead (on the basis of
EU law or similar applicable national laws) to substantial customer claims, administrative or criminal
proceedings, penalties or similar. See also “—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We are subject to numerous laws
_and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and may be adversely affected by changes in_
_legislation and regulation.” We could also face damage to our own brands’ reputation._

In addition, if the manufacturing, delivery, sources or supply chain management processes relating to
our own brand products are disrupted for a variety of reasons, we may be delayed in restoring our inventory of
the affected own brand products and we may experience a significant increase in our cost of sales.

Any of these factors relating to own brand products could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial position.

_We face risks in connection with product safety and product liability._

We are a distributor of cosmetics and other products. We do not manufacture the products that we
sell and thus depend on third parties to ensure that such products comply with applicable quality standards.

At the same time, we qualify as a “producer” of certain cosmetic and other products because (i) we sell
our “Douglas Brand” products, which are manufactured by third parties, under our own brands and (ii) import
certain products from outside the EU. Producers and distributors who place products on the market in the
European Union must ensure that their products comply with general safety requirements as implemented in
individual European countries. Producers must also provide consumers with sufficient disclosure or warnings,
such that consumers are able to assess the safety of a product, particularly when any danger it might pose is
not obvious. Producers must also adopt necessary measures to avoid potential harm to consumers, for
example, by withdrawing unsafe products from the market, or recalling dangerous products that have already
been supplied to customers. We have in the past recalled products and may have to do so in the future.
Distributors are generally required to assist with ensuring compliance with the safety requirements, for
example by monitoring the safety of products placed on the market and by immediately informing the
competent authorities of the Member States if they know or should have known that a product that they have
placed on the market poses risks to the consumer. Any failure by us to comply with applicable product safety
regulation through the sale of unsafe products, including through our marketplace, could result in damages,
fines or reputational damage, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position.

Any failure by us to comply with applicable product safety regulation through the sale of unsafe
products, including through our marketplace, could result in damages, fines or reputational damage, which in
turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

If a product that we supply, including via our marketplace, is defective and therefore causes damage
to the property or health of our customers or third parties, we may be liable under product liability legislation.
This does generally only apply to those cases, however, in which we qualify as a producer of the defective
product, as distributors are only liable in exceptional cases. In cases where we qualify as a producer, we are
liable jointly and severally together with the manufacturer or other liable persons, but national laws may
contain rights of contribution or recourse.

_Our e-commerce platform is subject to several risks including regarding the functioning of hardware and_
_software, customer acceptance, integration with our brick & mortar stores._

Our omnichannel offerings have become increasingly important, as we also sell products via our
e-commerce platform and our marketplace in addition to our brick & mortar sales, and our success is, among
other factors, dependent on our ability to maintain attractive online shops, continue to expand our online and
mobile presence, generate e-commerce traffic and convert this traffic into sales. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, e-commerce sales accounted for 32.3% of total sales, as compared to 67.3% for brick &
mortar sales (referred to as store sales in the financial statements). The remainder is related to other sales (e.g.
wholesale).

Our e-commerce operations are subject to a number of risks, including reliance on third parties for
computer hardware, software, services and support, the need to keep up with rapid technological change and
the implementation of new systems and platforms, as well as the risk that our e-commerce platform or any of
our online shops may become unstable, unavailable or subject to cyber-attacks or that customer data may be
misappropriated.

###### 53


-----

In addition, in October 2019 in Germany, we launched our beauty marketplace where we list products
from third party suppliers and brands and set their prices on our online shop. If a customer orders a product,
we process the payment and then in turn order that product from the relevant third-party partner. Products are
then delivered directly by our partners to the end customer. While our partners are solely responsible for the
sourcing and supply of products, the marketplace is fully integrated into our existing e-commerce framework.
Although the information about the delivery from a partner is displayed on the product detail page and in the
basket, customers may perceive that they are purchasing products directly from us. As a result, any issues
related to product quality, timing of deliveries or similar matters could adversely affect our brand and
reputation among our customers.

We also face the risk that customers find the websites of our online shops difficult to use. Customers
may also be unwilling to share personal information online or via our mobile applications, less willing to use the
sites than we expect, or not confident that the sites are secure. Furthermore, unexpected costs in connection
with the further development of our e-commerce platform and/or our online shops may arise. We may face
difficulties in further coordinating our e-commerce platform and our brick & mortar store network, particularly
in managing the interface between in-store merchandising and online shopping, which may result in
complications for both our e-commerce and cross-channel customers.

We may also be held liable for online content, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns and
may be unable to honor our usual delivery terms in case of an unexpected or a higher than expected spike in
customer orders or for other reasons which may cause negative reputational consequences. Similarly, negative
online reviews from dissatisfied customers may deter other potential customers from using our e-commerce
platform and may also affect our brands’ reputation and sales in our brick & mortar stores.

We use e-mail, app push notifications and newer media channels, including social media channels
such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and our own beauty blog “beautystories” (the German
version of which is available under http://blog.douglas.de) to promote our products or marketing messages.
The delivery of such e-mails, app push notifications and messages via social media channels may fail or be
delayed for technical reasons, customers may not take note of them, or they may be marked as “spam” or
“junk.” Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of e-mails or other
messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing
additional requirements on us in connection with them, could impair our ability to communicate with our
customers using e-mail or other means. In addition, certain customers may be dissatisfied when exposed to too
many advertising campaigns or newsletters and to what they may consider to be e-mail or text message
“flooding.”

Our failure to respond appropriately to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our sales (in
particular, our e-commerce sales) as well as damage our reputation and brands, especially since e-commerce is
a significant part of our growth strategy. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

_We depend on a limited number of facilities and logistic partners for the distribution of the products that we_
_sell to our stores and could experience interruptions or delays in the distribution and delivery of the products_
_that we sell._

The continuous optimization of our procurement and logistics processes significantly impacts our
operational performance. The demands on logistics have continued to rise, especially with the growing
e-commerce business and the increasing interlinking of brick & mortar stores and e-commerce platforms. Due
to the accelerated shift of consumer demand towards online retailing, we have seen an increase in demand for
supply chain capacity at our e-commerce fulfillment facilities. Any failure of our supply chain or logistics service
providers to keep up with increased demand for capacity, either as a result of the shift towards online retailing
or any other market trends could result delays, disruptions or additional costs.

We have outsourced the vast majority of our logistics operations and cooperate with a few logistic
partners who, for example, run our e-commerce fulfilment centers in Germany, Italy, Poland, France and the
Netherlands. This outsourcing approach applies alike for some of our warehouses and cross-docking centers. It
may be difficult to replace our current logistics providers due to a lack of alternative offerings at comparable
prices and/or service quality and we may face higher costs when an existing logistics contract is renewed or
replaced.

The vast majority of our logistics sites are leased and some of the relevant leases, as well as some of
the logistics partner service agreements will expire within the next three years. If we are unable to renew the
respective leases, it may be difficult for us to lease suitable alternative locations on favorable terms and any
new leases may involve changes to our logistics organization, as well as increases in lease payments and other
costs. A similar risk applies to our logistics partner service agreements.

###### 54

As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we are in the process of moving towards a
One Warehouse, All Channels (“OWAC”) approach to our physical supply chain where we will replace our
existing logistics facilities with five warehouses that will service our physical stores and e-commerce customers
as well as handle partner fulfillment for our marketplace. In December 2020, we started construction on the first
OWAC site in Hamm, Germany. We currently expect that all five facilities will be owned, staffed and managed
by third party logistics partners and thus our dependency on our logistics partners will likely increase. There
can be no assurances that our logistics will successfully transition into the OWAC approach and the transition
process may lead to additional costs, disruptions or delays in the distribution and delivery of our products.

Any disruption to our relationship with any external transporters, major logistic partners or brand
manufacturers/brand suppliers with respect to logistic costs or similar could also adversely affect our business
or result in increased shipping costs, which could negatively affect our results of operations.

In addition, the delivery of the products that we sell (both the delivery to our brick & mortar store
network as well as to customers who purchased the products via our e-commerce platform) could be delayed
or fail due to technical problems, strikes or force majeure, including adverse weather conditions and
pandemics. Furthermore, any major operational disruptions or accidents in our warehouses and centers, and
any breakdowns or disruptions of the operations of our suppliers, might significantly impact our ability to
distribute products and maintain an adequate product supply chain and in-store inventory. For example, an
outbreak of COVID-19 could occur at any time among our employees or those of our logistics service
providers, which could lead to the implementation of additional hygiene procedures, including complete
lockdowns of our logistics facilities. In addition to delivery disruptions, our business could be negatively
affected if we receive damaged goods from our suppliers.

The realization of any of these logistics-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial position.

_A failure to adopt and apply technological advances in a timely manner and to successfully expand our multi-_
_and cross-channel capabilities could limit our growth and prevent us from maintaining profitability._

We face risks in connection with continuous technological development and the shift from traditional
sales channels such as brick & mortar stores to online and mobile-based channels and multi- and cross-channel
models, both of which can increase competitive pressure. For example, our online and mobile offerings must
keep pace with the technological development of the devices used by our customers, the technological
progress of our competitors and any consequential new shopping behaviors and trends. Recently, specialized
online or mobile applications relating to beauty in general and beauty products in particular have increased
significantly, contributing to substantial changes in shopping behavior and the use of distribution channels by
customers.

Furthermore, our success, in particular with respect to our e-commerce sales, depends on our ability
to continuously improve our technological platform and to develop new applications in line with the
technological development and trends in order to remain competitive. For example, the introduction of new
payment solutions may entail substantial costs and effort and there is no guarantee that such new solutions will
be accepted by customers, which may result in frustrated expenses. We may fail to adopt and apply new
technological advances in a timely manner, or experience difficulties or compatibility issues.

Any such failure to adopt and apply technological advances in a timely and effective manner and to
further invest into multi-channel strategies and their implementation could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position and results of operations.

_Our initiatives to support our brands, generate customer traffic and build or retain a loyal customer base, as_
_well as other marketing initiatives may not be effective._

In an environment characterized by increasing levels of promotions and associated customer
discounts, the growth of our sales depends on the success of our marketing and communications strategy and
our ability to respond to changing customer tastes and competitors’ promotional activities. We use various
tools, such as marketing events, online advertising, visual merchandizing, social media and in-store events to
support the positioning of our brand, acquire new customers, increase the number of customer visits to our
websites, the number of orders and the purchase size per order. We have made and will continue to make
significant investments in brand awareness and enhancement, customer acquisition and customer loyalty, and
there is a risk that such investments will prove ineffective.

The operating expenditures to support marketing initiatives may turn out to be higher than estimated
and require more management time than planned. There can be no assurance that our assumptions
supporting our marketing strategies will prove to be correct and that such expenditures will result in increased

###### 55


-----

sales or increased profitability. In addition, there can be no assurance that expenditures with respect to new
concepts and re-branding, or changes and updates to existing concepts, will be met with the expected
customer acceptance and lead to the anticipated results.

In addition, blogging and social media activities can heavily influence our business success. Critique in
blogs, forums and social media, based on ecological, ethical or many other considerations, regardless of
whether reasonable or not, may rapidly spread online. In such cases, a certain product may have to be
withdrawn or a campaign to be stopped, which may cause damage to our reputation and our brands as well as
result in additional costs.

Furthermore, certain advertising or marketing methods currently used by us may become less
effective or legally restricted in the future, marketing systems may malfunction, our online couponing system
may be disrupted or may be affected from outages, or our customer relationship management system may
suffer from a lack of availability or poor quality of customer data.

In addition, changes to the terms and conditions of social networking services as well as changes to
search algorithms of online search engines could limit our promotional capabilities, and there could be a
decline in the use of such social networking services by customers and potential customers in the future.

Failure to implement our marketing initiatives or our customer relationship management system
successfully, or their failure to result in improved profitability, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity,
financial position and results of operations and on the implementation of our growth strategy.

_We may be unable to successfully implement our store investment strategy or our investments into new_
_geographical markets and/or product areas._

Part of our growth strategy includes investments in our existing stores as well as, from time to time,
new store openings and expansion of our franchise program. However, we may not be able to implement our
strategy successfully or at the envisaged pace if our investments into selected locations are unsuccessful or if
we fail to identify and lease attractive store locations on acceptable terms, attract and hire skilled sales staff or
implement the required infrastructure. We may also face difficulties in obtaining adequate financing to fund
future investments or expansion or correctly estimating customer demand for brick & mortar sales. In addition,
the opening of additional franchised stores depends, in part, upon the availability of prospective franchisees
who meet our criteria.

In addition, we still intend to selectively enter new geographies from time to time. Entering a new
geographical market requires substantial investments and may not lead to the desired results or occur at the
desired pace. Our success in pursuing this strategy will be dependent on various factors including our
understanding of the target market, our ability to position ourselves within such new markets, as well as our
ability to offer products adapted to local preferences on competitive terms. No assurance can be given that we
will be able to successfully penetrate and operate in any new markets on a sustainable and profitable basis.

Factors that may negatively influence the planned expansion and result in higher-than-expected costs
or delays include, in particular, political or economic instability, difficulties in finding reliable local partners and
in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled staff, difficulties in prevailing over local competition
and in generating a sufficient level of sales, difficulties related to labor relations or compliance issues, as well as
any imposition of restrictions on import, investment or currency, such as tariffs and import quotas on the
repatriation of earnings and capital, and greater-than-expected competition. Furthermore, entering a new
market entails operational complexities and risks, such as adapting the product offerings as well as our
logistics, payment, fulfillment and customer care practices to take account of local tastes and practices and the
operation of country-specific online shops. If we fail to manage these challenges adequately or if any of these
risks materialize, the significant investments made may not be recovered and substantial losses may occur.

Moreover, we have explored different product offerings beyond our core beauty focus and we plan to
continue to develop selected non-core product offerings in the future. For example, we recently launched
“beauty food”, a non-core product category that includes food supplements. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in expanding into areas beyond our core beauty portfolio, that any new product
categories will perform as expected, and that the investments incurred in connection with such expansion will
be recovered. Even if new products begin to gain traction with our customers, we may need to sustain or
increase our advertising and marketing activities to ensure their continued success. In addition, our existing or
new competitors may also target these segments and may be able to pre-empt some of our expansion plans.
Our expansion into different product offerings or product categories may also subject us to new regulatory
regimes or lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could lead to increased compliance costs.
Furthermore, our plans to grow our business, among others, through the growth of products sold under our
own brands, may result in our taking greater risks on holding stock. If we are left with excess inventory of our
private label products, due to such products’ failure to meet customers’ tastes or preferences or for other

###### 56


-----

reasons, we may not be able to make arrangements with the suppliers of these products to dispose of the
excess stock or offset all or part of the costs incurred. There is a risk that this will materially affect our working
capital and liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position.

Our selected expansion into service offerings may not be successful due to its substantially different
business model, financial parameters and margins. In addition, customers may not accept us as a legitimate
point of service. For example, in the past, we installed hair dressing and beauty cabins across a number of
stores, testing different store concepts in selected locations. However, many of them were closed, since they
did not achieve the expected demand. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures
taken by governmental authorities such as social distancing and lockdowns, we have been unable to fully test
new service offerings at our stores.

Given the various challenges to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business,
there can be no assurance that our expansion strategy can be successfully implemented. The realization of any
of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

_We face certain risks in connection with past and future acquisitions and joint ventures, including failure to_
_effectively integrate the businesses and achieve expected synergies as well as unexpected liabilities._

We have strategically pursued acquisitions and entered into participations in order to expand our
footprint and operations. Such activities include both large-scale acquisitions, as well as smaller bolt-on
acquisitions across different countries with the aim of strengthening our presence and market position in the
respective jurisdictions. For example, in July 2017, we acquired Grupo Bodybell (“Bodybell”) in Spain, which
comprised 223 stores, two online shops and Bodybell’s logistics platform. In November 2017, we acquired a
portfolio of 103 stores and the e-commerce platform of Perfumerias If in Spain and Andorra as well as Limoni
S.p.A. (“Limoni”) and La Gardenia Beauty S.p.A. (“La Gardenia”), which together comprised approximately 500
stores across Italy. In August 2018, we acquired an 80.0% interest in Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH
(“Parfumdreams”), which comprised an online shop and brick & mortar stores in Germany. In July 2019, we
acquired a 51.0% interest in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH (“Niche Beauty”), an online portal for luxury, niche and
trend cosmetic brands. We have also entered into various joint ventures and cooperations.

In the future, we may consider selected acquisition opportunities, enter into joint ventures or
undertake investments or disinvestments in a targeted manner. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to identify suitable targets and consummate an acquisition or enter into joint ventures or investments on
favorable terms or at all. It is also possible that not all material risks in connection with acquisitions or the
establishment of joint ventures will be identified in the due diligence process and that such risks will not be
taken into account in the decision-making process or the respective agreements to a sufficient level or at all. In
addition, future acquisitions may also entail financial and tax restructuring measures which, even if designed
with the aim of achieving a tax-efficient structure, may expose us to risks, e.g., if the tax authorities were to
challenge any of the implemented measures.

Furthermore, past and future acquisitions, joint ventures and investments in businesses entail risks
relating to the integration of businesses, including the employees, processes, IT, logistics and other systems, as
well as product offerings. Such integration may be a complex, time consuming and expensive process and will
likely involve several uncertainties. These include the costs and expenses associated with unexpected
difficulties, the diversion of management’s attention from our daily operations and/or strategic business
decisions, the potential loss of key employees, difficulties in competing with existing stores or business or
diverting sales from existing stores or business, difficulties in complying with foreign regulatory requirements
and the additional demands on management related to the increase in the size and scope of our operations
following an acquisition.

For example, we have in the past and may in the future be required by antitrust authorities to dispose
of certain stores as part of an acquisition. While we typically aim to divest franchised stores, in order to meet
such conditions, we have disposed and may need to continue to dispose of certain directly operated stores,
which would have a more substantial adverse impact on our profitability than the termination of franchises
(which would mostly result in the loss of the respective royalties only). Due to our already large footprint and
the concentration of the selective beauty market in Europe, it may become increasingly difficult to meet the
requirements of antitrust and competition regulation when pursuing acquisition targets.

Even if we are able to successfully integrate newly-acquired businesses, this integration may not result
in the realization of the full synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, operational
efficiencies and other benefits that we expect. Furthermore, changes in brand name in the context of an
integration following a major acquisition are associated with additional costs and the risk of a potential loss of
business and reputation.

###### 57


-----

The realization of any of these risks in connection with past and future acquisitions and joint ventures
may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, profitability and growth, and thus on our
business, results of operations and financial position.

_We incurred and may continue to incur certain obligations and may face certain risks (subletting risks) in_
_connection with the divestiture of our non-perfumeries business._

In 2014, certain of our non-core businesses, including the book retail business (“Thalia”), the fashion
retail business (“Appelrath”), the jewelry retail business (“Christ”) and the confectionary business (“Hussel”,
together with Thalia, Appelrath and Christ, the “Disposed Businesses”) were carved out from our group and
later sold to third parties.

However, we remain party (as lessee) to some of the lease agreements relating to stores of the
Disposed Businesses, i.e. stores that are operated by the Disposed Businesses as sub-lessees and are thus
dependent on their punctual payment of rent. In addition, we remain liable for the Disposed Businesses’
payment obligations, either as guarantor or joint and several debtor, under certain lease agreements that have
been transferred to the Disposed Businesses. As a result, if one or more of the Disposed Businesses are in
default under the sub-lease, we may be held liable by the main lessor.

If and to the extent the Disposed Businesses no longer perform (or are no longer able to perform)
their obligations (in particular their payment obligations) or do not pay their rent punctually to the respective
lessor, there is a risk that we will suffer a shortfall in income, or are held liable for the Disposed Businesses’
obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some Disposed Businesses suspended and have continued
to suspend certain rent payments, which has resulted in us having to make rental payments on their behalf to
the respective lessor and could cause us to have to make such rental payments in the future.

_Our strategy and reorganization measures may not achieve the expected results._

There can be no assurances that any of our strategies including any reorganization measures will be
successful. For example, we have started to implement the next phase of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy,
known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst, where we focus on digitalization in order to further develop our
integrated beauty platform that links our brick & mortar stores and e-commerce platform. We may be required
to invest more than currently budgeted in order to implement our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we
may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining suitable talent in particular any technology specialists.
Furthermore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits associated with the strategy and may fail to
implement the strategy in the desired time frame or at all. The realization of any of these risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

In addition, we have carried out reorganization measures in the past few years and will continuously
adapt our structures and processes to the current needs of our markets. In light of the shift in customer
behavior towards online retailing, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have launched
our Store Optimization Program (“SOP”). Our SOP targets closing approximately 500 stores by the end of
September 2022 across out network but with a focus on Southern Europe, where our sales from brick & mortar
stores were particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and where there is currently high overlap in store
locations due to our historical acquisitions. See “Business—Strategy—Complement accelerating e-commerce
_channel with Store Optimization Program”. These costs have been reflected to a lesser degree in our financial_
statements, as our SOP was announced in January 2021. We may also carry out further reorganization
measures from time to time.

Such measures, including the SOP, entail costs, may divert management’s attention from our daily
business and/or strategic business decisions, and may otherwise be disruptive to our business. In addition, the
SOP anticipates a decrease in revenue in an attempt to optimize our portfolio. There can be no assurance that
such reorganization measures may lead to the expected efficiency improvements or cost savings or be
completed within the planned timeframe, for example should we wrongly identify stores that should be closed
as part of the SOP. Furthermore, our SOP assumes that a portion of sales from closed stores will be transferred
to our other stores in the same catchment area or our e-commerce platform and there can be no assurances
that such transfer will materialize to the extent anticipated or at all, in particular if governments in the countries
where we operate implement further lockdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional lockdowns
could also prolong periods of inventory recovery. Furthermore, any such reorganization process may have a
disruptive effect on our work force, could have and has resulted in disruptions through strike action such as
recently experienced in France and Spain or lead to adverse publicity as a result of store closures or otherwise.
We may also face additional costs as a result of negotiations with trade unions, employee representatives or
employees relating to severance payments or other compensations as well as landlord negotiations relating to
stores that we intend to close.

###### 58


-----

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, profitability and
growth, and thus on our business, results of operations and financial position.

_We may be unable to manage our growing business activities effectively._

Our business has grown significantly over the last decade, and continues to selectively expand,
whether via acquisitions or otherwise. We had an average number of employees of 21,016 (salaried employees
and excluding apprentices) in the financial year 2019/2020. As of December 31, 2020, we operated in 26
European countries with over 2,300 stores (including 141 franchised stores) in 20 countries and online shops in
24 countries. On a net basis, our brick & mortar store network grew by 454 stores (including stores that were
acquired as part of the acquisitions of Limoni and La Gardenia in Italy as well as Bodybell and Perfumerias If in
Spain and Andorra) between October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2020. Our online shops which we operate in
24 countries include several shops that were launched during the past few years, and we also plan to launch
additional online shops in the near future. We cannot guarantee that opening or acquiring additional brick &
mortar stores, the launch of new online shops or the further expansion of our e-commerce platform will not
adversely affect our existing operations.

Our operating complexity will continue to increase as we implement our growth strategy and will
require a continuous expansion and improvement of our operating capabilities and the training and
management of a growing employee base. Developing and refining the appropriate internal management,
accounting and book-keeping processes, organizational compliance and risk monitoring structures required
for this growth and the increasingly complex group structure places high demands on us and our
management, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure, with no assurance that sales and
profitability will increase accordingly. As our operations grow further, we will need to continue to improve and
upgrade our systems and infrastructure to deal with the greater scale and complexity of operations. Delays in
improving these systems and in reaching an appropriate level of staffing may result in business and
administrative oversights and errors, which may also lead to higher operating expenses.

In addition, our growth could make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will
need to make in the future. This growth could also impact the operational flexibility of the supply chain
organization and impair our ability to react promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends. If
we do not make the necessary capital or other expenditures to accommodate our future growth, we may not
be successful in our growth strategy. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service
levels for our customers and to develop and improve our internal controls. Moreover, certain businesses we
have acquired or may in the future acquire may have less robust internal controls than the rest of the Group,
which might create additional control challenges until the relevant standards can be upgraded to those used
by the rest of the Group.

We may be unable to accurately anticipate all the demands that our expanding operations will impose
on our business, personnel, systems and controls and procedures, and the failure to appropriately address
such demands, or the realization of any of the above-mentioned risks, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial position.

_Negotiating, terminating or extending store leases may be difficult or costly, which could negatively impact_
_our competitive position, growth strategy and profitability._

The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify suitable premises for our
brick & mortar stores in attractive locations and to negotiate acceptable lease terms. We compete with other
global and regional retailers to obtain favorable store locations and lease terms in shopping malls and in city
centers. If we are not able to secure attractive sites for new stores on acceptable terms, our further expansion
would be significantly impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Furthermore, new stores from other retailers or our own new stores in the
proximity of our existing stores could compete with our existing stores for customers.

Our commercial leases typically provide for an adjustment of the rent due to changes in certain public
indices. Such adjustments are intended to counteract inflation risks of long-term contracts. If the relevant
indices increase at a higher rate compared to past performances, or if there are adverse changes in terms of
calculations relating to such indices, rents linked to these indices will be adjusted at higher levels which could
increase our expenses and have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operation which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, many of
our lease agreements contain sales-related additional variable lease payments and hence, the ultimate level of
our rent will depend on the level of our sales. As part of our SOP, we intend to terminate leases of stores that
we are closing and re-negotiate certain other existing leases of our continuing store portfolio. There is no
guarantee that these re-negotiations will be successful and the cost, difficulty or time associated with such
re-negotiations may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

###### 59


-----

_Our ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of shopping centers and city_
_centers in which our stores are located, and any decrease in footfall at those retail destinations could adversely_
_impact our sales._

Our brick & mortar sales accounted for 74.0% of our sales for the financial year 2019/2020. Our
brick & mortar stores are typically located in prominent locations within shopping centers and town centers.
Our sales at these stores are dependent, to a significant extent, on the volume of customer traffic in such retail
destinations and the surrounding areas. This in turn benefits and is dependent on the ability of other retailers in
those destinations to generate customer traffic in the vicinity of such stores.

Our sales may, thus, be adversely affected by a decrease in popularity of the retail destinations or
anchor stores in the vicinity of our stores, the closing of anchor stores or a deterioration in the financial position
of retail destination operators or developers that could, for example, limit their ability to finance tenant
improvements for us and other retailers. Store closures by other retailers and vacancies in shopping centers
and other retail destinations may also decrease footfall. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain alternative store leases in prime locations on commercially acceptable terms. Moreover, properties
currently considered prime locations may deteriorate and become less desirable in the future.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the government measures undertaken to reduce the spread of
COVID-19, including the forced closure of non-essential shops, curfews, social distancing and hygiene
requirements, as well as precautionary measures taken by many individual consumers to minimize their contact
with other individuals in public, have significantly affected footfall in shopping centers and retail destinations.
See “—The outbreak of the Coronavirus has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material impact on our
_business and results of operations.” A decrease in footfall as a result of these or other factors constitutes a major_
challenge for the like-for-like development of our brick & mortar business.

We may also continue to be faced with the relatively high fixed costs relating to the leases of our
brick & mortar stores in prime locations, while achieving a lower level of sales from our brick & mortar business.
As a result of the lockdowns implemented by governments across Europe during the course of 2020, the
majority of our brick & mortar stores in various countries were closed during their respective lockdown periods.
In part pursuant to certain government initiatives aimed at alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for
businesses, we have attempted to defer and/or reduce lease payments on our leased premises for certain
lockdown-affected periods. However, our success at negotiating these arrangements have varied significantly
on a case by case basis depending on the landlord and country. There can be no assurances that we will be
able to obtain any rent deferrals or reductions in 2021, to aid in offsetting our relatively high fixed costs.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position.

_We may be unable to effectively manage our costs and inventories._

Our profitability depends on our ability to effectively manage operating costs, including the
implementation of cost-control programs relating to store leases and operations, cost-effective purchasing
programs for the products sold, the optimization of personnel costs, achieving central overhead cost synergies
and improving supply chain and inventory management. Our cost structure may be negatively affected by cost
increases, in particular those relating to rental, electricity and personnel costs, as well as transportation and
logistics costs, among others. In particular with respect to fulfillment costs, we have experienced such costs
increases in a significant manner in recent financial years, as a result of a higher share of e-commerce sales and
our OWAC strategy, which has led to a higher volume of outbound goods. In addition, the increasing shift
towards e-commerce may further affect our operating costs such as by increasing delivery costs.

Failure to control the amount and quality of our significant inventory stock could also reduce
profitability and increase losses. For example, constraints in our inventory management systems and/or
processes may cause excess inventory in one location and insufficient inventory in another. Conversely, failure
to order enough stock or problems in the delivery and distribution of stock could result in unfilled orders and
missed sales opportunities.

If we are unable to continue to achieve these economies of scale and cost efficiencies due to
fluctuations in our operating costs or for other reasons, this could also have a negative impact on our results of
operations. In addition, if we fail to effectively manage our operating costs or inventory stocks, our profitability
and growth could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position.

_Our operations may be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected as a result of failures in our information_
_technology systems._

Our success and daily operations depend on the continuous and uninterrupted availability and quality
of our information technology (“IT”) systems and the relevant data. This data includes orders and other

###### 60


-----

customer transactions, to manage inventory, to purchase and ship the products that we sell, and to effectively
manage the operations of our brick & mortar stores and e-commerce platform. We also depend on our IT
systems to be able to effectively manage our customer relationships. With technological advances, greater
networking and an increasing integration of business processes, the need for the permanent availability of our
IT systems has become even more critical. In addition, certain of the IT systems used for our brick & mortar
business and substantially all of the IT systems used for our e-commerce platform are hosted externally
(including cloud services) by third-party service providers.

Management uses certain IT-based demand-forecast tools and other IT systems to support decision
making and to monitor business performance. In case of a system disruption, including any difficulties during
rollouts, we may fail to generate accurate and complete financial and operational reports essential for making
decisions at various levels of management, which could lead to less-informed decisions being made.

We have purchased cyber insurance coverage to cover a limited number of risks which could be
caused by an interruption of our IT systems through hacking or other cyber-attacks, but the risk of disruption to
our IT systems cannot be entirely eliminated. Our cyber insurance coverage is subject to limitations, caps and
deductibles, such that our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. See also “—Our insurance coverage could
_prove inadequate.” Such disruptions may result from a range of factors, including events beyond our control,_
such as telecommunication problems, software errors, hardware failures, power outages or damages, user
errors, inadequate capacity at IT centers, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or other third parties or other
security issues, fire or natural disasters. Any material disruption or slowdown of our IT systems could cause
information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, and functionalities to be
interrupted, both of which could disrupt our ability to market, offer and sell our products, as well as our ability
to track, record and analyze the sales of our products, which could negatively impact our operations and result
in lost sales, in particular if occurring in one of our peak selling periods. In addition, our business could be
adversely affected if changes in technology cause our IT systems to become obsolete or outdated or if our IT
systems are inadequate to handle our growth. Moreover, certain of our subsidiaries, especially ones that have
recently been acquired by us, may have less robust IT systems and cyber security frameworks, which could
increase their vulnerability to disruption or cyber-attacks until they can be upgraded to the standards used by
the rest of the Group. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial position.

_We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified managerial staff and skilled, motivated personnel._

The success of our business depends significantly on our ability to retain senior management, other
qualified managers and employees in key positions, many of whom have many years of experience and
specialized expertise in our business. Competition for qualified, motivated personnel is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain all members of our senior management team or a sufficient number of
qualified personnel in the future.

Also, as we centralize and standardize many tasks which were previously performed by store
personnel, we may lose some of our employees due to difficulties or motivational issues relating to the loss of
autonomy of individual stores.

Any failure to attract and retain senior management or qualified staff could impair our growth and
ability to manage our operations effectively and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

_We are exposed to the risk of rising labor costs, as well as work stoppages, strikes or other collective actions._

Personnel expenses represent a significant part of our cost base. We may face considerable wage
increases in the future, for example in connection with increasing statutory minimum wages, due to collective
bargaining agreements that apply to us in certain jurisdictions or otherwise as a result of general rising wages.
If we are not successful in limiting such increases in personnel costs or the effects thereof, or if cost increases or
the effects thereof cannot be passed on to our customers, this may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations.

In addition, since our business is labor intensive, maintaining good relationships with our employees,
trade unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. Works councils have been
established at certain Group companies and it cannot be excluded that employees will demand the
establishment of further works councils. As certain of our employees are members of trade unions or enjoy
similar rights due to applicable laws in the countries where we operate, we have in the past experienced and
are subject to the risk of strikes, in particular if employees are dissatisfied with salary levels or proposed salary
increases, personnel or other business measures affecting our workforce or during busy trading periods such

as Christmas. For example, our SOP targets the closure of approximately 500 stores across our store network
and resulted in a local strike in France in February 2021, and a strike in Spain in March 2021. There can be no
assurances that we will not face further strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with trade unions,
employee representatives or our employees in the future in connection with the SOP or otherwise.

Any deterioration of our relationships or disputes with trade unions, employee representatives or our
employees or any material work stoppages, strikes, further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with
trade unions, employee representatives or our employees could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial position.

_We have financial obligations to our employees, in particular retirement benefit obligations, the calculations of_
_which are based on a number of assumptions, which may differ from actual rates._

As part of the employment compensation package, we provide different retirement benefit
arrangements or similar benefits. Our defined benefit obligations are based on certain actuarial assumptions
that can vary by country, including discount rates, life expectancies and rates of an increase in compensation
levels. Provisions are recognized for funded and non-funded employer-financed commitments arising from
retirement benefit entitlements and ongoing payments to employees and former employees and their
surviving dependents. They are also recognized for purely employee-funded commitments from deferred
compensation. These commitments are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19
(Employee Benefits).

A change in actuarial assumptions or market conditions with respect to, for example, discount rates,
life expectancies or compensation figures, could affect the present value of our liabilities and lead to an
increase in our defined benefit obligation and to additional provisioning required, which may have a material
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

_Our assets, such as goodwill and the “Douglas”, “Nocibé” and other key brands owned by us are subject to_
_the risk of impairment._

As of December 31, 2020, we had intangible assets and right-of-use assets from leases totaling
€3,218.1 million. The intangible assets mainly consisted of goodwill, the “Douglas” brand and the “Nocibé”
brands. The right-of-use assets in an amount of €1,178.4 million reflect our leasehold interests accounted for
under IFRS 16. We determine the value of the intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting
principles and distinguish between amortizable intangible assets, and non-amortizable assets, such as
goodwill.

With respect to intangible assets that are not amortized and to the right-of-use assets from leases, an
impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on which the current carrying amount are based
are not fulfilled and the recoverable amount of any cash generating unit is less than the Group’s carrying
amount, such as if market and industry conditions deteriorate or interest rates rise.

In performing impairment tests of assets, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, including our
main brands, management considers several assumptions and carries out analyses that are based on
projections and judgments. Economic downturns, including deteriorating economic conditions in the
industries and regional markets in which we operate and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as
legal, regulatory, competitive, contractual and other factors may affect these assumptions and therefore the
value of our assets. In addition, impairments on property, plant and equipment and right of use assets from real
estate leases are recorded from time to time triggered by ongoing negative contribution margins of certain
stores and intended store closures. Recognition of an impairment charge would reduce our reported assets
and earnings. For example, in the financial year 2019/2020, we recorded goodwill impairments of
€279.7 million relating to former acquisitions. We cannot predict whether future impairment charges may
become necessary.

An impairment loss with respect to intangible assets and/or deferred tax assets may have a material
adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations.

_The payment methods that we accept expose us to operational, regulatory and fraud risks._

We currently offer different payment methods tailored to meet our local customers’ payment
preferences, both in our brick & mortar stores and online shops including cash, invoicing, credit and debit
cards, PayPal, advance payment, online bank transfer pursuant to the electronic payment standard, direct
debit, checks, and in Germany and Austria with the Douglas Beauty Card Premium and gift cards. Payments in
transit using certain of these payment methods, as well as cash in tills, are taken into account when calculating
net leverage ratios pursuant to the Indentures as well as other of our financing arrangements.

###### 62


-----

We face the risk of operational failures during the checkout process in our e-commerce platform
relating to the complexity of certain payment methods. Such difficulties could adversely affect our conversion
rate which is the proportion of site visitors that actually complete the purchasing process. We may also become
subject to additional or changing regulations regarding certain payment methods, such as the operating rules
and certification requirements of payment scheme associations and rules governing electronic funds transfers,
which apply to credit and debit cards, whether in general or in a particular country in which we operate. We
may also become subject to more stringent or complex compliance requirements, for example with respect to
certain of our gift cards. For certain payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, we also pay interchange
and other fees, which may increase over time and cause our operating expenses to rise. In Germany, we also
operate the payment infrastructure for our physical stores, which creates additional risks beyond the payment
risks discussed above. Any disruption in these payment systems could adversely affect the payment processing
capabilities at these stores.

Furthermore, customers may claim that purchases or payments were not properly authorized or were
transmitted in error. We also face the risk that customers may have insufficient funds, and of various types of
fraud or cyber-attacks. Any failure to avoid or limit losses from fraudulent transactions could damage our
reputation and result in increased legal expenses and fees. In the case of invoicing and of customers paying
with the Douglas Beauty Card Premium, we also carry a certain risk of non-payment of invoices or insufficient
funds.

In case of repeated fraud events relating to credit card transactions, in addition to the direct losses, we
could lose the right to accept credit cards for payments going forward and, potentially, credit and debit card
providers could cease payments to us for purchases already made. For example, the risk of an invalid transfer
instruction by a customer, and thus the risk of abuse, lies generally with the retailer in some of the countries in
which we operate. Therefore, we could become liable for certain fraudulent credit card transactions, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We also face
the risk that authorities might take the view that the issuance and redemption of our gift voucher cards or the
provision of certain other services in our stores may violate certain legal requirements of the EU Payment
Services Directive, and other applicable regulatory requirements.

Any of the above risks related to payment methods could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial position.

_We face a risk of theft or misappropriation of funds and products in our stores, our warehouses or logistics_
_centers and those of our logistic partners, and we are exposed to a risk of misappropriation of our customer_
_data and other inappropriate behavior._

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a risk of theft of our products in our brick &
mortar stores. Products may also be misappropriated during transportation or at our warehouses and logistic
centers and those of our logistic partners. In addition, we may experience a misappropriation of funds in our
stores or at other levels of our business or the abuse of our resources such as our products, vouchers, bonuses
or systems.

Our business involves the storage and transmission of customers’ personal information, consumer
preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers
and our own business. For example, we collect and store certain customer data using our Douglas Beauty Card
/ Nocibé Card, including personal information and information regarding our customers’ preferences and
purchasing patterns. While we believe we employ industry-standard methods for data protection, our
information systems have faced in the past, and may face in the future, cyber-attacks, and are vulnerable to an
increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks, as cyber criminals develop new ways to gain
unlawful access to protected information systems. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security,
whether external or internal, or misuse of associate or customer data, could significantly damage our
reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or business information, and
result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. While we have implemented systems and processes to
protect us against unauthorized access to or use of secure data and to prevent data loss, there can be no
guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the
data. Moreover, regulations related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy are becoming
increasingly rigorous in the countries and regions in which we operate, with new and constantly changing
requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional
costs. See also “We are subject to numerous laws and regulations with respect to private data protection and
_failure to comply with such laws and regulations, may result in litigation and administrative or arbitration_
_proceedings and/or significantly damage our relationship with our customers; and we may also be adversely_
_affected by changes in these laws and regulations.”_

Moreover, we have a customer friendly returns policy and regularly offer gift articles in combination
with the purchase of a certain product or brand or, in particular in our online shops, for purchases over a

###### 63


-----

certain amount. It cannot be excluded that, in the future, a growing number of customers may abuse our
returns policy and, for example, return products bought from other retailers, or order from us with the sole
purpose of retaining the gift articles while returning the purchased products.

Our failure to prevent the theft or misappropriation of customer data or to manage our returns policy
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

_Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position._

In the last three financial years we generated our sales and purchased merchandise predominately in
Euros and to a limited extent also in a number of non-Euro currencies, such as the Polish zloty, the Romanian
leu, the Czech koruna, the Hungarian forint, the Croatian kuna, the Bulgarian lev and the Swiss franc. Our sales
in countries where the Euro is the legal tender represented 90.2% of our total sales in the financial year
2019/2020. Due to the growth of our regional footprint, our SOP and adjustments as a result of
COVID-19-related catch-up effects, we expect the share of our sales and costs in non-Euro currencies to
increase. Exchange rate fluctuations also affect the translated value of balance sheet and income statement
positions of our non-Euro Group companies, which are denominated in the relevant national currency,
predominantly in Polish zloty, since these positions must be converted into Euro in connection with the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. As a result, exchange losses may arise due to this
conversion. As we have not entered into currency hedging contracts, exchange rate fluctuations may have a
material adverse effect on our financial position.

Should we decide to enter into hedging arrangements in the future, we may not be able to adequately
hedge against the currency risk on reasonable terms and the cost of hedging may increase. Furthermore,
hedging counterparties may default on their obligations towards us due to lack of liquidity, operational failure,
bankruptcy or for other reasons.

_Our insurance coverage could prove inadequate._

We have comprehensive insurance policies in relation to a number of risks associated with our
business activities. However, our insurance coverage is subject to customary exclusions, limits and deductibles.

Given the diversity of locations and settings in which our employees provide services and the range of
our activities, we may not be able to accurately foresee all relevant activities and situations in order to ensure
that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies. As a result, we may incur losses or be subject
to claims that exceed the type, scope or amount of our existing insurance coverage. At the same time, we have
identified several risks that cannot be insured on economically feasible terms and for which, therefore, we have
chosen not to purchase insurance cover. These risks include, for example, business interruptions caused by
acts of terror, epidemics or pandemics.

If one or more claims exceed a certain aggregate amount in a given calendar year, insurers may
increase the insurance premiums or the terms and conditions of our insurance coverage may become less
favorable than at present. Our insurance costs may also increase over time in response to any negative
development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. The
COVID-19 pandemic has also placed significant upward price pressure on the market for director’s and
officer’s insurance, as well as cyber insurance, which could lead to increased costs for our insurance coverage.
There is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at commercially
reasonable terms or at all.

Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position
and results of operations.

_Many of our suppliers rely on credit insurance to protect their receivables, and any changes to, or too slow_
_adjustments or withdrawals of, such credit insurance might cause suppliers to seek to reduce their credit_
_exposure to us._

We believe that many of our suppliers have traditionally taken out credit insurance to protect their
receivables against the risk of bad debt, insolvency or protracted default of their buyers, including us. Credit
levels available to us from our suppliers remain dependent on the general economic environment, the credit
insurer’s risk policies and our financial position. If there is a significant decrease in the availability of credit
insurance to our suppliers, or if an increase in credit levels is administered too slowly or such insurance is
withdrawn in its entirety, and if such suppliers are unwilling or unable to take credit risk themselves or find
alternative credit sources, they may choose to reduce their credit exposure to us, for example by seeking to
change their credit terms vis-à-vis our Group by tightening payment terms or demanding advance payment.

###### 64


-----

Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our working capital and cash positions, lead to an
increase in our indebtedness or have a negative impact on our product offerings and, thus, on our sales. This
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

_We present information relating to Management Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum; the data_
_used in calculating this information is unaudited and involves significant management estimates, assumptions_
_and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them._

The Management Adjusted EBITDA and related footnotes thereto presented in this offering
memorandum are illustrative and presented for information purposes only. They are subject to significant
management assumptions and estimates, have not been calculated based on our most recent 12 months of
trading available and have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent
accounting firm. See “Summary Historical Financial and Other Information” for more information.

The COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our business during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, primarily due to the temporary closure of the majority of our stores for periods throughout
2020. We present Management Adjusted EBITDA to illustrate management’s estimate of our recovery potential
after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account structural shifts that we have observed in our
sales channels which we expect to continue, as well as store closures and the impact of our SOP and the impact
of #ForwardOrganization.

This information does not represent the results that we would have achieved had the COVID-19
pandemic not occurred. We calculated Management Adjusted EBITDA using information derived from our
unaudited management accounts, which include certain deviations from IFRS and adjustments, and applying
significant management assumptions and estimates. The assumptions and management account data to derive
the Management Adjusted EBITDA have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent accounting firm, and do not constitutes a measure of financial performance under IFRS. You
should not consider Management Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income or any other performance
measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity, or as a
historical performance measure at all. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate a
similarly titled financial measure differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Therefore, Management Adjusted
EBITDA is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of our
results of operations for any historical or future period, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial
statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be unduly
relied upon when making an investment decision.

Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks

_We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and may be_
_adversely affected by changes in legislation and regulation._

We are confronted with differing legal, political, social, regulatory and economic conditions, as well as
unforeseeable developments in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, including, among others,
employment, accounting, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, general privacy, health,
information privacy, identity theft, online privacy, IT and e-commerce, unsolicited commercial communication
and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the
importation, promotion and sale of products and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. If these
regulations were to change or were violated, for example, by our management, employees or franchisees, by
the manufacturers of the products we sell or by our suppliers, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we
could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational
harm, which could reduce demand for the products that we sell and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position and results of operations.

In addition, the sale, distribution and marketing of certain products that we sell, in particular, cosmetic
products, are highly regulated. For example, not only as a distributor, but especially with respect to certain of
our own brand products, certain of our subsidiaries act as responsible persons for purposes of the European
Cosmetic Products Regulation and may be subject to liability under this regulation. Furthermore, and
irrespective of obligations under the European Cosmetic Products Regulation, as a distributor and as we
import and market certain products under our (brand) name, we are subject to regulations regarding
environmental law, food law (including food-related regulations and nutritional requirements), medical device
law, product safety and product liability under which we are obliged, inter alia, to monitor that the products we
offer comply with general safety requirements and must adopt the necessary measures to avoid any safety
threats, for example, by withdrawing unsafe products from the market, informing customers and recalling
products that have already been supplied to customers to avoid being exposed to the risks of liability.

###### 65


-----

With regard to IT and e-commerce activities, frequent changes in both the legal and the technological
developments increase the risk of non-compliance with legal demands, which could harm our reputation and
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Failure to comply with any relevant rules and regulations or a delayed implementation of internal
processes may result in licenses or authorizations required in connection with the relevant business areas being
withdrawn or not being granted in the future, or may subject us to significant penalties or claims, and in some
cases may even constitute a punishable offence, and significantly affect our ability to conduct our business,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Legal requirements are frequently changing and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to
predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to
define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our employees or franchisees
may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant
expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which
may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

In addition, we are indirectly affected by changes in the laws, regulations, administrative actions and
policies with which suppliers of our products, in particular the manufacturers of our own brand products, as
well as our marketplace partners must comply. For example, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging,
labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our suppliers’ products, our own brand products and our
marketplace partners’ products are subject to extensive consumer laws and regulations in different
jurisdictions, which may change or develop over time in a way that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations.

_We are subject to numerous laws and regulations with respect to private data protection and failure to comply_
_with such laws and regulations, may result in litigation and administrative or arbitration proceedings and/or_
_significantly damage our relationship with our customers; and we may also be adversely affected by changes_
_in these laws and regulations._

We are subject to local and international laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention,
sharing, otherwise processing and security of personal data. A failure to comply with applicable laws or
regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to us becoming subject to
penalties or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The
need to comply with data protection legislation is a significant controlling, operational and reputational risk
which can affect us in a number of ways including, for example, making it more difficult to maintain and expand
our marketing data, commercially utilize available data and also through potential litigation and governmental
investigations relating to the alleged misuse of personal data. Regulation regarding data collection and data
protection may also become stricter in the future. New laws, regulations or developments in this field and
changes in consumer behavior could interfere with our strategies to use privacy-related information for our
multi-channel marketing efforts and could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

Significant modifications in laws or regulations, as well as changes in the interpretation and
enforcement practices of authorities concerning existing laws and regulations, in countries in which we operate
may consequently lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices. Also,
compliance will become more complex and involve higher costs and the increasing risk of non-compliance
may give rise to civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges.
For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) on data privacy introduced substantial
changes to the EU and local data protection regimes, involving replacement in Member States of major parts of
the previous national data protection laws by a directly applicable EU regulation. Since the GDPR came into
effect on May 25, 2018, it has imposed a substantially higher compliance burden on our business. In addition,
the regulation entails higher maximum level of fines than was historically the case for potential compliance
failures. Given our increasing focus on the online segment of our business, we will have to adapt to any change
in the legal environment with regards to data protection, which could lead to significant implementation costs.

There are also several initiatives pending aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European
market such as an e-privacy regulation or the proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. We may
also be indirectly affected by European Union court rulings. For example, the European Court of Justice
(Fashion ID, C-40/17 and Planet 49, C-673/17) in 2018 and 2019 specified the treatment of internet tracking
technologies and issued another judgment (Schrems II, C-311/18) in 2020 relating to European data protection
laws, stating that the transfer of personal data into the United States cannot be based on the EU/US Privacy
Shield framework. This ruling has an impact also on data transfers to any other third country within the meaning
of the GDPR that does not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the EU, unless the EU Commission

###### 66


-----

adopted an adequacy decision for that third country outside the EEA. Overall, the European Court of Justice
rulings may lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices in this respect.

In the past, some of our data has been, and in the future we are exposed to the risk that our data could
be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed in breach of data protection regulations, by us or
on our behalf. If we or any third-party service providers on which we may rely fail to transmit customer
information in a secure manner, or if any such loss of personal customer data were otherwise to occur, we
could face liability under data protection and IT security laws. This could also result in the loss of our customers’
goodwill and deter new customers. The technical and organizational measures we have put in place to protect
our data and for IT security may not be sufficient or modern enough to protect all our data at any given time or
comply with any applicable legal requirements in their entirety, which may lead to a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position and results of operations.

Our failure to comply with local and international laws governing personal data or if we fail to protect
our data from being misappropriated could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position
and results of operations.

_We may be adversely affected by changes in antitrust and competition laws and regulations, in particular with_
_respect to selective distribution contracts._

As a significant market participant in European premium beauty markets, we are subject to antitrust
and competition laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the introduction of new antitrust or
competition laws in the jurisdictions that are relevant to our operations or the interpretation or enforcement of
existing competition laws will not affect our business and operations in the future or will not restrain us from
making acquisitions or expanding our business, in the event we wish to do so in the future.

Furthermore, the use of selective distribution contracts, i.e., contracts that require formal approval of
the supplier for the product to be listed and which limit the sale of fragrance products almost exclusively to
“selected” distributors, is critical to our current business model. Selective distribution currently benefits from a
specific legal framework (see also “Regulation on Selective Distribution Systems”) provided by Art. 101 (1)
TFEU, and specific national laws prohibit agreements which have an anticompetitive objective or restrictive
effects on competition, unless such agreements fall under EU Regulation No. 330/2010 (Vertical Block
Exemption Regulation) or individual exemptions pursuant to Art. 101 (3) TFEU. Such exemption requires,
among other things, that the market share of both the supplier and the authorized distributor does not exceed
30% and respective agreements do not contain so-called “hard core” restrictions of competition. In the context
of selective distribution systems, resale price maintenance, restrictions of active or passive sales to end
consumers as well as restrictions of cross-supplies between authorized distributors constitute such “hard core”
restrictions.

The above exemption under Regulation (EU) No 330/2010 is scheduled to expire in May 2022. The
European Commission plans to issue a revised version of the regulation and has launched a public consultation
on possible amendments, but the outcome of consultations and any amendments cannot be certain. The terms
and conditions of such agreements must be individually reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

Contractual clauses violating European competition law are void, which may also affect the remainder
of agreements entered into while the current block exemptions were in force. Furthermore, in such instances,
the relevant competition authorities may initiate proceedings against the parties to such anticompetitive
agreements, and substantial fines can be imposed.

However, following changes in the applicable laws, regulations, case law or the application thereof by
competition authorities, other distribution channels may begin selling products (or increasingly sell products)
that currently generate the majority of our sales and this may lead to a significant increase in competition,
potentially requiring us to cut our profit margins in order to remain competitive which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

European competition law prohibits the abuse of a dominant position. An infringement of Art 102
TFEU requires that the relevant undertaking is dominant on the relevant market and is abusing this dominant
position.

_We are or may become involved in litigation and administrative or arbitration proceedings, which may_
_adversely affect our financial position._

We may become involved in litigation, administrative and arbitration proceedings, such as laborrelated litigation, intellectual property litigation or litigation or arbitration proceedings with our customers,

###### 67


-----

suppliers or franchisees as part of our ordinary business activities. For example, even if we strive to limit the risk
of warranty claims for product defects or from product liability claims by including recourse clauses in our
agreements with suppliers and with manufacturers, we may be exposed to such claims and, in the event that
the supplier is financially unable to respond for the damage or should our insurance not cover the claims
asserted against us adequately or at all, we may have to bear the costs related to the product liability, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Any such proceedings, even if we are successful, could divert management resources, incur certain
expenses and cause damage to our reputation. The involvement in any such litigation, administrative and
arbitration proceedings as well as the outcome of such litigation and proceedings, which cannot be predicted
and may not be in accordance with our assessments, may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

We are currently subject to several pending litigation proceedings. For example, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer is party to legal proceedings pending in the Dortmund District Court (“Landgericht”) where
several former minority shareholders are requesting an adjustment of the compensation in connection with the
squeeze-out of the minority shareholders of Douglas Holding AG (merged into the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer) in connection with a take-private transaction under prior ownership, which became effective in July
2013. To cover risks associated with these proceedings we have presented a provision of €12.7 million in the
financial year 2019/2020, which was recognized in prior years.

If we are unsuccessful in defending any current or future claims, we may incur liabilities in excess of the
reserved amounts. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

_If we and/or our suppliers are unable to protect our and/or their respective intellectual property rights, in_
_particular trademarks and key domain names, our ability to compete could be adversely affected._

The market for the products and services that we offer depends to a significant extent upon the value
associated with their respective brands. Therefore, our commercial success depends on our and our suppliers’
ability to successfully defend our and their intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, customer
lists and domain names, including the ability of franchised stores to operate in a manner consistent with our
required standards and guidelines in this area.

In particular, we own a large portfolio of trademarks, including word trademarks and word/device
trademarks used by companies in our Group and by franchisees, domain names, and some design rights. In
particular, the trademarks that protect the brand “Douglas” (including the new Douglas logo) as well as the
trademark “Nocibé” are of key importance to us. Furthermore, we use some smaller local (sub-) brands or
company symbols to differentiate our offering and address different target groups. With respect to several of
the registered trademarks, we have entered into co-existence agreements and prior rights agreements for
specific countries or situations. Regarding domain names, in particular “douglas.de”, and the top-level domains
for other countries, in particular those in which we operate an online shop, play an important role in our
business operations. Our own brand products are manufactured by third parties and thus while we own the
brand, labelling and in some cases, the product design of such products, we do not own their underlying
recipes or formulas.

We expect to continue to file further trademark applications seeking to protect selected newlydeveloped brands or products or apply for registration of existing brands or products in other relevant
jurisdictions, but we cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued. There is also a risk that we
could, by omission, fail to renew a trademark (or design or domain) on a timely basis or fail to pursue our brand
monitoring. Moreover, there is the risk that our competitors may challenge, invalidate, dilute or circumvent any
existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, even though a trademark has been duly
registered, under local regulation the fact that a trademark is not used for a certain period of time (such as five
years in the European Union) may render the trademark registration voidable. Moreover, earlier rights (such as
a pre-existing right to a name, copyrights and other industrial property rights) may prevail over the registration
of the trademark. With respect to domain names, these are generally regulated by internet regulatory bodies
and may also be subject to trademark laws and other related laws of each country.

If we do not have or cannot obtain or maintain on reasonable terms the ability to use our “Douglas” or
“Nocibé” trademarks, or any other significant brand in a particular country, or to use or register “Douglas” for a
certain domain name, we could be forced either to incur significant additional expenses to market our
products within that country, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional
materials and packaging, or to elect not to sell products in that country. Furthermore, the regulations
governing domain names and laws protecting marks and similar proprietary rights could change in ways that
block or interfere with our ability to use relevant domains or our current brands. In addition, we may not be

###### 68


-----

able to prevent third parties from registering, using or retaining domain names that interfere with our customer
communications or infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks, domain names and other
proprietary rights. Regulatory bodies may establish additional generic or country-code top-level domains or
may allow modifications of the requirements for registering, holding or using domain names. As a result, we
may not be able to register, use or maintain the domain names that utilize the name “Douglas” or “Nocibé” in
all of the countries in which we currently conduct business or intend to conduct business in the future.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance we will be able to adequately or sufficiently prevent
infringement or misappropriation of our portfolio of intellectual property by third parties, and we may be
subject to disputes relating to our logos and branding. If any of these events occur, our ability to compete may
be adversely affected.

The realization of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

_We may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties and be liable for damages and litigation costs._

Our store format, web presence (including advertising activities and marketplace), IT structure and our
designs (e.g., relating to our own brands and other products), among others, may violate intellectual property
rights of third parties. If we are perceived to have adopted trends or designs developed by competitors or to
have exceeded our contractual or statutory usage rights regarding IP (e.g., copyrights regarding software and
applications used by us or trademark rights regarding the products presented by us), we may become subject
to claims alleging that we have violated the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We may be prevented by
third parties from using, sourcing or marketing certain designs and ideas. If we violate a third party’s rights, we
may be liable for damages as well as litigation costs. This may reduce sales and, damage our reputation, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

_We use standardized sales, purchase and supply agreements, as well as standardized terms and conditions,_
_which increase the potential that all contract terms used therein may be invalid or unenforceable if any clause_
_is held to be void._

We entertain legal relationships with a large number of persons, primarily customers, suppliers,
manufacturers of our own brands and similar products and our employees. In this context we also use
standardized documents, standard-form contracts and standardized terms and conditions. If such documents,
contracts or terms and conditions turn out to contain provisions that are disadvantageous to us or if clauses in
such documents or contracts are declared invalid and thus displaced by statutory provisions which are
unfavorable to us, a large number of standardized documents, contracts or terms and conditions could be
affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

Additionally, standardized contractual terms in the countries in which we operate are subject to rigid
fairness controls by the courts regarding their content and the way they, or legal concepts described therein,
are presented to the other contractual party by the person using them. The standard is even stricter if they are
used vis-à-vis consumers, which the vast majority of our customers are. As a general rule, standardized terms
are invalid if they are not transparent, clearly worded, or if they are unbalanced or discriminate against the
other party inappropriately. Due to the frequent changes to the legal framework, particularly with regard to
court decisions relating to individual general terms and conditions, we cannot fully protect ourselves against
risks arising from the use of such standardized contractual terms. Even if documents, contracts and terms and
conditions are prepared with legal advice, it is not possible to avoid all potential risks from the outset or in the
future, as the changes may continue to occur in the legal framework, particularly through case law. A change in
the applicable legal framework could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

_We are subject to tax risks, and our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws, such laws’_
_application or interpretation, or as a result of current or future tax audits._

Our tax burden is dependent on certain aspects of the tax laws across several different jurisdictions
and their application and interpretation. Changes in tax laws or their interpretation or application or changes in
the amount of taxes imposed on companies could increase our future tax burden. As a result of current or
future tax audits or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities, our internal tax assessments,
including our interpretation and application of tax laws, could be revised and/or additional taxes, including
interest and penalty payments or social security payments, could be assessed in relation to future or previous
tax assessment periods which could lead to an increase in our tax obligations, either as a result of the relevant

###### 69


-----

tax payment being assessed directly against us or as a result of our becoming liable for the relevant tax as a
secondary obligor due to the primary obligor’s (such as, for example, an employee) failure to pay. This may be
due to an interpretation or view of laws and/or facts by tax authorities in a manner deviating from our view.

Due to our international focus, we are exposed to tax risks, in particular with regard to transfer pricing
rules that apply in several jurisdictions and in relation to cross border business relationships. Pursuant to such
rules, related enterprises are obligated to conduct any inter-company transactions on conditions which would
also apply among unrelated third parties concluding comparable agreements (so-called “at arm’s length
principle”) and to provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to the rules applicable to them in the
relevant jurisdiction. The possibility that the tax authorities will challenge our compliance with applicable
transfer pricing rules cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, transfer pricing risks may increase in the future as intragroup cross-border business grows.

We are subject to tax audits by the respective tax authorities on a regular basis. Tax audits in Germany
relating to financial year 2010 to financial year 2015 have been completed, but the reports have not yet been
announced. We expect to pay taxes (including interest) of €28.0 million in this calendar year. Therefore,
provisions for taxes of €28.0 million exist as of December 31, 2020. A new tax audit for financial year 2016 to
financial year 2019 in Germany has been started, but no findings have been announced as of the date of this
offering memorandum. A tax audit for financial year 2014 to financial year 2016 in France is completed but in
litigation. We expect a tax (also CVAE) payment of €10.1 million in April 2021. This amount is accrued as of
December 31, 2020. We have already successfully appealed against another tax audit issue in France before
the National Tax Commission. If the FTA does not follow the view of the National Tax Commission, we expect a
tax payment of €11.8 million in this fiscal year. In the event that this occurs, we plan to take legal action. For
Italy, no tax audit is currently ongoing, but a risk exists in connection with past tax audits, currently pending on
the Regional/District tax court. Provisions of €5.8 million have been accrued as of December 31, 2020, in line
with our internal estimations.

As a result of current or future tax audits or other reviews by the tax authorities, additional taxes
(including withholding taxes, real estate transfer tax, capital duty and stamp duty) could be assessed on us or
tax losses carried forward as well as interest expenses carried forward for purposes of the German interest
stripping rules could be reduced, which could lead to an increase in our tax obligations and thus have a
material adverse effect on our financial position.

Our corporate structure has been, and may be in the future, subject to reorganization measures (for
example, transfer of subsidiaries, carve-outs or mergers including the Post-Closing Reorganization). We may
not be aware of a certain tax issue or that the tax authorities will question some or all of the positions that we
have taken and, consequently, additional taxes may be assessed or tax assets be challenged. Furthermore, due
to our international operations, we are exposed to risks arising from the application of international tax
concepts used for the purpose of allocating taxing rights between countries, for example the concept of
permanent establishment as used, inter alia, in OECD model treaties. In particular, our business activities
outside Germany might inadvertently trigger taxing rights of foreign countries (e.g., due to a representative’s
permanent establishment), leading to additional tax burdens for us.

VAT rates could increase in the future in the countries in which we operate. If we do not increase the
prices of the products that we sell to match the increase in VAT, our profitability margins will be negatively
impacted. If we pass the increase in VAT on to our customers by raising the prices of the products that we sell,
the demand for such products may decline, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
position and results of operations. The announcement of a future decrease in VAT rates may also adversely
affect our results as customers could delay making purchases until the decrease in VAT has occurred.
Furthermore, we face VAT risks arising out of the operating activities in the normal course of business and
typical acquisition-related VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations.

Any imposition of tax liability, adverse tax rulings or the result of tax audits could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

_Compliance breaches could result in investigations by the relevant authorities, fines, additional payments of_
_tax, damage claims, payment claims, the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers and_
_reputational damage._

As of December 31, 2020, we operated in 26 European countries with over 2,300 stores (including
141 franchised stores) in 20 countries and online shops in 24 countries. We had an average number of
employees of 21,016 (salaried employees and excluding apprentices) in the financial year 2019/2020.
Although we mainly operate within the European Union, some countries may have less stable political, legal
and regulatory regimes, as well as inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations. Moreover, we have
limited influence over the day-to-day operations of our franchised stores (primarily in France), as well as our

###### 70


-----

suppliers. This inherently creates a risk that applicable legislation and regulations may be breached. Such
behavior could lead to further legal proceedings against us, fines, sanctions, additional tax liability, court
orders affecting future conduct, forfeiture of profits, rescission of existing contracts, exclusion from certain
businesses, loss of trade licenses or other restrictions, which, in turn, might limit our ability to pursue strategic
projects and transactions that may be important for the business and which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

There is a risk that our employees may not act in compliance with applicable statutory provisions
(including antitrust regulation, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption legislation as well as data protection
laws) and internal guidelines or may commit fraud, theft or abuse of our resources including misappropriate of
loyalty points and gift vouchers. As a result, we may face the risk that penalties or liabilities may be imposed on
us, or our business may be adversely affected as a result of such non-compliance. Thus, our corporate
governance system and monitoring capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent violations of any applicable
legal provisions, and our internal guidelines, such as the separation of duties, our “4-eyes-principle” or the
specification of duties and responsibilities, may not be able to identify past violations or prevent damages from
fraud or similar crimes within the Group.

Furthermore, involvement in potential non-compliance proceedings and investigations could harm
our reputation and that of our management, lead to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on
efforts to compete for new customers. Customers and/or third parties could also initiate legal proceedings
against us for substantial financial sums.

The realization of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

Risks Related to our Financing

_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_
_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._

We currently have, and after the Transaction (including the issuance of the Notes) will have, a
significant amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2020,
after giving effect to the Transaction and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had
external borrowings of €2,382.1 million, including €600 million drawn under the Term Loan B Facility. The
terms of each of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will allow us to incur substantial
additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to €170.0 million under the
Revolving Credit Facility. The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could
have important consequences to holders of the Notes in this offering, including, but not limited to:

    - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow
to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development or other general corporate purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged; and

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future to fund future
operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and increasing the cost of
any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

###### 71


-----

_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_
_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._

Each of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will restrict, among
other things, our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of
TopCo or its restricted subsidiaries (in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) and the
shares of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer, TopCo or the restricted subsidiaries (in respect of the Senior
PIK Notes Indenture);

    - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

    - make certain investments;

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the applicable Issuer;

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

    - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the relevant Notes.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement. In particular, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement requires us to maintain a
specified financial ratio if cash drawings under the revolving credit facility are more than 40% of the total
revolving credit facility commitments on a financial quarter end date. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can
be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of any of
those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under our Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under our Senior Secured Facilities, subject to
applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could
cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured
Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default or acceleration
under the Senior Secured Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indentures. If our
creditors, including the creditors under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of
those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to
repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable
and to make payments to enable us to repay the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, in full or in part.
In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to sustain_
_our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the
Senior Secured Facilities and our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior PIK Notes, and to
fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which,
to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other
factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. Our
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement provides for a term loan facility which will mature in 2026. The Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior PIK Notes will mature in 2026. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes.” At the_
maturity of these loans, the Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows
from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or

###### 72


-----

we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required
to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such
refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities or capital
expenditures, sell assets or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The
type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in
the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a
timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such
time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to
comply with more-onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of
existing or future debt instruments, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and each of the Indentures may
restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative
financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or
acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on
commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the
Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or
cross-acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay
all our debts, including the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior PIK Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
debt. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.
The terms of our debt, including under the Indentures, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not
be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds
of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet our
debt service obligations then due. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior PIK Notes, the Indentures, and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement limit, or will limit, and any future
debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_
_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our_
_businesses._

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be
structurally senior to the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. In
addition, such debt could be incurred on a basis senior to the guarantees of the Senior PIK Notes. Although the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under
certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that
we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior Secured Facilities and the Indentures will not prevent us
from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

_The loans under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement bear interest at floating rates that could rise_
_significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._

The loans under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement bear interest at floating rates of interest per
annum equal to LIBOR or EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. These
interest rates could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into certain interest rate hedging
arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to
be available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly,
our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

_Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR and LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect the_
_interest paid on the Senior Secured Facilities._

The Senior Secured Facilities will bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR or LIBOR
(depending on whether a loan under those facilities is denominated in euro or sterling), which are deemed to
be “benchmarks” and have been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and
proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented.
These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or
have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

###### 73


-----

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional
provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a
benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it
(i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an
equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised
entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed
equivalent or recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Secured Facilities if the
methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the
Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or
otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of
the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could
increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and
complying with any such regulations or requirements.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority announced on March 5, 2021, that the publication of LIBOR will
cease with effect from December 31, 2021, and it will cease to compel panel banks to submit LIBOR
submissions. Separately, the euro risk free-rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding
principles and high-level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro
denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among
other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions)
may increase the risk to the euro area financial system.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will
continue to be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the
past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation)
the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer
or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark;
and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other
consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact
on the interest we pay on borrowings under the Senior Secured Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were
to increase significantly, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.

_Any interest rate hedging agreements that we enter into may expose us to counterparty risks and potential_
_losses if our counterparties fall into bankruptcy._

We may enter into interest rate hedging agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Senior Secured Facilities. Under any such agreements, we
would be exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into
bankruptcy, claims we have under any such swap agreements may become worthless. In addition, in the event
that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging agreements, we may be required to make
termination payments, which would result in a loss.

Risks Related to the Notes

_Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions_
_regarding the collateral._

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the same collateral securing our obligations under our
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations, other than security provided by
subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated in France and Italy, which will only secure the
Senior Secured Facilities. Furthermore, under the terms of the Indentures and Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be
secured by the same collateral.

_Prior to the Term Loan Refinancing Date_

Prior to the date upon which any outstanding term facility indebtedness under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement and any second lien facility agreement is repaid in full and the only loan financing we have
outstanding is revolving facility debt (including the Revolving Credit Facility) (the “Term Loan Refinancing
Date”) and subject to certain limited exceptions, the Security Agent will act with respect to the collateral only at
the direction of a simple majority of more than 50% of our senior secured creditors (including, for this purpose,
both drawn and undrawn uncancelled commitments under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, debt in

###### 74


-----

respect of certain hedging obligations and debt under the Senior Secured Notes but excluding cash
management providers). Upon issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement will, together, hold a higher percentage of the total senior secured credit participations
than the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, we will be able to incur significant additional
indebtedness and other obligations (including hedging obligations) that may be secured by the same
collateral, and, following the incurrence of such additional indebtedness, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes may further be diluted in relation to being able to control enforcement of the collateral. If the majority
senior secured creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease
enforcing, the transaction security then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second
lien creditor participations may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

The holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the collateral. As a
result, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of
collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security
Documents, if any amounts under any other senior secured debt (including, for this purpose, both drawn and
undrawn uncancelled commitments under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, debt in respect of certain
hedging obligations and debt under the Senior Secured Notes but excluding cash management providers)
remain outstanding in an amount equal to or greater than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the total
senior secured debt.

Disputes may occur between the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and creditors under our Senior
Secured Facilities (and/or other secured creditors) as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement
remedies and strategies with respect to the collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will be bound by any decision of the Instructing Group (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing
_Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement—Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Senior Secured_
_Noteholders”) which may result in enforcement action in respect of the collateral, whether or not such action is_
approved by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The creditors under
our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (and any of our other secured creditors) may have interests that are
different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies
under the Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells collateral (other than collateral that only secures the Senior PIK
Notes) as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—_
_Security—Release of Liens”)._

Furthermore, the Intercreditor Agreement includes “snooze/lose” provisions pursuant to which, if the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes fail to respond to a request for consent in relation to any of the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, or a request to participate in any other vote or approve any other action under
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, or fails to provide details of its senior secured credit participations to
the Security Agent (or any other confirmation or notification) within the timescale specified by the Security
Agent, its credit participation may be deemed zero, or its vote may be disregarded.

_On and After the Term Loan Refinancing Date_

On and after the Term Loan Refinancing Date, in general, the creditor representatives representing
the Senior Creditors (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement”)
whose senior credit participations (representing, on and after the Term Loan Refinancing Date, liabilities with
super priority status) aggregate more than 50% of the total senior credit participations (being the Majority
Senior Creditors (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement—
_Restrictions on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Senior Secured Noteholders”) and the creditor representatives_
representing the Senior Secured Noteholders and Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties (each as defined in
“Description of Certain Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement—Restrictions on Enforcement: Senior
_Lenders and Senior Secured Noteholders”) whose pari passu credit participations aggregate more than 50% of_
the total Pari Passu Credit Participations at that time (being the “Majority Pari Passu Creditors” as defined in
“Description of Certain Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement—Restrictions on Enforcement: Senior
_Lenders and Senior Secured Noteholders”)), may provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent to_
enforce the collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in general, the instructions of the Majority Pari Passu
Creditors will prevail. However, if (i) within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the
Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either: (A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they
wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue or (B) appointed a Financial Adviser to assist them in making such

###### 75


-----

a determination; or (ii) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice; or (iii) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either: (A) made a determination as to the
method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue or (B) appointed a Financial Adviser to
assist them in making such a determination, and in either case, the Majority Senior Creditors determine in good
faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realized proceeds of enforcement and
deliver enforcement instructions to the Security Agent which they reasonably believe are necessary or advisable
in enhancing the prospects of achieving a prompt and expeditious realization of the value of the collateral; or
(iv) an Insolvency Event is continuing with respect to a Debtor (each as defined in “Description of Certain
_Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement—Restrictions on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Senior_
_Secured Noteholders”), then the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received_
from the Majority Senior Creditors until the occurrence of the Super Senior Discharge Date.

During the period on and after the Term Loan Refinancing Date, the Senior Creditors (as defined in
“Description of Certain Financing Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement”) shall receive proceeds from the
enforcement of collateral and certain distressed disposals of assets in priority to holders of the Senior Secured
Notes and may otherwise have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. As a result, the Senior Creditors may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to
pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time or in a manner that would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, as the Intercreditor Agreement provides that following the Term Loan Refinancing Date
the Security Agent may be instructed by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (which encompasses holders of over
50% of the aggregate credit participation of the Senior Secured Notes and other pari passu debt as well as
certain hedging liabilities), holders of incremental pari passu debt may have a significant influence on the
outcome of such instructions under the Intercreditor Agreement and such creditors may have interests that are
different from the interest of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Transactions—Intercreditor Agreement.”. If the majority senior creditors and/or Majority Pari Passu Creditors do_
not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing, the transaction
security then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien creditor participations
may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

In any such a situation, your ability to recover on the Senior Secured Notes could be materially
impaired.

_Certain debt that we incur in the future may be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the collateral_
_securing the Senior Secured Notes in priority to the Senior Secured Notes._

The Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement will permit, (i) debt incurred in connection with a
government support scheme or other state-backed financing arrangement up to a certain limit and (ii) following
a complete refinancing of the term loans under the Senior Secured Facilities, any term loans incurred under any
other senior secured facilities agreement and any term loans incurred under any second lien facilities
agreement, certain debt incurred under the Senior Secured Facilities or other senior secured credit facilities,
hedging obligations and cash management obligations to be designated as “super priority”. Any such super
priority debt would be secured by the same property and assets that secure the Senior Secured Notes. However,
the liabilities under such super priority debt would have priority over amounts received from the sale of the
collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an enforcement sale of such collateral. As such, in the
event of enforcement of such collateral, you may not be able to recover on the collateral if the then-outstanding
liabilities under such super priority debt are greater than the proceeds realized in such enforcement sale.

_The collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by security
interests in the collateral described in this offering memorandum, which collateral also secures the obligations
under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, certain hedging and cash management obligations and, with
respect to certain limited collateral, the Senior PIK Notes (on a second-priority basis). In addition, the Senior PIK
Notes will be secured by the Senior PIK Notes Only Collateral, comprised of a first-security interest over the
issued share capital of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and any intercompany receivables owed by the Senior PIK
Notes Issuer to LuxCo 3. Thus, most of our assets will not secure the Senior PIK Notes. The collateral may also
secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the
Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the collateral may be diluted by any increase in the
first-priority debt secured by the collateral or a reduction of the collateral securing the Notes.

The value of the collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale,

###### 76


-----

economic conditions where operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the
collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the
collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you
that there will be a market for the sale of the collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a
substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is
subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The collateral is located in more than one country, and the
multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the collateral may limit the realizable value of the collateral. For
example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be
materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings.

_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes._

The collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted
by other creditors that have the benefit of priority security interests in the collateral securing the Notes from
time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions,
defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing
the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. Furthermore, the
ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, under German law, the enforcement of a
share pledge is subject to certain specific requirements according to German law. The Security Agent may also
need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot
assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the
consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly,
the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the collateral may
decline significantly.

Furthermore, the security interests may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement or may be
limited by applicable law or may be subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity or enforceability. In
addition, while the relevant determination is complex and dependent on the facts and circumstances at the
time of an insolvency, it is possible that the Proceeds Loan could be subject to equitable subordination risks
under German insolvency law. Generally, under German mandatory law, the granting and enforcement of
security and/or guarantees which secure indebtedness of a direct or indirect shareholder of a security grantor
incorporated in Germany or of a subsidiary of any such shareholder in order to ensure the maintenance of
share capital of a joint stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung) or a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited liability company as_
general partner is subject to certain statutory limitations. As a consequence, customary provisions are included
in the Indentures, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement which limit the
enforceability of the respective guarantees (and corresponding security interests securing the relevant security
provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantees) addressing these statutory limitations and liability risks
pursuant to section 43 paragraph 3 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz betreffend die
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbHG) or section 93 paragraph 3 number 6 of German Stock_
Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz—AktG).

You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges over shares of
French companies by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the collateral consisting of shares rather than by a
sale of such collateral in a public auction. Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment
obligations, may only be enforced following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount
which is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction
(the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure
(attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the
pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the
pledged assets.

Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and
therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. If the secured creditors chose
to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured

###### 77


-----

liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed assets. Such value is determined
either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context
of a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding a judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) or a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire), an expert is appointed to value the pledged assets_
and if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be
required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the pledged collateral and
the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by
the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets. Should
a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an enforcement
of the pledged assets could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. Since
such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is
possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of our group as a going
concern.

The enforcement of the Italian share pledge may also be subject to practical difficulties and/or delays
(e.g., in relation to the endorsement of the relevant share certificates to any potential purchaser of the pledged
shares lacking a sufficient co-operation by the pledgor and/or a director of the Italian company whose shares
are pledged) and the risk of challenges during the sale process.

_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the_
_incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_
_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior PIK Notes, as applicable, may create hardening or voidance periods for such Note Guarantees and
security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted
debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, because the Indentures permit
the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, as
applicable, in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable
hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted, perfected, amended, confirmed, or recreated. At each such time, if the security
interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance
period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of
further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable. In addition, we intend to implement the
Senior PIK Issuer Reorganization after the Issue Date and upon completion of the Post-Closing Mergers, which
contemplates, among other steps, that KB A will replace LuxCo 3 as the new direct parent of the Senior PIK
Notes Issuer and TopCo and subsequently, that the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will replace KB A as the new direct
parent of TopCo. In connection with such steps, any security granted over the shares of the Senior PIK Notes
Issuer and TopCo, as applicable, in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior PIK Notes, as applicable,
may be released and retaken and thus may be subject to new hardening periods.

_The security interests in the collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_
_of the Notes and certain collateral will be granted subsequent to the issuance of the Notes. The ability of the_
_Security Agent to enforce certain of the collateral may be restricted by local law._

The security interests in the collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indentures will provide (along with the
Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a
consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the collateral securing the Notes, except through the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or the Senior PIK Notes Trustee, as the case may be, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of
the applicable Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the collateral.

With respect to certain jurisdictions, including Germany (including, without limitation, with respect to
accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheiten)), Poland and the Netherlands (with respect to the pledge of
shares), due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of certain security

###### 78


-----

interests and enforceability of such security interests, the collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt”
obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the
obligations under the Notes directly (a “Parallel Debt”). The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at
the same time as the obligations of the applicable Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge
the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt will discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a
claim against the applicable Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions and we cannot assure
you that it will be recognized or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of the
pledge. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

Furthermore, with respect to accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheiten) governed by German law
such as pledges over shares, partnership interests, receivables or bank accounts, the application of the future
pledgee concept, whereby the Security Agent accepts a pledge not only as a representative of the current
creditors, but also for future, yet unknown creditors for them to benefit from security interests created at an
earlier point in time without the need to confirm the Collateral has not yet been tested in court and there are
legal risks as to whether the application of such concept can validly ensure the creation of such (prior-ranking)
security interests. Especially with respect to pledges over shares, the validity of which requires notarization
under German law, some academics and public notaries reject the concept of the Security Agent representing
future, yet unknown creditors or question at least the timing as to when such collateral is perfected.

In respect of the Security Documents governed by French law it should be noted that none of the
Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French courts and to the
extent that the Notes or security interests created under the Parallel Debt and/or trust constructs are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an
enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will
bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as beneficiary of the
Parallel Debt. There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel
Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 no. 10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation
governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially
the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular,
the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering
that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was
made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of
the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and
academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no
assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted
that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to
generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this
matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French
law.

In respect of the share pledge governed by Italian law, there is some uncertainty on the validity of
security interests created in favour of an entity acting as trustee for the creditors or under “parallel debt”
arrangements. Parallel Debt provisions would generally be deemed not applicable and the share pledge is
created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as agent (“mandatario con
_rappresentanza”) of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of the Notes. Therefore, considering_
that the holders of the Notes (i) are not expected to be direct parties to the relevant Italian law governed
Security Document, (ii) may not be specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registers and (iii) may change over time without any share pledge confirmation
and extension deed being entered into from time to time, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that
the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Italian law
governed share pledge and/or cannot enforce that security.

To the extent that the security interests in the collateral created under the Parallel Debt construction
are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis
any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com.
September 13, 2011 no 10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the
laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in

###### 79


-----

France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague
Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition (the “Trust Convention”), so
that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

_Certain categories of property are excluded from the collateral and certain of our subsidiaries that provide_
_guarantees and collateral for the benefit of the lenders under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement will not_
_provide such support for the benefit of the holders of the Notes._

Certain categories of assets are excluded from the collateral securing the Notes and the related
Guarantees. For example, assets need only be pledged to the extent permitted by applicable law and if the
cost to us of providing a security interest (or the perfection thereof) is proportionate to the benefit accruing to
the holders of the Notes and other secured creditors. Asset security (other than certain intercompany loan
receivables and bank account pledges) and the shares and assets of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries are not
part of the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries that provide guarantees and
collateral for the benefit of the lenders under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement will not provide such
support for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Notes will be
effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness that is secured by property and assets that do
not secure the Notes on an equal basis to the extent of the value of such property and assets.

_Noteholders must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor Agreement to implement parity among the_
_secured parties._

In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, the Netherlands and Germany, due to the laws and
other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of certain security interests and enforceability of
such security interests, the collateral will secure so-called “parallel debt” obligations created under the
Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the obligations under the Notes
directly. Finally, while our subsidiaries incorporated in France and Italy will provided guarantees and security
for the benefit of the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, they will not provide any such
credit support for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In these cases, the parity of the Senior
Secured Notes and the other obligations secured by senior-ranking security over the assets which are also
subject to the collateral and the (indirect) right in the security interests will be implemented by way of the
Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, the noteholders need to rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor
Agreement to receive the benefit of the security interests and to implement parity among the noteholders and
the other pari passu secured creditors. In the event that the Intercreditor Agreement does not relay the benefit
of the security interests to the noteholders or does not ensure parity among the pari passu secured creditors
on a contractual basis, the proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral will be applied first to the other
obligations secured by senior-ranking security over the assets and may not be sufficient or not be applied pari
_passu to the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

_The rights of holders of the Senior PIK Notes to enforce remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral are_
_limited as long as any senior secured debt is outstanding._

The security interests in the Shared Collateral securing the Senior PIK Notes and each Senior PIK Notes
Guarantee granted by TopCo and any of its subsidiaries will rank behind the first-priority security interests in
such collateral in favor of the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured
Notes, any additional senior secured creditors and in favor of institutions with whom we enter into certain
hedging and cash management arrangements, any second lien facilities agreement we may enter into or any
second lien notes we may issue. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent will serve
as the Security Agent for the secured parties under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Senior
Secured Notes, any second lien facility agreement, any second lien notes, the Senior PIK Notes and certain
hedging and cash management arrangements and will (subject to certain limited exceptions) act with respect
to such collateral only at the direction of the relevant instructing group of creditors under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, holders of the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging counterparties until amounts
outstanding under such debt instruments are paid in full and discharged. Once these amounts have been fully
paid and discharged, if any second lien facility agreement has been entered into or second lien notes have
been issued by a member of the Restricted Group, the common security agent will, subject to certain
exceptions, act at the direction of the relevant instructing group of creditors under such second lien facility
agreement and/or holders of the second lien notes until amounts outstanding under such instruments have
been paid in full and discharged. Until the expiration of a standstill period on enforcement of such security on
behalf of holders of the Senior PIK Notes, first, the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging counterparties will have; and second, if any second lien facility
agreement has been entered into or second lien notes have been issued, the creditors under the second lien
facility agreement and second lien notes will have (in each case subject to certain limited exceptions) the
exclusive right to make all decisions with respect to the exercise of remedies relating to such collateral. See

###### 80


-----

“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” As a result, the holders of the Senior
PIK Notes will not be able to force a sale of such collateral, or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of
a secured creditor under the relevant security documents until the expiration of the applicable standstill period
for so long as any amounts under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, certain of our hedging and cash
management arrangements, the Senior Secured Notes, any second lien facility agreement and any second lien
notes remain outstanding. The creditors under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, certain hedging and
cash management counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the creditors under any second
lien facility agreement and the holders of any second lien notes may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Senior PIK Notes, and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security
Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior PIK Notes to do so. The
holders of the Senior PIK Notes may be required to take certain action in respect of the insolvency and
pre-insolvency or similar proceedings on the instructions of an instructing group and/or the security agent in
respect of matters relating to the Shared Collateral. This may affect the ability of holders of the Senior PIK Notes
to recover under the collateral if the proceeds from the collateral, after having satisfied obligations under our
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, certain of our hedging and cash management arrangements and the
Senior Secured Notes and any other senior secured debt outstanding at the relevant time, any second lien
facility and any second lien notes are less than the aggregate amount owed in respect of the Senior PIK Notes.
In addition, if the creditors or the agent under our Senior Secured Facilities, certain hedging counterparties or
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or any other senior secured debt outstanding at the relevant time and/
or, subject to the terms of enforcement under the Intercreditor Agreement, if any second lien facility
agreement has been entered into or any second lien notes have been issued, the creditors under any second
lien facility agreement and/or second lien notes cause the sale of the shares of the TopCo or the shares of any
of its subsidiaries through an enforcement of their first-priority security interest, in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior PIK Notes Guarantees granted by TopCo and any of its subsidiaries
and the liens over any other assets securing the Senior PIK Notes and each such Senior PIK Notes Guarantee
may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

_The ability of holders of Senior PIK Notes to recover under the pledge of the shares of TopCo and other_
_security interests may be limited._

On the Issue Date, the obligations under the Senior PIK Notes and the Senior PIK Notes Guarantees
will be secured by (i) a first-priority security interest over the “Senior PIK Notes Only Collateral” and (ii) a
second-priority pledge over the Shared Collateral (including a pledge over the shares of TopCo). First-priority
security interests over the Shared Collateral will be granted for the benefit of creditors in respect of Senior
Secured Liabilities and second priority security interests over the Shared Collateral will be granted for the
benefit of any creditors of any second lien liabilities, which in effect would cause holders of the Senior PIK
Notes to receive proceeds realized from any enforcement of the Shared Collateral and any distressed disposals
in respect of such Shared Collateral after creditors of such second lien liabilities. As a result, holders of the
Senior PIK Notes may not be able to recover on the shares and other Shared Collateral that are also pledged or
assigned as security for the Senior Secured Liabilities and/or the second lien liabilities because the creditors in
respect thereof will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such pledges and
other Shared Collateral and any distressed disposal with respect to such collateral, and the holders of the
Senior PIK Notes will need to share any remaining proceeds from such enforcement with any other secured
creditor ranking pari passu with the Senior PIK Notes. If the proceeds realized from the enforcement of such
pledges or such sale or sales exceed the Senior Secured Liabilities and any second lien liabilities, any excess
amount of such proceeds will be paid to the Senior PIK Notes Trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the
Senior PIK Notes, provided that such proceeds need to be shared with any other secured creditors ranking pari
_passu with the Senior PIK Notes. If there are no excess proceeds, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is_
less than the aggregate amount of the obligations under the Senior PIK Notes, the holders of Senior PIK Notes
will not fully recover (if at all) under such collateral.

In addition, the collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to
us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other collateral or that,
if such market does exist, there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. The shares of TopCo may also
have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to TopCo
because all of the obligations of TopCo (subject to the release mechanism in the Intercreditor Agreement)
(including the Senior PIK Notes Guarantees) must be satisfied prior to distribution to the TopCo’s equity
holders. As a result, the holders of the Senior PIK Notes may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale of shares pledged in TopCo. In addition, the value of this collateral may fluctuate over time.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior PIK Notes Trustee and holders of the Senior PIK
Notes will (subject to certain limited exceptions) not be able to force a sale of the shared collateral securing the
Senior PIK Notes or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security
Documents relating to such Collateral for so long as any Senior Secured Liabilities and/or second lien liabilities

remain outstanding and, if the creditors in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and/or the second lien
liabilities enforce their security, they will have priority over the holders of the Senior PIK Notes with respect to
the proceeds from this collateral. See “—The rights of holders of the Senior PIK Notes to enforce remedies with
_respect to the Shared Collateral are limited as long as any senior secured debt is outstanding.” As such, holders_
of the Senior PIK Notes may not be able to recover on the collateral if the claims of the creditors in respect of
the Senior Secured Liabilities and/or the second lien liabilities are greater than the proceeds realized from any
enforcement of the collateral. In addition, if the creditors or the agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
under the Senior Secured Facilities, any Senior Debt, or the Senior Secured Notes (as applicable) or any
creditors or the agent under any second lien facility agreement and/or second lien notes direct the sale of
TopCo’s shares through an enforcement of their first-priority security interest in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the second-priority security interest over such shares securing the Senior PIK Notes
and the Senior PIK Notes Guarantees may (subject to certain conditions) be automatically released. See
“Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

_The Senior PIK Notes Guarantees granted by TopCo and its subsidiaries will be subordinated to the existing_
_and future senior debt of the Guarantors of the Senior PIK Notes and the Senior PIK Notes are subject to_
_restrictions on payment and enforcement._

The Senior PIK Notes Guarantees granted by TopCo and its subsidiaries will be senior subordinated
obligations of the Guarantors of the Senior PIK Notes and will:

    - be subordinated in right of payment to all of such Guarantors’ existing and future senior
indebtedness, including any indebtedness under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes and any hedging and cash management obligations in respect thereof, any
second lien facility agreement and any second lien notes which may be issued in the future;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness
of the Guarantors;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantors that is
expressly subordinated to the Senior PIK Notes; and

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantors that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior PIK Notes, to the extent of the value of
the property or assets securing such indebtedness.

In addition, no enforcement action with respect to the Senior PIK Notes Guarantees granted by TopCo
and its subsidiaries (or any future senior subordinated guarantee of the Senior PIK Notes, if any) or any shared
collateral granted in support of the Senior PIK Notes may be taken unless (subject to certain limited
exceptions): (i) any enforcement action has been taken with respect to senior debt or the second lien debt
(provided the Senior PIK Notes Trustee and holders of the Senior PIK Notes will be limited to taking the same
action); (ii) with respect to any enforcement action on a Guarantor, an insolvency event has occurred with
respect to such Guarantor; (iii) there is a default on the Senior PIK Notes outstanding after a period of 179 days
after the date on which the agent and/or Senior Secured Notes Trustee with respect to senior debt and the
agent and/or second lien notes trustee with respect to second lien debt received written notice of such default;
(iv) the senior secured creditors and the second lien creditors have given their consent to the proposed action.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement contains significant restrictions with respect to payments of
the Senior PIK Notes, including payments by the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and any proceeds loan related
thereto. If (i) there is a payment default under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured
Notes, any other senior facilities agreement or senior secured notes (if any) or any second lien facility
agreement (if any) or second lien notes (if any), or if (ii) a payment stop notice is issued following an event of
default other than non-payment under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, any
other senior facilities agreement or senior secured notes (if any), any second lien facility (if any) or any second
lien notes (if any), then payments will not be permitted to be made in respect of the Senior PIK Notes, in the
case of (i) while that payment default is continuing and, in the case of (ii) until the expiration of the applicable
payment stop notice. In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on the Senior PIK
Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders would be required to turn over such payments to the
Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the holders of the Senior PIK Notes are generally
entitled to enforce their claims against the Senior PIK Notes Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture, nevertheless the Intercreditor Agreement places certain limits on enforcement. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

_Claims of our secured creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of unsecured_
_creditors, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._

Claims of our secured creditors will have priority with respect to the assets securing their
indebtedness over the claims of our unsecured creditors. Not all the assets that will secure our Senior Secured
Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes (and any second lien debt, if any) will secure the Senior PIK Notes,
including the pledges of shares of certain of our subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes, certain bank accounts
and certain intercompany debt. Accordingly, each Senior PIK Notes Guarantee will be effectively subordinated
to that Guarantor’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured
Notes and any other indebtedness and obligations of the relevant Guarantor of the Senior PIK Notes that is
secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior PIK Notes to the extent of the value of such assets. In the
event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any Guarantor of the Senior PIK Notes that has any such secured
obligations, holders of such secured indebtedness will have prior claims to the assets of such Guarantor that
constitute their collateral. To the extent the assets securing the Senior PIK Notes are not sufficient to repay all
amounts owing in respect thereof, subject to the limitations referred to under the caption “—Risks Related to
_Our Structure—Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_
_and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability,”_
the holders of the Senior PIK Notes will participate ratably with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of
the relevant Guarantor of the Senior PIK Notes (other than indebtedness to which the Senior PIK Notes
Guarantees have been expressly subordinated), and, with all of their other general creditors, based upon the
respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the relevant Guarantor of the
Senior PIK Notes. In the event that any of the indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor of the Senior PIK Notes
that is secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior PIK Notes becomes due or the creditors thereunder
proceed against the operating assets that secured such indebtedness, the assets remaining after repayment of
that secured indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the relevant Senior
PIK Notes Guarantee. As a result, holders of Senior PIK Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured
indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor of the Senior PIK Notes.

_Enforcement of the Note Guarantees and collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._

The Note Guarantees and the collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions.
The rights under the Note Guarantees and the collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the respective
jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and
other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for
creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The
application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law
should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce guarantees or security and to realize any recovery
under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the collateral. A summary description of certain aspects of the
insolvency laws of Germany and certain jurisdictions where the providers of collateral are organized or have
their center of main activities are set out in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or offer to purchase the applicable Notes, each Issuer_
_may, at its option, redeem the Notes of non-tendering holders._

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the applicable Notes, holders of not
less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes, all of the holders of Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender offer or
other offer and, accordingly, each Indenture will permit the applicable Issuer, at its option, to redeem the
remaining outstanding Notes at a price equivalent to that paid pursuant to such purchase or tender offer
(excluding any early tender premium). As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender
the Notes at a price equivalent to the lowest price paid to tendering holders, including if such price is below
par, and may not receive the return they expect to receive on the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption—General.”_

_The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with Original Issue Discount and holders may be required to_
_recognize taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a taxable year in excess of cash payments on_
_the Senior Secured Notes in the same taxable year._

The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. The Notes will be considered as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes
exceeds the issue price of the Notes by more than a de minimis amount. If the Notes are issued with OID, U.S.
holders will be required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income) generally on a constant yield
to maturity basis in advance of the receipt of the cash payment to which such income is attributable regardless

of such holders regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Tax
_Consequences—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a further discussion of the tax_
consideration with respect to the Notes.

_The Senior PIK Notes will be issued with OID and holders of the Senior PIK Notes may be required to_
_recognize taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a taxable year in excess of cash payments on_
_the Senior PIK Notes in the same taxable year._

###### Because no portion of the stated interest on the Senior PIK Notes is unconditionally payable in cash at least annually, no stated interest payments on the Senior PIK Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Senior PIK Notes will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the total payments of principal and stated interest on the Notes over their issue price. Holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income, irrespective of their regular method of tax accounting. See “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Senior PIK Notes” for a further discussion of the tax consideration with respect to the Senior PIK Notes.

_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited._

We cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely
affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause
volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent
to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any
such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the
Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair
value, if at all.

_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_
_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry
interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The nominee of the common depository for
Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal, interest
and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as principal paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants.
After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the relevant Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of
the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
relevant Notes under the relevant Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct
rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.

###### 84


-----

Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be
no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to
vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the relevant Indenture, unless and until the
relevant definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes.

_The Notes will not initially benefit from guarantees and/or collateral from certain of our subsidiaries._

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors and will be secured
by the Issue Date Collateral. On the date on which a Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior
Secured Facilities (which is required under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement to be provided no later
than (a) in respect of the German and Dutch Post- Closing Guarantors, 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) in
respect of the Polish Post-Closing Guarantors, within 90 days after the Issue Date), we will be required to take
such necessary actions so that, consistent with the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Notes will be
guaranteed by the additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior PIK Notes Guarantees (as
applicable). In addition, on the date on which such Senior Secured Notes Post-Closing Collateral secures the
Senior Secured Facilities (which is required under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement to be provided no
later than (a) in respect of German law and Dutch law governed Collateral, 30 days after the Issue Date; and
(b) in respect of Polish, Italian and French law governed Collateral, 90 days after the Issue Date), we will be
required to take such necessary actions so that, consistent with the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes will be secured by collateral granted by the Post-Closing Guarantors, which will also
secure the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement. There can, however, be no assurance that we will be
successful in procuring such guarantees and liens within the time period specified.

_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._

The Notes will be denominated and payable in Euros. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than Euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks
due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the Euro relative to the currency by
reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the Euro against the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the relevant
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on such Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._

Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the
United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors are non-residents of the
United States and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although we and the
Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S.
securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors and
executive officers. In addition, as the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries
and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable
to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the
U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions
of the federal securities laws of the United States.

It may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany or other countries
in which the Guarantors are organized, as the case may be, upon the Issuers or the Guarantors or those
persons under the Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters and the German and other relevant laws implementing such convention if such service
were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, particularly if such service violated the German
Constitution (Grundgesetz), or other applicable law. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuers
or any Guarantor or a security provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the
relevant company has assets. The noteholders should consult with their advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions
as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States. See “Service of
_Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”_

###### 85

_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and may be_
_subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any
time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a
credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating
assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financing and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes.

_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_
_may be sold._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to
register the Notes or the Note Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable
laws. See “Notice to Investors.” We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or
the Note Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so.

_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuers cannot
maintain the listing on the Exchange or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the
Issuers may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Although no assurance
is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the
Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a
holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

Risks Related to our Structure

_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes._

The interest of our shareholders could conflict with the interests of investors in the Notes, particularly if
we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The shareholders could cause us to
pursue acquisitions or divestitures and other transactions or make large dividend payments (subject to
limitations set forth in the Indenture) or other distributions or payments to them as the shareholders, even
though such transactions may involve increased risk for the holders of the Notes. In addition, the shareholders
may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours. Furthermore, no assurance can be given
that the shareholders will not sell all or any part of their respective shareholdings at any time nor that either of
them will not look to reduce their respective holding by means of a sale to a strategic investor, an equity
offering or otherwise.

In addition, in 2015, TopCo as parent entity entered into a profit and loss transfer agreement with the
Parent as subsidiary and the Parent as parent entity entered into a profit and loss transfer agreement with the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer as subsidiary. As a result of these profit and loss transfer agreements (the “PLTAs”),
TopCo became the head of the tax group for German corporate income tax (“CIT”) and trade tax (“TT”)
purposes for our Group (including TopCo). Pursuant to the PLTAs, the subsidiary must generally transfer its
entire profits to the parent entity which in turn must compensate the subsidiary for any of the subsidiary’s
losses. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of receivables owed by TopCo to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Parent, amounted to €998.4 million. While we intend, as soon as reasonably possible after the
Issue Date, to effect the Post-Closing Mergers, which upon completion, would terminate all intercompany
liabilities between TopCo, the Parent and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by operation of law, there can be no
assurances that the Post-Closing Mergers will occur. TopCo is a holding company with limited business
operations and depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries, which is comprised solely of
the Parent, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries, to meet its
obligations. While any liabilities owed by TopCo to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or the Parent arising
from the PLTAs can be settled in cash or in kind, should the Post-Closing Mergers not occur, any liabilities at
TopCo would remain and TopCo’s ability to settle such liabilities may be limited.

###### 86


-----

Should TopCo not complete the Post-Closing Mergers or otherwise settle the outstanding liabilities
arising from the PLTAs, the German tax authorities might consider the PLTAs as not effectively performed. As a
result, the tax effects of the tax group for German tax purposes would be disregarded which could result in an
additional CIT and TT liabilities.

_The Issuers are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries or other group entities to meet their obligations_
_on the Notes and the Note Guarantees._

Each of the Issuers is a company with limited business operations and each depends upon the receipt
of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries or other group entities to meet its obligations. In addition, prior to the
completion of the Senior PIK Issuer Reorganization, the only significant asset of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer is
the Proceeds Loan and thus the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will be dependent on payments from TopCo to make
any cash payments due on the Senior PIK Notes. Furthermore, TopCo is a holding company that conducts no
independent business operations and is thus in turn dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its
own subsidiaries to meet its obligations. It is the current intention to implement the Senior PIK Issuer
Reorganization after the Issue Date, which, upon completion, will result in the Senior PIK Notes Issuer
becoming the direct parent of TopCo. However, there can be no assurances that the Senior PIK Issuer
Reorganization will be completed. Any failure to complete the Senior PIK Issuer Reorganization could lead to
the Senior PIK Notes Issuer continuing to be a subsidiary of Luxco 3 with no subsidiaries and no significant
assets other than the Proceeds Loan, which may adversely affect the ability of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer to
meet its obligations on the Senior PIK Notes.

We intend to provide funds to the Senior Secured Issuer in order to meet the obligations on the
Senior Secured Notes through a combination of payments under profit and loss pooling agreements,
distributions and intercompany loans. If the payments under profit and loss pooling agreements, distributions
and intercompany loans do not lead to sufficient cash payments to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make
scheduled payments on the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to make payments
may be limited and depend on factors beyond its control.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the
ability of subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be
permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests or as loans or as payments under profit
and loss pooling agreements, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to the
amount of distributable current profit or distributable reserves available to them. Under German law, all
dividends may only be distributed out of distributable current profits and distributable reserves, and interim
dividend distributions are only possible to a limited extent under German law, subject to strict conditions. The
subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make
payments with respect to either series of the Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean
that, even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may
not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in
their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

_The Senior PIK Notes Issuer will have the discretion to pay interest on the Senior PIK Notes in PIK interest_
_rather than cash for any interest period._

For any interest period, the Senior PIK Notes Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, not to pay interest
on the Senior PIK Notes in cash. In the event that the Senior PIK Notes Issuer elects not to pay cash interest, the
Senior PIK Notes Issuer will pay interest on the Senior PIK Notes by increasing the principal amount of the
global Senior PIK Notes or by issuing additional Senior PIK Notes as PIK interest. See “Description of the Senior
_PIK Notes—Interest.” Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will elect to pay cash_
interest. As a result, holders of the Senior PIK Notes could potentially receive no cash interest on the Senior PIK
Notes for any interest period. The payment of PIK interest will increase the amount of the Senior PIK Notes
Issuer’s outstanding indebtedness and will accordingly increase the risks associated with the Senior PIK Notes
Issuer’s level of indebtedness.

_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing_
_the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_
_relevant Trustee._

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees and the collateral securing the Notes will be
released automatically, including, without limitation:

    - as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Amendments and Waivers” and
“Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Amendments and Waivers”:

    - in the case of collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition of property or assets
constituting collateral (as applicable), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the
“Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” covenant or other applicable provisions
under the applicable Indenture;

    - in certain circumstances in connection with the transfer of the property or assets to a Restricted
Subsidiary;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or defeasance or
discharge of the Notes, as provided under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Defeasance”,
“Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Defeasance”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Satisfaction and Discharge” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

    - if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory
security interest created pursuant to a security document governed by German law might be
released as a matter of German law;

    - in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown as described under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes— IPO Debt Pushdown”; and_

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an
enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the Note Guarantees or security interests in the collateral
unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

    - for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash or, where the Security Agent
acting reasonably determines that the cash consideration payable under the highest of the bona
fide and fully committed offers is less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, non-cash
consideration may take the form of the Senior Secured Creditors (or any of them acting alone or
together) bidding by the appropriate mechanic all or part of their Senior Secured Liabilities such
that the Senior Secured Liabilities would, on completion, be discharged to the extent of an
amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors; ;

    - (subject to exceptions including if there are no bona fide fully committed cash bids in excess of
the Senior Secured Liabilities) to the extent there is a release of Note Guarantees or security
granted for the benefit of the holders of Senior Secured Notes, concurrently with the discharge or
release of the indebtedness of the disposed entities, including the creditors under the Senior
Secured Facilities and holders of the Senior Secured Notes; and

    - pursuant to a public auction or a competitive sale process which may (but does not have to be)
approved or supervised by a court in which the Senior Unsecured Creditors are (subject to
applicable law) entitled to participate as bidders or financiers, or if a fairness opinion has been
obtained from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm selected by the
Security Agent (or, if it is not practicable for the Security Agent to appoint any such bank or form
on commercially reasonable terms, another third party professional firm which is regularly
engaged in providing valuations of the relevant type of assets).

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if upon any additional indebtedness or refinancing of
certain indebtedness, an amendment or waiver or release and re-grant of any transaction security document or
senior unsecured only security document shall only be undertaken if required by the terms or conditions of
such additional indebtedness or refinancing indebtedness or to the extent necessary under applicable law to
reflect the ranking set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and (if legally possible and not commercially
detrimental to do so and without breach of any term of the additional indebtedness or refinancing

###### 88


-----

indebtedness) where the liabilities in respect of such additional indebtedness or refinancing indebtedness are
intended to be secured, the creditors in respect of such additional indebtedness or refinancing indebtedness
shall be granted a second ranking or lesser security interest in the collateral and will nonetheless be treated
under the Intercreditor Agreement (including for the purposes of the enforcement waterfall) as secured by the
collateral pari passu with the other liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking (including any
collateral securing the Notes).

In addition, due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of
certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of security interest granted
significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can
even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive over-collateralization. While the German Federal High
Court (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case by case basis, legal authors estimate that an initial
over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured
claims by more than 50%. It is a factual question whether the security granted under the Collateral exceeds this
limit.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes.”_

_The Notes and each of the Note Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and_
_preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of
preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims under any intercompany loans
and claims by holders of the Notes under the Note Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of
our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be
entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available
for distribution to such subsidiary’s parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will each be
structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our
non-Guarantor subsidiaries for the Notes. As at and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the
sales, Adjusted EBITDA and assets of members of the Group who are not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
who are non-guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes represented 51.5%, 50.0% and 62.7% of the consolidated
sales, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated total assets of the Group, respectively.

_Your rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_
_collateral._

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security. The
liens on the collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or
the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens.

Under German law, the creation of a valid security interest under a German law governed pledge
agreement is subject to a delivery of a notice of pledge by the Security Agent or the security provider to the
pledged company or a third party (e.g., notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over bank
accounts).

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely
unable to enforce such holder’s rights in the collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in
bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. In addition, generally a
debtor may discharge its obligation under a receivable by paying the security provider until, but not after, the
debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor
of the security taker over the receivable the security provider (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since
the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a
security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which comes into force for third parties
earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) generally has priority.

_Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis and the
Senior PIK Notes on a senior subordinated basis. Each Note Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the

Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, each Indenture will provide for general
limitation language to the effect that each Note Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any
other obligation, liability or indemnification under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed or secured by the relevant Guarantor or security provider with respect to the aggregate
obligations and exposure of the Guarantor or security provider without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee
or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective or causing personal or criminal liability of the
representatives of the Guarantor or security provider under applicable law, and enforcement of each Note
Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and
defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally.

The Guarantors will be organized under the laws of Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. Although
laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could
subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security Documents and, if
payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security
Document, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, if the
court found that:

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds
under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under
applicable law;

    - the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors of the Guarantor or security provider or, in
certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security
provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest;

    - the relevant Note Guarantee was entered into without a legal obligation to do so, is prejudicial to
the interests of the other creditors and both the Guarantor and the beneficiary of the relevant
Note Guarantee were aware of or should have been aware of the fact that it was still prejudicial to
the other creditor;

    - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent
value for the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider
was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security
interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee
or Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness
beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

    - the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects
or corporate purposes of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or
for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider.

In case of a Guarantor which is a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
which is incorporated as a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) under German
law, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a
shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity or assets necessary for it to meet its
own payment obligations) would be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or a
security interest granted by such Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an
enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator may avoid
(anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and
which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance
periods.

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the insolvency
administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will
have to be returned to the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse). The administrator’s right to avoid transactions can,
depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for
the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction
(which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security or the payment of debt) detrimental
to the creditors of the debtor may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code in certain cases.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

a) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement, precautionary measures or
remedy the availability of which is subject to equitable consideration or which is otherwise at
the discretion of the Court;

b) pursuant to Article 1241 and following of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of
reciprocal obligations (“compensazione”), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may
set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have
as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

c) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions
concerning advance waivers or forfeitures;

d) claims may become barred under statutes of limitation (prescrizione or decadenza) or may be
or become subject to the defence of set-off or to counterclaim, including counterclaims
related to counterparties’ default (eccezione di inadempimento);

e) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is
prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (“colpa grave”), willful misconduct
(“dolo”) or the violation of mandatory provisions;

f) to the extent that any matter is expressed to be determined by future agreement or
negotiation, the relevant provision may be unenforceable or void by reason of its uncertainty;

g) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation; and

h) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor, other than the grantee of
such security interest, from seeking attachment or continuing enforcement or enforcement
proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant security interest.

Trust and Security Agent

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the
relevant security document. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a
security interest can be validly created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes),
which are neither directly parties to the relevant Security Documents or are not specifically identified therein or
in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; (ii) in favor of a “trustee” on the
basis that the recent Italian law provisions on “collateral agent” (as set out under Article 2414-bis of the Italian
Civil Code) do not apply to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or (iii) where the share pledge is created and
perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as (A) joint and several creditor under “parallel
debt” or similar arrangements or (B) agent (“mandatario con rappresentanza”) of the holders of the Notes,
considering that the holders of the Notes (x) are not expected to be direct parties to the relevant Italian law
governed Security Document, (y) may not be specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates
and corporate documents or public registers and (z) may change over time without any share pledge
confirmation and extension deed being entered into from time to time. Therefore, there is a risk that an Italian
court may determine that the holders of the Notes are not secured by the security under the Italian law
governed share pledge and/or cannot enforce that security.

For more information, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

_The insolvency laws of Germany and the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of the Guarantors may not be_
_as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering_
_payments due on the Notes._

_Germany_

The Issuers, TopCo and certain of its subsidiaries are organized under the laws of Germany, have their
registered offices in Germany and substantially all their assets are located in Germany (each a “German
Company”). Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Companies are likely to be
initiated in Germany and would most likely be governed by the insolvency laws of Germany.

The provisions of German insolvency law differ substantially from U.S. bankruptcy laws, including with
respect to priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the

###### 91


-----

insolvency proceedings, and hence may be less favorable to holders of the Notes than comparable provisions
of U.S. law. Thus, your ability to recover payments due on the Notes may be more limited than would be the
case under U.S. bankruptcy laws.

For holders of the Notes, the opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the German
Companies subject to the German insolvency regime include the following important consequences:

    - unless debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is granted by the court upon application by
the relevant debtor, the right to administer and to dispose of our assets generally passes to the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter);

    - also subject to the granting of debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected
by the management of any German Company after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings
are generally null and void by operation of law;

    - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings
or after that date, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires by way of enforcement a
security interest in part of the debtor’s assets that would normally form part of the insolvency
estate, such security interest becomes null and void by operation of law upon opening of the
insolvency proceedings; and

    - claims against any German Company may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules
set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

For more information, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

_Other Countries_

At least one Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and Poland. Accordingly,
law and insolvency proceedings for the respective Guarantor’s country may apply with respect to such
Guarantors. These laws may adversely affect the enforcement of your rights under the Notes and may not be as
favorable to your interests as a creditor as under U.S. bankruptcy laws.

For more information, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_
_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of_
_control provision contained in each Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain_
_important corporate events._

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Secured Notes and the Senior PIK Notes
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior PIK Notes, in each case, at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have
sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the relevant Issuer to
pay the purchase price of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, as applicable, or that
the restrictions in our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than
existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control event
may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, as applicable, pursuant to
such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The
ability of the applicable Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries or otherwise to allow them to pay cash to the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, as applicable, following the occurrence of a
change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time
when we are prohibited from providing funds to any of the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Senior
Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, as applicable, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to the purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK Notes, as applicable, or may
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings
is not obtained, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we
would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior PIK
Notes, as applicable, upon occurrence of a change of control event. We cannot assure you that we would be
able to obtain such financing.

###### 92


-----

Any failure by the relevant Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the
applicable Indenture, which would, if accelerated, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control”
and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Change of Control”.

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other
similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a
shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as
defined in the relevant Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Change of Control”, each Indenture will not_
contain provisions that would require the relevant Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indentures will include a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the relevant Issuer, TopCo and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be
a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets of the relevant Issuer, TopCo and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may
be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuers are required to make an
offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.

_In the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown, the Issuers may be replaced and certain Notes Guarantees and_
_Collateral may be released without consent and holders of the Notes may face adverse tax consequences._

In connection with a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”), we may issue a notice to the Trustees (a
“Pushdown Notice”) requiring that, among other matters, the terms of the relevant Notes Documents shall
operate with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice on the basis that references to the
relevant Issuer, TopCo and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to our Restricted
Subsidiary or Parent Entity that will or has issued shares, or whose shares are to be or were sold, pursuant to
that IPO Event (the “IPO Pushdown Entity”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, including that,
while the Senior PIK Notes remain outstanding, each reference in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the Senior PIK Notes Issuer shall be
deemed to be a reference to such IPO Pushdown Entity and each reference in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be deemed to be the direct
subsidiary of such IPO Pushdown Entity (such change in terms, an “IPO Debt Pushdown”) and the restricted
group for the purposes of the Senior PIK Notes shall consist of the IPO Pushdown Entity and its restricted
subsidiaries (the “Pushdown Group”) and the restricted group for the purposes of the Senior Secured Notes
shall consist of the direct subsidiary of the Pushdown Entity and its restricted subsidiaries. In such event, each
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, and each Guarantor, other Restricted Subsidiary or security
provider that is not a member of the Pushdown Group will be released from its obligations under the
applicable Indenture and the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, without consent of the holders of the Notes. As
a result, the covenants under the Indentures governing the Notes, including in respect of the application of
proceeds from an IPO Event of a Restricted Subsidiary, will no longer apply to such entities. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—IPO Debt Pushdown”, “Description of the Senior_
_Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”._

Such change in the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
deemed exchange of the originally issued Notes for new Notes, which would generally be treated as a taxable
exchange for such purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain
or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with OID. In such event, noteholders that are subject to U.S. federal
income tax would be required to include the OID in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income. Noteholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax should consult their
own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the
Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown. See “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a further discussion of the tax consideration with respect to the Notes._

It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other
than U.S. federal income tax purposes (including for tax purposes in other jurisdictions, e.g. Germany).

###### USE OF PROCEEDS

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes will be
€1,305 million and that the gross proceeds from the offering of the Senior PIK Notes will be €475 million.

The Issuers intend to use the proceeds from the Offering together with proceeds of €600 million from
borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the Equity
Contribution to (1) fund the redemption of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and Existing Senior Notes;
(2) repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities (including amounts outstanding
under the existing revolving credit facility); (3) fund cash on hand and (4) pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection therewith.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transaction are

made by our management.

(1) Adjustments to cash and cash equivalents include (1) estimated restructuring cash requirements of €91 million which we
expect to be realized over the next two years, (2) cash overfunding and (3) an estimated seasonal cash adjustment of
€275 million. Because of the payment terms that we have agreed with our suppliers, trade payables typically peak in
December and the cash inflow from the peak Christmas trading season typically results in peak liquidity at the end of the
calendar year. In the second quarter of our financial year, we typically experience cash outflows resulting from seasonal
payments such as payments for Christmas inventories, VAT from Christmas sales and interest payments on our Existing
Senior Secured Notes and our Existing Senior Notes. Our cash position on December 31, 2020 also benefited from an
increased level of deferred payments for income taxes and to tax authorities, landlords and other business partners. In
addition, cash flows in the second quarter of our financial year are affected by payments for income taxes, capital
expenditures and interest payments on our existing Senior Secured Facilities. The estimated seasonal cash adjustment
thus represents management estimates of cash outflow for the second quarter of the financial year 2020/2021 based on
experience in previous financial years. The adjustments to cash and cash equivalents involve significant assumptions,
have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm and are inherently
subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual cash requirements to differ materially from those
assumed in the adjustments, including as a result of an increased amount of deferred payments and cash conservation
from store closures. The actual amount of cash used may vary.

(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Secured Facilities. Includes cash utilizations of our
existing revolving credit facility and under ancillary facilities in an aggregate principal amount of €135.3 million. Does not
include non-cash utilizations in the form of rent- and similar guarantees in an aggregate principal amount of
€52.4 million.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, which will be redeemed in full on or
around the Issue Date.

(4) Aggregate principal amount.

(5) On or prior to the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will enter into the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement by
amending and restating the Existing Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, which provides for a €170 million Revolving
Credit Facility. We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn as of the Issue Date, other than the rollover of rentand similar guarantees in an aggregate principal amount of approximately €47.7 million at the end of February 2021 that
had been established or issued under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or ancillary facilities thereunder.

(6) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Notes, which will be redeemed in full on or around the
Issue Date.

(7) Represents national aid loans incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

(8) We define total financial external debt as the sum of total secured indebtedness, the Existing Senior Notes or Senior PIK
Notes, as applicable, and national aid loans incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

(9) We define total capitalization as the sum of total external financial debt and total stockholders’ equity.

Overview of the Business Activities of the Douglas Group

We believe we are the leading premium beauty platform in Europe, with total Group sales of
€3,112.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) of €250.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €235.2 million in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The majority of our sales are generated within the selective beauty
distribution channel, which requires the formal authorization of a supplier to carry a selective product, as
opposed to the mass market channel. As of December 31, 2020, we operate in 26 European countries with
over 2,300 stores (including 141 franchised stores) in 20 countries and have e-commerce operations in
24 countries. According to the OC&C Market Review Update, in 2019 we held leading market positions in the
premium beauty market (top 1-2) in all of our core markets except for Spain where we held the number
3 position. In those six core countries, we generated 90.7% of our sales in the financial year 2019/2020. In the
financial year 2019/2020, we had an average number of 21,016 employees (salaried employees and excluding
apprentices).

We believe we operate the leading online beauty platform in our core markets in Europe, with highly
integrated brick & mortar stores and e-commerce customer interfaces which provide our customers with a
comprehensive omnichannel, one-stop shopping experience. In October 2019, we launched our beauty
marketplace in Germany, where we partner with third party retailers and brands to further expand our product
assortment without having to build up inventories. As of December 31, 2020, our marketplace featured
101 partners and offered nearly 84,000 SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). Our
total e-commerce sales amounted to €1,006.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
corresponding to 32.3% of our total sales. In the financial year 2019/2020, our e-commerce sales amounted to
€821.5 million, or 25.4% of our total sales, corresponding to a CAGR of 39.3% during the financial year
2017/2018 to 2019/2020. In Germany, our e-commerce sales comprised 39.9% of our total sales in the financial
year 2019/2020.

We primarily operate under the “Douglas” brand and under the “Nocibé” brand in France and
Monaco. With nearly 130,000 different SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including additional SKUs
from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace), we offer one of the industry’s largest beauty and
personal care product assortments available across a wide range of price points in both our brick & mortar and
online stores. This assortment is complemented by a range of beauty-related nutritional supplements,
accessories such as jewelry, home decorations and selected service offerings.

We believe that we distinguish ourselves with a customer-centric sales approach, by offering our
customers high quality advice and services. As a result, we have an extensive customer loyalty card program.
As of September 30, 2020, we had more than 44 million Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card holders across
Europe. We believe that several factors make us a “must-have” distribution platform for the major suppliers of
beauty products, such as our customer base, reputation, broad, well-invested store network in prime locations,
and e-commerce capabilities.

###### 99


-----

We believe we are an innovation leader in omnichannel beauty retailing in Europe and already at the
beginning of the financial year 2017/18, we launched our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy where we put our
online business at the center of our focus with the aim of becoming an integrated, data-based beauty platform.
As part of this strategy, we have successfully modernized our brand logo and store design and continue to
make investments in e-commerce. We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and have
started to implement the next phase, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next phase, we are
focusing even more on digitalization to create an integrated beauty platform and link our brick & mortar stores
and e-commerce capabilities. In doing so, we aim to provide a more holistic journey for our customers.

Selected Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Position

We believe that the factors discussed below have significantly affected the development of our results
of operations and financial position in the period for which financial information is presented in this offering
memorandum, and that such factors will continue to have a material influence on our results of operations and
financial position in the future.

For a discussion of certain factors that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
position, see the risk factors set out in the section headed “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum.

_Development of the European Beauty Market_

Our results of operations have historically been affected by developments in the European premium
beauty market and to a certain extent by the general economic climate in the regional markets where we
operate. As a result, the principal condition currently affecting our business and results of operations is the
COVID-19 pandemic. The recent lockdowns across countries in Europe where we operate, social distancing
requirements, curfews, the continuing uncertainty of COVID-19’s trajectory and the uncertainty of the pace of
recovery and changes in customer behavior and preferences are all factors we expect will continue to impact
our business. See “—Factors Affecting Comparability—COVID-19 Pandemic” below.

The premium beauty market in many European countries has demonstrated resilience even
throughout more challenging retail trading environments, including during the European financial crisis and
partly through the COVID-19 pandemic. Beauty products (fragrances, skin & body care and also color
cosmetics) are often perceived as accessible high-value gifts and so-called “personal rewards”, which has
contributed to the demand for such products in general remaining stable historically and showing resilience
even during periods of extended economic downturns. The European beauty market in our six core markets
(Germany, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Poland) grew at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2015 and 2019
while over the same period, the premium segment of the market where we operate grew at a CAGR of 2.9%.
We believe that this development was primarily volume-driven, while growth of certain product categories like
fragrances and skincare were driven by growth in high-end brands, new launches in high tech products and
clinical ingredient products, a trend towards organic ingredients and natural beauty products. Before the
COVID-19 pandemic, our sales, including brick & mortar sales and e-commerce sales, reflected the positive
trend of the market and grew from €3,276.8 million in the financial year 2017/2018 to €3,453.5 million in the
financial year 2018/2019, partially also bolstered by our acquisition of Parfumdreams in August 2018.

In the coming years, the premium segment of the European beauty market is expected to continue to
grow. For additional information on the European premium beauty market, see “Market and Competitive
_Environment”._

_Trends towards Omnichannel Distribution and E-commerce_

We focus on total like-for-like performance on an omnichannel basis including both brick & mortar
and e-commerce. However, in accordance with our overall strategy, e-commerce has seen a particular strong
growth in recent financial years and has contributed above-average to our overall like-for-like growth. This
development was underpinned by a strong underlying growth of the online premium beauty market in our six
core markets (Germany, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Poland), which grew at a CAGR of 21%
between 2015 and 2019 and amounted to 14% of the total premium beauty market in those countries in 2019,
as well as recent improvements to our e-commerce platform.

Driven by constant changes in customer demand and shopping behavior, we have continuously
invested in omnichannel distribution capacities, including our e-commerce platform and beauty marketplace,
and have implemented organizational changes to integrate our brick & mortar and online businesses.
Although we believe we operate the leading online beauty platform in our core countries, with highly
integrated brick & mortar, online and mobile customer interfaces (which, for example, allow our customers to
browse online/mobile and buy in-store, or click & collect”), we expect such investments in e-commerce to
continue in the future.

###### 100


-----

Our online shops have been an important source of profitable growth in the past few years and our
results of operations have been positively influenced by the on-going trend towards e-commerce and
omnichannel distribution. In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed
customer behavior and further accelerated the shift towards online retailing even outside of national
lockdowns, which has in turn positively affected our e-commerce sales.

E-commerce sales are defined as the sum of all invoiced sales relating to products and services by
customer orders via websites, internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones
(so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t” sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage
with respect to a specific task using a mobile or “smart” telephone) (and, for Germany, telephone orders) after
cancellations and backorders, as well as rebates, discounts and returns, disregarding any stock transfer from
e-commerce to brick & mortar business. In the first quarter 2020/2021, our e-commerce sales amounted to
€433.4 million, corresponding to 37.0% of our total sales. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
our e-commerce sales totaled €1,006.3 million, or 32.3% of our total sales. E-commerce sales increased to
€821.5 million, corresponding to 25.4% of our overall sales in the financial year 2019/2020 from €584.1 million
(or 16.9% of our overall sales) in the financial year 2018/2019 and €423.3 million (or 12.9% of our overall sales)
in the financial year 2017/2018.

The continued growth of our e-commerce platform has been accompanied by an increase of related
variable costs, in particular cost of freight and packaging costs, which, on a relative basis, represent a larger
portion of our e-commerce cost base as compared to our brick & mortar store cost base. In addition, as part of
our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we are moving towards a One Warehouse, All Channels
(“OWAC”) approach in our supply chain management and logistics where each of our logistic facilities will
service our physical stores and e-commerce platform as well as handle partner fulfillment for our marketplace.
Our growing e-commerce business has resulted in the ratio of outbound logistic costs as a percentage of net
sales increasing slightly in the last few years.

(**) As restated

(1) E-commerce sales of the financial year 2017/2018 do not include sales from click & collect in France in the amount of
€15.6 million that are presented as brick & mortar sales.

(2) We define the number of orders as the number of customer orders placed in the financial year after cancelations and
backorders; an order is counted on the day we fulfill the order. These values are only for the countries in which we
operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(3) Sales growth (e-commerce) reflects our e-commerce sales growth, shown as a percentage change compared to the
previous period.

(4) We define the number of active customers as the sum of all customers placing at least one order per financial year for
which an invoice has been issued, whereby a customer ordering multiple times under a guest account will be counted as
multiple customers. Due to a system change, active customer data for Spain is not included in financial year 2017/2018.
These values are only for the countries in which we operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(5) We calculate site visits as the number of series of page requests from the same device and source (either via websites,
internet websites designed to be accessed via mobile or “smart” telephones (so-called “m” sites) or tablets (so-called “t”
sites), or “apps” (applications designed to optimize internet usage with respect to a specific task using a mobile or
“smart” telephone)) in the respective period as recorded via the analytics tool Webtrekk. Due to technical reasons,
tracking data for Switzerland is not included for financial year 2018/2019. These values are only for the countries in which
we operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(6) We define the average basket size per order as the total amount spent by our customers (including VAT) after
cancelations and returns divided by the number of delivered orders after cancelations in the financial year, in Germany
excluding Swiss e-commerce, Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty.

(7) We define the return rate as the ratio of the number of returned products and the number of products ordered, after
cancellations and backorders and disregarding any stock transfer from e-commerce to brick & mortar business in
Germany, excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty.

(8) We define the conversion rate as the amount of all past customer orders before returns and cancelations without
relocations in a selected period divided by the number of visits in that period. These values are only for the countries in
which we operate, excluding Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

(9) We define fulfillment costs as the sum of cost of freight, packaging material cost, as well as storage and handling cost.
Costs for our own employees in warehouses are not included. Fulfillment costs have been derived from our unaudited
management accounts. Group values are shown.

_Renovation and Optimization of our Store Network_

Our ability to increase our brick & mortar sales and our profitability depends to some extent on the
total number of stores that we operate and the profitability of each store location. Moreover, our ability to
create a holistic digital customer journey through the integration of our online shop and marketplace with our
store business, especially at our prime retail locations, at costs that allow us to maintain our target profit
margins, is a key factor to our success.

In the last three financial years, we actively managed our store portfolio, concentrating more on the
optimization, i.e., closing or replacing stores with lower profitability, primarily in South-Western Europe, with
stores in better locations as appropriate, opening flagship stores in big cities, and less on the expansion of our
store network. From October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020, we added 454 own stores to our network on a net
basis (including stores that were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Limoni and La Gardenia in Italy as well
as Bodybell and Perfumerias If in Spain and Andorra). The net increase of 454 stores resulted from 110 new
store openings, 629 store acquisitions and the closure of 285 stores. Our openings of directly operated stores
over the period primarily focused on Eastern Europe, in particular on Poland and Romania, where we had
identified certain opportunities to increase the number of stores, as well as France.

In light of the shift in customer behavior towards online retailing, which has been accelerated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, we have launched our Store Optimization Program (“SOP”). Our SOP targets closing
approximately 500 stores by the end of September 2022 across out network but with a focus on Southern
Europe, where our sales from brick & mortar stores were particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
where there is currently high overlap in store locations due to our historical acquisitions. As the announcement
of our SOP was in January 2021, the costs of closure are only partially reflected in our Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements or Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Business—
_Strategy—Complement accelerating e-commerce channel with Store Optimization Program”._

Our capital expenditures typically relate to investments in the refurbishment, maintenance, design and
re-design of existing stores and the expansion of our e-commerce business and totaled €105.4 million,
€108.6 million and €126.4 million in the financial years 2019/2020, 2018/2019 and 2017/2018, respectively.
While our capital expenditures usually remained relatively stable, such expenditures peaked in the financial
year 2017/2018 as a result of the implementation of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, which resulted in the
rejuvenation of our brand appearance, including the new Douglas logo and the further development of our
e-commerce platform and customer loyalty program.

_Growth and Value-Creation Initiatives_

In the financial year 2017/2018, we began to implement our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy with the aim
of building an integrated, data-based beauty platform. As part of the strategy, we have modernized and
upgraded our brand including a new logo and are in the process of developing our stores from being points of
sale to points of experience in order to enhance the customer experience. In addition, we have started to
implement the next phase of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst,
which focuses on digitalization in order to create a holistic journey for our customers. We are thus digitalizing
our entire supply chain management and using data analytics to deliver highly curated customer
communications. We believe that #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst will be a key driver for increased store traffic,
customer conversion rates and average volume per purchase going forward. See “Business—Strategy—Further
_implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst”._

In the financial year 2017/2018, we also implemented a pricing re-set in Germany, where we
recalibrated the pricing of our products to better fit the pricing sensitivities of our customers. While the
initiative contributed to a total decrease of our Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) margin in Germany from 10.4%

###### 102


-----

in the financial year 2017/2018 to 5.4% in the financial year 2019/2020, we believe that the re-set was
necessary in order to maintain our position and protect our margins in the competitive premium beauty
market. Our pricing algorithm sets prices dynamically according to competitor price developments and the
price sensitivity of each stock keeping unit (“SKU”). The price sensitivity score of each SKU is calculated
individually for each market based on approximately 10 to 15 external and internal input factors (e.g. traffic
share from price search engines). SKUs with high price sensitivity and high importance for price perception,
referred to as key value items (“KVIs”) are priced more aggressively and therefore closer to relevant
competitors in the market. For SKUs with the highest price sensitivity score, referred to as super-KVIs, we match
the price of the lowest relevant competitor in the market subject to certain conditions.

Furthermore, changes in our product mix have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our
brick & mortar sales and e-commerce sales and operating profit as profit margins for different categories and
products vary. In particular, our own brands and exclusive products allow for differentiation vis-à-vis key
competitors. The sales share of our own brands accounted for 6.6% of our total sales in the financial year
2019/2020. Own brands contribute to our profitability due to their competitive margins and relatively low
brand costs while being attractive to customers. On a product category basis, color cosmetics products were
slightly above average, while skin care and fragrances were slightly below average as compared to our Group’s
overall gross profit margin in the recent past.

_Cost Base_

Fixed costs represent a major share of our cost base and, consequently, are an important factor in
determining our financial results. Our fixed costs include rental expenses and energy costs. Personnel
expenses have both a fixed and semi-variable component due to the hiring of temporary workers during the
peak selling periods and variable compensation components. When offsetting our marketing and advertising
costs for other operating income from marketing and advertising costs recharged, personnel expenses, as well
as rental and energy costs were our largest cost factors in the periods under review.

Personnel expenses include the costs of staff in our directly operated brick & mortar stores, staff
operating our online shops and staff in our headquarters and other business operations performing mainly
administrative, centralized and service functions. The compensation of our sales employees and area managers
often includes a variable component based on the level of sales and other relevant KPIs, which leads to some
degree of fluctuation with respect to personnel costs. We also manage personnel expenses in our stores, to a
certain degree, by varying staffing levels in anticipation of customer traffic. The effect of recent COVID-19
related lockdowns in the countries where we operate on our personnel expenses varied on a country by
country basis. While the variable component of our sales employee compensation generally ceased to apply
during this period, we have also been able to take advantage of government initiatives in certain countries
aimed at alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have subsidized some of our personnel
expenses for periods where our stores were closed.

Our personnel expenses, which are in the vast majority fixed in the short term, increased from
€617.3 million in the financial year 2017/2018 to €642.7 million in the financial year 2018/2019 and decreased
to €581.0 million in the financial year 2019/2020. As a percentage of total sales, our personnel expenses
decreased from 18.8% in the financial year 2017/2018, to 18.6% in the financial year 2018/2019 and 18.0% in
the financial year 2019/2020. In the first quarter 2020/2021, our personnel expenses decreased to
€149.5 million from €172.9 million in the first quarter 2019/2020. Due to the fixed cost components of
personnel expenses, they typically represent a lower percentage of sales in our first financial quarter, which
includes the peak Christmas trading period. Our personnel expenses ratio decreased to 12.7% in the first
quarter 2020/2021 from 13.4% in the first quarter 2019/2020. These recent improvements of our personnel
expenses ratio mainly resulted from short term work due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may not be indicative
of our future personnel expenses.

Most of our lease agreements provide for fixed monthly lease payments, however some of the lease
agreements contain sales-related additional lease payments, meaning that a portion of the lease payment is
tied to the level of sales generated in the respective store, subject to a minimum lease payment. Moreover, in
certain jurisdictions, such as France, rent automatically increases pursuant to applicable law on the anniversary
date of a lease in accordance with an official index or otherwise tied to other indices (such as the Baupreisindex
in Germany). The lease agreements of our store portfolio across Europe include a variety of different lease
periods ranging from one to ten years, some of which contain extraordinary termination rights that allow for
earlier exits. Rent and utilities expenses increased from €355.2 million in the financial year 2017/2018 to
€358.2 million in the financial year 2018/2019 and subsequently decreased to €59.6 million in the financial year
2019/2020. The significant decrease in rent and utilities in the financial year 2019/2020 was due to the firsttime application of IFRS 16. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, our rent and utilities expenses was €338.2 million,
which is also partially reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the financial year 2019/2020. See
“—Factors Affecting Comparability—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16 (Leases)”, below.

###### 103


-----

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across Europe implemented two waves of
national lockdowns during the course of 2020. By the beginning of April 2020, nearly all of our stores were
closed. Although the majority of our stores slowly re-opened after the end of April 2020 depending on the
countries where they are located, some stores remained closed or closed again during subsequent lockdowns.
In part pursuant to certain government initiatives aimed at alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for
those countries which did not allow for reduction of lease payments by law in a pandemic, we have attempted
to defer and/or reduce lease payments on our leased premises for certain lockdown-affected periods.
However, our success at negotiating these arrangements has varied significantly on a case by case basis
depending on the landlord and country. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain any rent
deferrals or reductions in 2021.

_Marketing and Customer Retention_

We believe that driving customer loyalty and purchase frequency is critical to our growth and
profitability. We employ a holistic marketing strategy across all channels and customer touch-points. On a
gross basis, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in marketing which, in the
periods under review, constituted the third largest share in our cost base. However, the largest portion of our
annual gross marketing costs is financed by the third-party brand suppliers of selective products in the form of
so-called “market development funds.” These market development funds are funds that are made available by
brand manufacturers to help us in selling their products and create local awareness about the manufacturers’
brand and are typically used in the premium beauty market. In our statements of income, market development
funds are accounted for in other operating income as income services rendered to third parties.

As part of our updated #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we have adopted a data-centric
approach to our customer relationship management. Using customer behavioral data collected from online
purchases, use of our Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card and our marketing channels, our customer
relationship management analytics, driven by machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, allow us
to personalize all future customer interactions across all channels by clustering customers into segments and
providing them with tailored product recommendations, product news and other content. We believe that such
personalized curation drives customer loyalty and increases the frequency of customer interactions. Our
customer relationship management system assists us in getting to know our customers better, and to provide
them with personal recommendations, beauty content relevant to their preferences, and specific offers, which
in turn drives higher sales.

In the financial year 2019/2020 in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty), the number
of purchases per year per customer was 3.0 for Douglas Beauty Card holders and 5.4 for Douglas Beauty Card
holders who used the Douglas App. Over the same period in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty), average spend per customer was €52.1 for Douglas Beauty Card holders and €53.4 for Douglas
Beauty Card holders who used the Douglas App.

In addition, we have developed and with each additional customer transaction, are continuing to build
a Douglas data hub that collects data from our stores, our customer relationship management system, our
website, our Douglas App and retail and marketplace data. We intend to use this growing collection of data to
train our machine learning algorithms, which in turn will enable us to manage our internal processes more
efficiently, improve individualized customer offers and ultimately drive profitability.

_Seasonality, Working Capital and Inventory Management_

Our product portfolio covers nearly 130,000 SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including
additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace). We experience major seasonal
fluctuations in our total sales with a significant portion of our total sales typically being driven by key consumer
events. Our most important trading period is typically the seven- to eight-week period leading up to Christmas
(including Singles’ Day and Black Friday) and the New Year that ends on December 31 (which period falls into
the first quarter of our financial year).

Excluding the effects of extraordinary events like the COVID-19 pandemic, our first quarter typically
represents approximately one third of our annual sales (while the remaining sales are relatively equally split
between the last three quarters) and is therefore the most important quarter of our annual Adjusted EBITDA (as
reported). Our other important trading periods, varying from country to country, are those around St.
Valentine’s Day (in February), Easter (March or April, depending on the year), Mother’s Day (in May or June,
depending on the year or country) and Epiphany (in January).

Our gross profit margin (defined as total sales minus cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies
and merchandise) is affected by variation in pricing of products, supplier bonuses, different promotion
campaigns and assortment mix variations throughout the year. Our operating expenses are also affected by
seasonal trading patterns, such as the increase in the use of temporary workers during the busiest trading
periods.

###### 104


-----

In addition, our net working capital also shows significant seasonal patterns, with investment in
inventory generally reaching a peak in October and November while our trade payables, due to our general
payment terms with suppliers, typically peak in December. The development of our net working capital is a key
factor for our operating cash flow. We define net working capital as the sum of the sub-line items (i) inventories,
(ii) trade accounts receivable, (iii) trade accounts payable, and (iv) other receivable and liabilities related to
supplier receivables for rebates/bonuses and marketing subsidies as well as outstanding voucher liabilities.

Seasonal fluctuations also have a significant impact on our liquidity levels. Because of the payment
terms that we have agreed with our suppliers, trade payables typically peak in December and the cash inflow
from the peak Christmas trading season typically results in peak liquidity at the end of the calendar year.

Our net working capital increased from €231.3 million as of September 30, 2018, to €286.9 million as
of September 30, 2019 and decreased to €248.3 million as of September 30, 2020, mainly driven by a decrease
in inventory, an increase in trade accounts payable and voucher liabilities as a result of longer agreed payment
terms with suppliers and other deferred payables. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully
managed our inventory through both our e-commerce channel and store channel, as well as various categories
of our beauty products, and achieved a decrease in our inventory. Expressed as a percentage of total sales, our
net working capital ratio increased from 7.1% in the financial year 2017/2018, to 8.3% in the financial year
2018/2019 and decreased to 7.7% in the financial year 2019/2020. As of December 31, 2020, our net working
capital amounted to €187.9 million, or, expressed as a percentage of our total sales in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2020, to 6.0%.

_COVID-19 Pandemic_

We have been and expect to continue to be adversely affected by governmental efforts to contain the
COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant of these measures include imposition of quarantines, stay-at-home
orders, curfews, the closure of non-essential shops, restrictions on travel and the closure of national borders.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across Europe implemented two waves of
national lockdowns during the course of 2020. These measures led to the temporary closure of the majority of
our stores for periods throughout 2020 and as a result, negatively affected our business and results of
operations. For example, by the beginning of April 2020, nearly all of our stores were closed. We have been
and expect to continue to be adversely affected by governmental efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the majority of our stores slowly re-opened after the end of April 2020 dependent on the countries
where they are located, some stores remained closed or closed again during subsequent lockdowns or are
operating with reduced workforces and shortened opening hours. As a result, our store traffic and sales have
not reached pre-lockdown levels. For example, our store traffic (including Parfumdreams) decreased from
approximately 254 million in the financial year 2018/2019 to approximately 196 million in the financial year
2019/2020. Moreover, in our six core countries as of December 31, 2020, only 53.7% of our stores were open.
The drop in customer footfall in many locations led to significantly lower brick & mortar sales, and in the
periods following the lockdown, extended hygiene measures (such as requirements to wear masks and limits
on the number of customers in our stores) had to be implemented in stores for the health and safety of our
customers and employees, which also resulted in lower footfall. Despite the decrease in sales, fixed costs,
particularly in the form of personnel and rental expenses, have not fallen to the same extent. Overall, the
COVID-19 pandemic mainly contributed to a decline of our total brick & mortar sales by 15.8% in financial year
2019/2020 compared to the financial year 2018/2019 and 28.8% in the first quarter of 2020/2021 compared to
the first quarter of the prior year.

We have taken and continue to take a number of actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in
particular the expansion of our e-commerce capabilities and related customer support, focusing on tight cash
management, negotiating rent for our leased premises and taking advantage of rent deferrals where available,
actively managing personnel expenses, take advantage of state subsidies like short-term work or temporary
dismissal and working with suppliers to extend payments terms and manage returns. It is difficult to predict the
medium to long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the European premium beauty market and we
continue to closely monitor any decisions taken by the governments in the regions where we operate.

In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the shift towards online
retailing even outside of national lockdowns, which has in turn positively affected our e-commerce sales. Our
e-commerce sales increased by 40.6% in financial year 2019/2020 compared to the prior period and 74.3% in
the first quarter 2020/2021 compared to the prior year. Bolstered by the strength of our online beauty platform
and our strong brand awareness, we achieved segment share gains in the total premium beauty market across
our core countries, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the previous year
including increases in segment share of 1.6 percentage points in Germany that resulted in a total segment
share of 45.5%, 1.6 percentage points in France that resulted in a total segment share of 28.3%, 0.1 percentage
points in Spain that resulted in a total segment share of 11.8% and 0.5 percentage points in Italy that resulted in

###### 105


-----

a total segment share of 24.6% (excluding certain competitors such as Amazon e-commerce and Flaconi in
Germany).

Factors Affecting Comparability

_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16 (Leases)_

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaces the requirements of IAS 17 (Leases) and abolishes the classification of
leases into operating leases and finance leases for lessees, replacing it with a uniform accounting model where
leases are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. The right-of-use asset
is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the majority of rental expense previously
presented under IAS 17 as “other operating expense” is now recognized as depreciation of the right-of-use
asset. Furthermore, interest expense results from the ongoing accrual of interest on the lease liability.

We adopted IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective method. As a result, the
audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2017/2018 and the audited consolidated
financial statements for the financial year 2018/2019 have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 and
thus are not directly comparable with our audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year
2019/2020. Given the size of our portfolio of leased stores, we had a significant number of leases formerly
classified as operating leases under IAS 17. As a result, the adoption of IFRS 16 impacted our audited
consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020 by €1,230.9 million recognized as right of
use assets and €1,331.8 million recognized as lease liabilities. For more information, see notes 2, 13 and 25 of
our audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2019/2020.

_Acquisitions_

We have a track record of successfully executing acquisitions, including both large-scale acquisitions
as well as a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions. In November 2017, we completed the acquisition of
103 stores and the e-commerce platform of Perfumerias If, one of the leading perfumery and cosmetic chains
in Spain (including Andorra). In November 2017, we also acquired Limoni and La Gardenia, two leading Italian
beauty and perfumery chains which together comprised approximately 500 stores across Italy. In August 2018,
we acquired an 80.0% interest in Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH (“Parfumdreams”), which comprised an online
shop and brick & mortar stores in Germany. In July 2019, we acquired a 51.0% interest in Niche-Beauty.COM
GmbH (“Niche Beauty”), an emerging online portal for luxury niche and trend brands, strengthening our
assortment at the premium and niche cosmetics end. As a result, our results of operations for the financial year
2017/2018 only reflect 11 months of contribution from Perfumerias If, Limoni and La Gardenia and only one
month of contribution from Parfumdreams and thus are not fully comparable to our results of operations for the
financial year 2018/2019 and the financial year 2019/2020, and our results of operations for the financial year
2019/2020 only reflect three months of contribution from Niche Beauty and thus are not fully comparable to
our results of operations for the financial years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019.

Segments

The segment reporting of the Group, prepared in conformity with IFRS 8, reflects the internal
management and reporting structure, which is based on geographical regions. For the purposes of segment
reporting, the individual countries where we operate are allocated to the regions (reportable segments)
Germany, France, South-Western Europe and Eastern Europe. Service and regional holding entities are
allocated to the segments based on the region of their place of business. Transfers between our segments are
conducted on an arm’s length basis.

Explanation of Key Statements of Profit or Loss Items

The following section provides an explanation of the key items of our audited consolidated statements
of profit or loss.

_Sales_

Most of our brick & mortar sales and e-commerce sales are generated through the sales of goods (the
vast majority of which is retail with very limited wholesale), although part of our revenue is also generated
through the sales of services (including certain IT services and retail media sales) that we offer.

Like-for-like sales growth (in %) is defined as sales growth from like-for-like brick & mortar and from
e-Commerce, calculated for the period indicated and shown as a percentage change from the corresponding
previous period.

###### 106


-----

Like-for-like sales growth (brick & mortar) (in %) consists of sales growth from like-for-like stores. A
store is defined as like-for-like per each financial year when it has been open for at least one entire financial
year as of the first day of the relevant period (excluding any temporary closures for COVID-19 related reasons),
and is expected to be open for the full financial year. When comparing periods other than a financial year, e.g.
the first quarters of the financial years 2018/2019 and 2019/2020, a store is defined as like-for-like if the store
has been open in both first quarters and for at least one entire financial year (i.e. financial year 2018/2019,
excluding any temporary closures for COVID-19 related reasons) and is expected to be open for the full
financial year (i.e. financial year 2019/2020). One exception for the definition has been applied to the
calculation of like-for-like sales from financial year 2017/2018 to financial year 2018/2019: In November 2017,
we acquired Limoni S.p.A. (“Limoni”) and La Gardenia Beauty S.p.A. (“La Gardenia”). The acquired stores would
not qualify as like-for-like since they only contributed 11 months instead of a full fiscal year and were moreover
affected by numerous closings in financial year 2017/2018 and financial year 2018/2019. However, due to the
size of the acquisition compared to the gap between 11 months and full fiscal year, we included the Italian
acquisition in the like-for-like total for the financial year 2018/2019. As a result, like-for-like growth for financial
year 2018/2019 on a Group total level has been reduced from 2.6% to 1.9% (brick & mortar from 0.4% to 0.2%).
In the financial year 2017/2018, our brick & mortar sales included click & collect sales in France in the amount
of €15.6 million. These click & collect sales were classified as e-commerce sales in subsequent periods.

Like-for-like sales growth (e-commerce) (in %) reflects our organic e-commerce sales growth,
calculated for the period indicated, shown as a percentage change from the corresponding previous period. In
the financial year 2017/2018, our e-commerce sales did not include click & collect sales in France in the
amount of €15.6 million, which were instead classified as brick & mortar sales. Such click & collect sales were
classified as e-commerce sales in subsequent periods.

_Cost of Raw Materials, Consumables and Supplies and Merchandise_

Cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise consists of the cost of sourcing the
products that we sell, which include our selective product and exclusive product offerings, as well as our
own-branded products, from third-party suppliers. “On the invoice” discounts granted by suppliers on goods
purchased by us are accounted under cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise. We
also purchase raw materials and other supplies, such as shopping bags used in our stores, gift papers and
merchandising, the costs of which are also included in this line item.

_Other Operating Income_

Other operating income includes, in particular, refunds primarily for marketing costs, other recharged
costs to related parties and income from customer cards. Prior to the implementation of IFRS 16, other
operating income included income from leasing and subleasing largely resulting from stores leased that were
not used but were subleased.

_Personnel Expenses_

Our personnel expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries. In addition, our personnel expenses
cover social security charges, pension and other benefit costs (including expenses related to our defined
contribution plans) as well as redundancy costs. Our personnel expenses largely relate to the staff employed in
our stores. Additional personnel expenses include employees in the areas of our e-commerce business and all
other administrative functions (e.g. marketing, procurement, IT, and finance). Recent improvements of our
personnel expenses ratio mainly resulted from short term work due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may not be
indicative of our future personnel expenses or comparable to periods before the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Our other operating expenses mainly comprise marketing and advertising costs, goods handling costs
(which include packaging and shipment for online orders and merchandise transfer to stores), credit card fees,
and utility costs. In addition, the line item “other operating expenses” includes costs of transferring
merchandise (e.g., from warehouses to the stores), other services, and other costs, including IT, consulting and
repair costs. Prior to the implementation of IFRS 16, other operating expenses included rent and expenses
from subleases to third parties.

_EBITDA (=reported EBITDA)_

EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) (calculated as total sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and
supplies and merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses
and plus the result from impairments on financial assets) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore,

###### 107


-----

EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the
consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow
statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way,
EBITDA as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by
other companies. EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) as used in this section is unadjusted. Depreciation consists of
regular depreciation on equipment (in particular furniture, fixtures, IT equipment in stores, warehouse premises
and for our e-commerce platform and, after the implementation of IFRS 16, right of use assets), as well as on
intangible assets (mostly on IT licenses).

Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) is defined as EBITDA (= reported EBITDA) adjusted for those lease
expenses and income in accordance with IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance with IFRS 16, and
adjusted for those items which, in the opinion and decision of the management of the Parent, are non-regularly
recurring, exceptional or unsuitable for internal control, such as credit card fees, purchase price allocations,
restructuring costs and severance payments, consulting fees and other adjustments. We believe that Adjusted
EBITDA (as reported) is a useful performance measure. However, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) is not defined
as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) should be viewed as supplemental but not
as a substitute for data from the consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated statements of financial
position or consolidated cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies
define Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) in the same way, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) as shown in this offering
memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. See “Presentation
_of Financial Information”._

For more information, see “Presentation of Financial Information”.

_EBIT_

EBIT (calculated as EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) minus amortization/depreciation/impairment) is not
defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBIT should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for
data from the consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated statements of financial position or
consolidated cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBIT in
the same way, EBIT as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures
used by other companies. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, amortization/depreciation/impairment
includes the amortization of the right-of-use-assets, which are the amortization charges representing the
majority of rental expenses previously shown as other operating expense under IAS 17.

_Financial Result_

Our financial result represents our financial income and financial expenses, in accordance with IFRS 9.
The position “financial income” mainly includes income from loans and receivables, income from currency
exchange rate differences, and, following the implementation of IFRS 16, interest from compounding lease
receivables. The position “financial expense” primarily includes expenses for financial liabilities at amortized
costs and, following the implementation of IFRS 16, interest expense from compounding lease liabilities. In
addition, the position includes expenses from currency exchange rate differences, expense for financial assets
and liabilities at fair value, and the expense for non-controlling interest options.

_Profit or Loss of the Period (Net Income)_

Profit or loss of the period (net income) is calculated as EBT (earnings before taxes) less income taxes
for the respective period.

- As restated.

(1) EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) (calculated as total sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and
merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses and plus the result
from impairments on financial assets) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA (=reported EBITDA)
should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the consolidated statement of profit or loss,
consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS.
Since not all companies define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) as shown in this offering
memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA (=reported
EBITDA) as shown in the table above is unadjusted. See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

(2) EBIT (calculated as EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) minus amortization/depreciation/impairment) is not defined as a
measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBIT should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the
consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated statements of financial position or consolidated cash flow
statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies define EBIT in the same way, EBIT as shown in
this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBIT as shown

(*) As restated.

(1) Segment sales (net) represent, for each segment, total sales generated from transactions with third parties outside the
Group, while intersegment sales represent total sales generated from transactions with other segments of our Group.

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021, our total sales decreased by €120.0 million, or 9.3%, to €1,172.9 million
as compared to €1,292.9 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to partial or full lockdowns of our
brick & mortar stores for various periods in some of the countries in which we operate, offset by record growth
in e-commerce of 74.3%.

On a segment level, sales (net) of our German segment decreased by €27.9 million, or 5.8%, to
€453.0 million in the first quarter 2020/2021 from €480.9 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to
the second lockdown of our brick & mortar stores in 2020, which occurred in the second half of December
2020.

Sales (net) of our French segment decreased by €21.8 million, or 7.1%, to €287.3 million in the first
quarter 2020/2021 from €309.1 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to the lockdown of our
brick & mortar stores in November 2020, where stores could only be opened for click & collect.

Sales (net) of our South-Western Europe segment decreased by €57.1 million, or 15.5%, to
€312.3 million in the first quarter 2020/2021 from €369.4 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to
the partial or full lockdowns of our brick & mortar stores in some of the countries in which we operate.

Sales (net) of our Eastern Europe segment decreased by €13.3 million, or 10.0%, to €120.2 million in
the first quarter 2020/2021 from €133.5 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to the partial or full
lockdown of our brick & mortar stores in some of the countries in which we operate.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020, our total sales decreased by €220.8 million, or 6.4%, to
€3,232.7 million as compared to €3,453.5 million in the financial year 2018/2019, primarily due to a decrease in

###### 110


-----

brick & mortar sales by €447.3 million as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially
offset by our immediate countermeasures to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in e-commerce sales by
€237.4 million.

On a segment level, sales (net) of our German segment decreased by €18.7 million, or 1.5%, to
€1,270.4 million in the financial year 2019/2020 from €1,289.1 million in the financial year 2018/2019, which is a
proportionally smaller decrease than the overall Group average, primarily as our German segment has a higher
share of e-commerce sales as compared to the Group average. While we lost market share in Germany to
drugstores and pharmacies who could remain opened during national lockdowns, this was partially offset by
strong performance thereafter.

Sales (net) of our French segment decreased by €79.1 million, or 10.3%, to €688.0 million in the
financial year 2019/2020 from €767.1 million in the financial year 2018/2019, primarily due to the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, which led to store closures during the national lockdown from mid-March 2020 until
mid-May 2020.

Sales (net) of our South-Western Europe segment decreased by €121.7 million, or 11.6%, to
€929.8 million in the financial year 2019/2020 from €1,051.5 million in the financial year 2018/2019, primarily
due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to store closures during national lockdowns. Our
South-Western Europe segment was the segment most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to
the severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and Italy and the lengthy national lockdowns
subsequently implemented in both countries.

Sales (net) of our Eastern Europe segment decreased by €1.3 million, or 0.4%, to €344.5 million in the
financial year 2019/2020 from €345.8 million in the financial year 2018/2019, which is a proportionally smaller
decrease than the overall Group average, primarily as there were shorter national lockdowns and as a result,
less store closures in this segment.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019, our total sales increased by €176.7 million, or 5.4%, to €3,453.5 million
as compared to €3,276.8 million in the financial year 2017/2018, primarily due to an increase in e-commerce
sales by €160.8 million.

On a segment level, sales (net) of our German segment increased by €131.9 million, or 11.4%, to
€1,289.1 million in the financial year 2018/2019 from €1,157.2 million in the financial year 2017/2018. This
increase was attributable to our acquisition of Parfumdreams as well as the successful implementation of our
#FORWARDBEAUTY strategy.

Sales (net) of our French segment increased by €8.5 million, or 1.1%, to €767.1 million in the financial
year 2018/2019 from €758.6 million in the financial year 2017/2018. This increase was attributable to growth in
our online business, including an increase of €1.6 million in click & collect which started to be allocated to the
Group’s online business in France from the financial year 2018/2019 onwards.

Sales (net) of our South-Western Europe segment increased by €3.8 million, or 0.4%, to
€1,051.5 million in the financial year 2018/2019 from €1,047.7 million in the financial year 2017/2018. This
increase was attributable to growth in our online business.

Sales (net) of our Eastern Europe segment increased by €32.5 million, or 10.4%, to €345.8 million in
the financial year 2018/2019 from €313.3 million in the financial year 2017/2018. This increase was attributable
to growth across brick & mortar stores and our online business in all of our operations in Eastern Europe.

_Cost of Raw Materials, Consumables and Supplies and Merchandise_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021, our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise
decreased by €56.2 million, or 7.8%, to €659.9 million as compared to €716.1 million in the first quarter
2019/2020, primarily due to a decrease in net sales as a consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Expressed as a percentage of total sales, the ratio of our cost of raw materials, consumables and
supplies and merchandise increased from 55.4% in the first quarter 2019/2020 to 56.3% in first quarter
2020/2021, primarily due to the higher share of our e-commerce that traditionally has a higher cost of sales
ratio due to product mix and different levels of promotional activity.

###### 111


-----

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020, our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise
decreased by €85.3 million, or 4.5%, to €1,795.3 million as compared to €1,880.6 million in the financial year
2018/2019, primarily due to a decrease in sales.

Expressed as a percentage of total sales, the ratio of our cost of raw materials, consumables and
supplies and merchandise increased from 54.5% in the financial year 2018/2019 to 55.5% in financial year
2019/2020. This development was mainly due to the shift from our higher-gross margin brick & mortar
business to e-commerce as well as margin losses in our brick & mortar business mainly due to a shift in product
mix towards skin care.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019, our cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise
increased by €41.7 million, or 2.3%, to €1,880.6 million as compared to €1,838.9 million in the financial year
2017/2018. This increase was due to the increase in net sales and was also impacted by reassortment
adjustments and the associated impairment of inventories amounting to €21.8 million in the financial year
2018/2019 as a result of our new brand presence and an impairment of inventories of €87.0 million in the
financial year 2017/2018. Furthermore, the line item was affected by purchase price allocations amounting to
€3.8 million in the financial year 2018/2019 and €12.2 million in the financial year 2017/2018 respectively
related to the cost of goods and services.

Expressed as a percentage of total sales, the ratio of our cost of raw materials, consumables and
supplies and merchandise decreased from 56.1% in the financial year 2017/2018 to 54.5% in financial year
2018/2019, mainly driven by the above-mentioned inventory write off.

_Other Operating Income_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021, our other operating income decreased by €15.5 million, or 16.4%, to
€78.9 million as compared to €94.4 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to lower marketing
income driven by lower sales as a consequence of partial or full lockdowns due to COVID-19.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020, our other operating income decreased by €54.8 million, or 18.5%, to
€241.0 million as compared to €295.8 million in the financial year 2018/2019, primarily due to a decrease in
income from services rendered to third parties of €37.4 million in total (mainly driven by the impact of the sale
of our former headquarter in Hagen in 2018/2019 as well as by lower sales and traffic in stores as a
consequence of partial or full lockdowns due to COVID-19) as well as effects related to income from leasing
and sub-leasing, referring to the first time application of IFRS 16 in the amount of €10.1 million, offset by an
increase in other income of €10.5 million.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019, our other operating income increased by €11.3 million, or 4.0%, to
€295.8 million as compared to €284.5 million in the financial year 2017/2018, primarily due to income services
rendered to third parties (increased by €21.7 million) and income from the disposal of assets (increased by €8.9
million), partially offset by the decrease in income from the reversal of provisions of €13.6 million.

_Personnel Expenses_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021, our personnel expenses decreased by €23.4 million, or 13.5%, to
€149.5 million as compared to €172.9 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to the impacts from
lockdown due to COVID-19 (usage of short-time work, less full time employees on the floor in stores due to
lower traffic) and, to a lesser extent, less stores in our network.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020, our personnel expenses decreased by €61.7 million, or 9.6%, to
€581.0 million as compared to €642.7 million in the financial year 2018/2019, primarily due to the use of shortterm labor programs and the implementation of a hiring freeze. As a percentage of total sales, personnel
expenses accounted for 18.0% in the financial year 2019/2020 as compared to the financial year 2018/2019
with 18.6%.

###### 112


-----

Personnel expenses in the financial year 2019/2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic costs
including personnel-related vacancy costs, store optimization costs and restructuring and other costs

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019, our personnel expenses increased by €25.4 million, or 4.1%, to
€642.7 million as compared to €617.3 million in the financial year 2017/2018, primarily due to our acquisition of
Parfumdreams and the expansion of our business. As a percentage of total sales, personnel expenses
accounted for 18.6% and slightly improved as compared to the financial year 2017/2018 with 18.8%.

Personnel expenses in the financial year 2018/19 were again impacted by restructuring costs,
severance payments and other effects.

_Other Operating Expenses_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021, our other operating expenses increased by €15.0 million, or 7.1%, to
€225.5 million as compared to €210.5 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to higher goods
handling costs due to an increase in e-commerce.

Expressed as a percentage of total sales, our other operating expenses increased from 16.3% in the
first quarter 2019/2020 to 19.2% in the first quarter 2020/2021.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020, our other operating expenses decreased by €302.2 million, or 32.0%,
to €641.0 million as compared to €943.2 million in the financial year 2018/2019, primarily due to the first-time
application of IFRS 16, according to which the majority of rental expenses are no longer shown as other
operating expenses but reclassified as amortization of lease right-of-use assets in the amount of €288.1 million.
The decrease was partially netted by increased e-commerce-driven logistic costs and higher net marketing.

Expressed as a percentage of total sales, our other operating expenses decreased from 27.3% in the
financial year 2018/2019 to 19.8% in financial year 2019/2020, primarily due to the first-time application of IFRS
16. Absent the first-time application of IFRS 16, other operating expenses expressed as a percentage of sales
would have increased to 28.7% in financial year 2019/2020.

The effect of the first-time application of IFRS 16 of €288.1 million was partially offset by other
extraordinary effects during the period including fees for consulting services and financial effects related to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019, our other operating expenses increased by €39.7 million, or 4.4%, to
€943.2 million as compared to €903.5 million in the financial year 2017/2018, primarily due to our acquisition of
Parfumdreams and the expansion of our business.

Expressed as a percentage of total sales, the ratio of our other operating expenses decreased to
27.3% in the financial year 2018/2019 from 27.6% in financial year 2017/2018. Other operating expenses in the
financial year 2018/2019 included non-recurring items, such as consulting services, integration costs
associated with acquisitions and expenses associated with our new brand presence.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

_Overview_

Our business has required, and will continue to require, liquidity primarily to meet our debt service
requirements, to fund capital expenditures, to fund our operating activities, to pay our taxes and to fund our
working capital requirements.

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated from our operating activities
and cash on our balance sheet and if needed, drawings under our existing revolving credit facility. Following
the Transaction, we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity will be cash flow from operations and
drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to generate cash from our operating activities
depends on future operating performance, which in turn depends to a certain extent on general economic,
financial, competitive market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control,
as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” We believe that our cash flow from
operating activities, cash on hand the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (which will
be subject to certain conditions precedent) will be sufficient to fund our operating, capital expenditures and
debt service for at least the next twelve months. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior
_Secured Facilities Agreement.”_

However, given that the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, there exists a material uncertainty
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The COVID- 19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on our business, primarily due to
the temporary closure of the majority of our stores for periods throughout 2020. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Market Environment and Business – As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is_
_material uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our_
_Market Environment and Business – The outbreak of the coronavirus has had, and is likely to continue to have, a_
_material impact on our business and results of operations” and Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial_
statements for the financial year 2019/2020. Our ability to forecast our pace of recovery from the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the eventual levels to which our results of operations will return as well as our cash flows
are dependent on the re-opening of our stores, any future government-imposed restrictions or lockdowns in
the countries where we operate that result in further store closures as well as developments that could offset
the effects of store closures such as the continued shift towards online retailing as well as the optimization of
our store network through our SOP. If one or more of our assumptions in making our assessment to report as a
going concern are found to be incorrect, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.

The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by,
among other things, legal prohibitions on such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for
the purpose of servicing debt.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged in the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may
have important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors.” There are also limitations on our ability to
obtain additional debt or equity financing. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Indebtedness”. In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash_
flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby, and
increase our leverage.

(1) EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) (calculated as total sales less cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and
merchandise plus other operating income less personnel expenses less other operating expenses and plus the result
from impairments on financial assets) is not defined as a measure under IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA (=reported EBITDA)
should be viewed as supplemental but not as a substitute for data from the consolidated statements of profit or loss,
statements of financial position or cash flow statements determined in accordance with IFRS. Since not all companies
define EBITDA in the same way, EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) as shown in this offering memorandum may not be
comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA as shown in the table above is unadjusted.
See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

(2) Free cash flow is defined as the sum of the net cash flow from operating activities and the net cash flow from investing
activities.

(3) Net change in cash and cash equivalents is defined as the aggregate of net cash flow from operating activities, net cash
flow from investing activities and net cash flow from financing activities.

_Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021 our net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €60.9 million, or
14.7%, to €354.5 million as compared to €415.4 million in the first quarter 2019/2020. This decrease is
predominantly attributed to a decrease in EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) of €70.6 million and a higher decrease
in provisions of €12.7 million compared to €6.4 million in the first quarter of financial year 2019/2020 primarily
due to payment time-shifts. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in changes in other assets and
liabilities not classifiable to investing or financing activities of €14.5 million, mainly resulting from changed
payment terms regarding personnel liabilities (wages and income/church tax).

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/20 our net cash flow from operating activities increased by €295.3 million to
€493.6 million as compared to €198.3 million in the financial year 2018/2019. This increase was predominantly
attributed to an increase in EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) to €456.5 million in financial year 2019/2020 from
€282.5 million in financial year 2018/2019 due to the first-time application of IFRS 16 in the amount of
€278.0 million (representing lease expenses and income according to former IAS 17 which are to be capitalized
following IFRS 16), changes in net working capital without liabilities from investments in non-current assets
amounting to €41.9 million in the financial year 2019/2020 compared to €-39.7 million in the financial year
2018/2019 and an increase in changes in other assets and liabilities not classifiable to investing or financing
activities to €16.1 million in the financial year 2019/2020 compared to €-5.3 million in the financial year
2018/2019 primarily due to higher VAT and rent liabilities resulting from longer payment terms agreed with
lessors and moratoriums for taxes. This increase was partly offset by an increase in provisions of €5.8 million in
the financial year 2019/2020 compared to the previous year and an increase in provisions of €29.4 million in
the financial year 2018/2019 compared to the previous year.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/19 our net cash flow from operating activities increased by €69.3 million, or
53.7%, to €198.3 million as compared to €129.0 million in the financial year 2017/2018. This increase was
predominantly attributed to an increase in EBITDA (=reported EBITDA) by €80.8 million and an increase in
provisions of €29.4 million compared to a decrease in provisions of €22.9 million in the financial year
2017/2018, partly offset by changes in net working capital without liabilities from investments in non-current
assets of €-39.7 million compared to €-9.1 million in the financial year 2017/2018 and paid taxes of
€51.4 million in the financial year 2018/2019 compared to €31.3 million in the financial year 2017/2018.

_Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021 our net cash flow from investing activities increased by €3.8 million, or
12.2%, to an outflow of €27.3 million, as compared to an outflow of €31.1 million in the first quarter 2019/2020.
This decrease was primarily due to saving measures performed in light of the second wave of COVID-19.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020 our net cash flow from investing activities remained relatively stable at
an outflow of €105.5 million, as compared to an outflow of €106.4 million in the financial year 2018/2019. Cash
outflow in the financial year 2018/2019 was attributable to our acquisition of the 51.0% interest in Niche Beauty
amounting to €3.5 million and investments in non-current assets like store furniture and equipment amounting
to €128.0 million and was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our former headquarters in Hagen
amounting to €23.2 million. Cash outflow in the financial year 2019/2020 was primarily attributable to
investments in non-current assets like store furniture and software amounting to €107.8 million.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019 our net cash flow from investing activities decreased by €283.1 million,
or 72.7%, to an outflow of €106.4 million, as compared to an outflow of €389.5 million in the financial year
2017/2018. The cash outflow in financial year 2017/2018 primarily related to payments for the acquisition of
consolidated companies and other business units in the amount of €298.3 million relating to the acquisitions of
Limoni and La Gardenia, Perfumerias If and Parfumdreams as well as investments in non-current assets like
store furniture and equipment, which amounted to an outflow of €94.8 million in the financial year 2017/2018.

###### 120


-----

The higher cash outflows were primarily related to investments in non-current assets made shortly before the
balance sheet date of the financial year 2017/2018, in connection with the opening and acquisition of new
stores and investments in the design and re-design of existing stores, especially relating to the rollout of our
new visual brand language and logo.

_Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021, our net cash flow from financing activities decreased by €20.9 million, or
20.2%, to an outflow of €124.2 million as compared to an outflow of €103.3 million in the first quarter
2019/2020, mainly due to the payments for the repayment of financial liabilities, including the repayment of
amounts drawn under our existing revolving credit facility of €30.2 million, partly offset by repayments of
contingent consideration liabilities of €15.0 million in the financial year 2019/2020 related to the acquisition of
Limoni and La Gardenia.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020, our net cash flow from financing activities decreased by €98.6 million
to an outflow of €212.2 million as compared to an outflow of €113.6 million in the financial year 2018/2019,
primarily due to the first time application of IFRS 16, which resulted in the line item payments for the repayment
of financial liabilities amounting to €258.4 million, representing the reclassification of rental expenses, and
interest paid of €135.6 million, partially offset by our drawing of our existing revolving credit facility and
ancillary facilities in the amount of €165.5 million.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019 our net cash flow from financing activities decreased by €298.9 million
to an outflow of €113.6 million as compared to an inflow of €185.3 million in the financial year 2017/2018. The
cash inflow in the financial year 2017/2018 was mainly due to the drawing of an additional €300.0 million under
the Existing Senior Secured Facilities Agreement.

(*) As restated.

_Comparison of the First Quarters 2020/2021 and 2019/2020_

In the first quarter 2020/2021 our net working capital decreased by €40 million, or 17.5%, to
€187.9 million from €227.9 million in the first quarter 2019/2020, primarily due to strong limit control and
subsequent inventory decline as well as lower trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable as a result
of a reduction of sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2019/2020 and 2018/2019_

In the financial year 2019/2020 our net working capital decreased by €38.6 million, or 13.5%, to
€248.3 million from €286.9 million in the financial year 2018/2019. The decrease in net working capital was
mainly driven by a decrease in inventory, an increase in trade accounts payable and voucher liabilities as a
result of longer agreed payment terms with suppliers. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully
managed our inventory through both our e-commerce channel and store channel, as well as various categories
of our beauty products, and achieved a decrease in our inventory.

_Comparison of the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2018/2019 our net working capital increased by €55.6 million, or 24.0%, to
€286.9 million from €231.3 million in the financial year 2017/2018. The increase in net working capital was

###### 121


-----

mainly driven by a €78.5 million decrease in trade accounts payable, resulting from timing effects and additions
in non-current assets recognized near to the balance sheet date of financial year 2017/2018 but paid in the
financial year 2018/2019. This increase was partially offset by a €11.6 million decrease in inventories and a
€9.8 million decrease in other, related to less supplier bonus receivables and higher outstanding voucher
liabilities.

Investments and Capital Expenditures

The investments we made in the periods under review mainly relate to (i) acquisitions of businesses as
well as (ii) capital expenditures which we define as additions made to intangible assets (primarily relating to
acquired and internally generated software) and property, plant and equipment (mainly regarding the opening
of new stores, the refurbishment of existing stores, and the IT investment needed to maintain and grow our
business) (in each case irrespective of whether the respective payments were effected in the period indicated).

The main source of our historic, on-going and future investments has been, is and is expected to
continue to be, with respect to on-going capital expenditures, the positive cash flow from operating activities
and, with respect to acquisition of businesses, additional acquisition financing.

_On-Going and Future Investments_

In the first quarter of 2020/2021, we recorded accounting capital expenditures for investments in the
amount of €15.2 million of which €5.5 million related to stores and €4.8 million related to e-commerce. Of the
capital expenditures for investments, €8.6 million related to Germany, €1.6 million to France, €2.0 million to
South-Western Europe and €3.0 million to Eastern Europe.

Between December 31, 2020 and the date of this offering memorandum, we have continued to incur
capital expenditures mainly related to necessary investments in stores, e-commerce and IT-infrastructure.
Other than that, we have not made any significant investments.

On-going investments predominantly relate to IT-infrastructure for our e-commerce business as well
as refurbishment of our stores. Other than that, we have not decided on any significant future investments.

_Investments in the Financial Years 2019/2020, 2018/2019 and 2017/2018_

In the financial year 2019/2020 we recorded investments of €105.4 million, mainly related to store and
e-commerce IT and other IT infrastructure. Of such capital expenditures, €55.3 million related to Germany,
€15.8 million related to France, €20.9 million to South-Western Europe and €13.4 million to Eastern Europe.

In the financial year 2018/2019 we recorded investments of €108.6 million, mainly related to store and
e-commerce IT and other IT infrastructure. Of such capital expenditures, €50.8 million related to Germany,
€18.5 million related to France, €23.3 million to South-Western Europe and €16.1 million to Eastern Europe.

In the financial year 2017/2018 we recorded investments of €126.4 million, mainly related to store
refurbishments and openings. Of such capital expenditures, €55.9 million related to Germany, €23.1 million
related to France, €31.9 million to South-Western Europe and €15.6 million to Eastern Europe.

Our capital expenditures in the financial years 2019/2020, 2018/2019 and 2017/2018 primarily related
to store and e-commerce IT and other IT infrastructure as well as investments in the refurbishment,
maintenance, design and re-design of existing stores, whereas the level of these refurbishment and
maintenance related capital expenditures was relatively stable over the last three financial years.

We currently expect in the short to medium term our capital expenditures expressed as a percentage
of total sales to slightly decrease as a percentage of net sales although actual capital expenditure could be
higher.

Provisions for Pensions

Pension provisions are recognized for funded and non-funded employer-financed commitments
arising from pension entitlements and ongoing payments to employees and former employees and their
surviving dependents. They are also recognized for purely employee-funded commitments from deferred
compensation. The pension entitlements usually relate to a payment for contractually agreed retirement
pensions as a monthly amount. These commitments are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of
IAS 19—“Employee Benefits”. Accordingly, actuarial gains/losses are recognized directly and in full via a
separate equity component.

year 2019/2020.

_Off-Balance Sheet Commitments_

As of September 30, 2020, we had commitments with respect to purchase commitments for approved
capital expenditure in property, plant and equipment or intangible assets amounting to €23.8 million,
assuming capital expenditure as expected in the first quarter of the financial year 2020/2021.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risks

_Overview_

We are exposed to liquidity risks, default/credit risks as well as market risks, such as foreign currency
and interest rate risks. The following description presents information about our exposure to each of the
foregoing risks and our objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks, as based on the
respective notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2019/2020.

_Liquidity Risk_

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they fall due, e.g.,
settlement of our financial debt and paying our suppliers. Our approach is to ensure, as far as possible, that we
will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when due, under normal but also under stressed
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. We generally have
access to various sources to finance operations, investments and potential acquisitions. This includes existing
cash and cash equivalents, net cash flow from operating activities and bank debt.

Most of our German subsidiaries and the majority of foreign subsidiaries are linked to a cash
management system (cash pooling). By combining financing volumes, short-term liquidity surpluses of
individual Group companies can be used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies. This
leads to a reduction in borrowing and an optimization of cash investments, thus having a positive impact on our
net interest result.

During the periods under review, we had to meet certain obligations and key financial covenants in
our financing agreements. Besides these financial covenants, the Group also has to meet certain qualitative
covenants. If the obligations were not met, the lenders were entitled to cancel the loan agreements with
immediate effect and call upon all pledged collateral. All contractual obligations were met in the financial years
2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2019/20.

Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial
position. For further information, see the “Liquidity Risk” section in our Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements presented in this offering memorandum. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financing—We
_are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital_
_needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.”_

_Interest Rate Risk_

Interest rate risk is the result of fluctuations in interest rates on the money and capital markets and
market-related fluctuations of exchange rates.

###### 124


-----

During the periods under review, the amounts that we borrowed under the Existing Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement were subject to variable interest rates. To reduce the risk of cash flow fluctuations due to
changes in interest rates of variable loans, we entered into interest rate hedging agreements.

After giving effect to the Transaction, we anticipate that amounts we borrow under the Senior Secured
Facilities will be subject to variable interest rates. As a result, we may enter into interest rate hedging
agreements in respect of a portion of the new Senior Secured Facilities.

For further information see the “Interest Rate Risk” section in our Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements presented in this offering memorandum. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating Related to our
_Financing—The loans under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreement bear interest at floating rates that could rise_
_significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.”._

_Foreign Currency Risk_

The operative companies of our Group largely conduct their activities in the respective functional
currency. Currency risks within the Group are estimated to be low since our sales in countries where the Euro is
the legal tender represented 90.2% of our total sales in the financial year 2019/2020, and merchandise was
purchased almost exclusively in Euros. In order to monitor the residual currency risks, our financial
management regularly reviews our currency items and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of
implementing derivative financial instruments. We did not enter into currency hedging contracts in the periods
under review.

Within the scope of IFRS 7, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for foreign currency risks. The
sensitivity analysis shows the effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in financial instruments
denominated in foreign currency and not designated as hedged items. In total, we would be exposed to a net
risk of €-0.3 million in the financial year 2019/2020 (2018/2019: €-0.1 million, 2017/2018: €-0.1 million)
following an appreciation in value of the Euro of 5% and €+0.3 million in the financial year 2019/2020
(2018/2019: €+0.1 million, 2017/2018: €+0.1 million) as a consequence of a devaluation of 5%.

For further information see the “Foreign Currency Rate Risk” section in our Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements presented in this offering memorandum.

_Default/Credit Risk_

Default risk is the risk of financial losses if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The default risk generally arises from all financial assets in the portfolio, such
as trade accounts receivable, other receivables, cash investments with bank partners and derivatives with a
positive market value. The carrying amounts of the financial assets and contract assets correspond to the
maximum default risk.

A default risk could exist if a banking partner defaults on payments and bank deposits, in particular as
a result of insolvency in the context of financial investments or positive market values from derivatives. We
mitigate this risk by exclusively investing in monetary deposits and entering into financial instruments with firstrate banks. At the same time, the volume is distributed among several contracting parties in order to avoid a
concentration of risks. Due to the difficult global economic situation, larger monetary deposits are avoided or
only made with first-class German banks.

Due to the increased focus on internet sales, the companies of our Group are exposed to credit risk,
which is a system-inherent risk in the mail order business. For this reason, the companies of our Group operate
an effective and constantly optimized debtor management system including consistent dunning procedures.

Selected Critical Accounting Policies regarding the Preparation of Our Consolidated Financial Statements

The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company’s management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income or sales, expenses,
assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of each reporting period. For a
discussion of our critical accounting policies for the application of which the Company’s management was and
is required to exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions, see note 4 of our Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2019/2020.

###### MARKET AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

_Unless otherwise stated, the statements on market and competition provided below are based on our_
_internal market observations and estimates—some of which are, in turn, derived from various sources we believe_
_to be reliable, including industry publications and surveys or studies conducted by third parties—and/or studies_
_commissioned by us, in particular a study prepared by OC&C entitled “European Beauty Market Review_
_December 2019”, as last updated on March 8, 2021 (the “OC&C Report”). While we did not verify or modify any_
_of the market or other data provided by OC&C, we have delivered, upon OC&C’s request, certain factual_
_information to OC&C and have discussed the underlying assumptions with OC&C. We compiled our estimates_
_for the market and competitive data in part on the basis of available historical data and in part on the basis of_
_assumptions and methodologies which we believe to be reasonable, as well as various sources we believe to be_
_reliable._

_Because publicly available information on the premium beauty markets in the different countries is only_
_available to a very limited extent, the data included in the OC&C Report and shown in this offering_
_memorandum is based on a modeling methodology, as further described below. In addition, OC&C made_
_assessments regarding the premium beauty sales of competitors using different approaches and_
_methodologies, especially where published results for the different competitors (e.g., with respect to the_
_respective sales of selective beauty products) were not available; in certain cases, sales for us and our_
_competitors were considered for different periods, thus limiting comparability._

_In the OC&C Report, the premium beauty market was derived from the total market for beauty and_
_personal care per market region using a modeling methodology defining, firstly, the premium “channels”, which_
_are market players with a substantial share of sales of premium beauty products, within the respective regional_
_total beauty and personal care markets (for example, depending on the country, beauty specialist retailers,_
_department stores and online players). The OC&C Report defines the key product categories sold, though not_
_exclusively, through the selective distribution channel, i.e., the beauty product categories fragrances, skin &_
_body care, and color cosmetics, as opposed to hygiene product categories (which are not included in this_
_definition of the premium beauty market). An estimation was made regarding the percentage of sales pertaining_
_to premium beauty products within each of the defined channels (i.e., the share of premium products sold by_
_department stores, e-commerce players, drugstores, etc.) in order to arrive at an approximation of the resulting_
_“premium segment” value for each country, which also includes e-commerce sales of premium beauty products._
_Market size is based on net sales. For online channel, OC&C’s analysis includes, besides traditional online_
_orders, sales via mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, as well as products that are ordered online_
_and picked-up in stores. The premium beauty market, as assessed by OC&C, includes beauty products_
_pertaining to selective products (including exclusive products) and (except when assessing the premium beauty_
_market) also the beauty categories—fragrances, skin & body care and color cosmetics—pertaining to private label_
_products, although private label products, strictly speaking, do not represent selective products as they are not_
_supplied by premium brand suppliers through the selective distribution channel, but rather directly sourced by_
_the respective retailer from third-party manufacturers._

_Therefore, the following data, especially on market sizes, past and projected growth rates and_
_competitive position should be viewed with caution and in light of such limitations, and may differ from market_
_and competitive data contained in other analyses or calculations of selective sales of competitors. Additional_
_factors, which should be considered in assessing the market and competitive data, including the projected_
_growth rates, are described elsewhere in this offering memorandum, in particular those set out in the section_
_entitled “Risk Factors”._

_OC&C’s sales assessments are, unless otherwise stated, based on net sales at current prices (i.e., not_
_adjusted for inflation), including VAT and using a fixed exchange rate for Polish zloty of 4.35 PLN per euro._

Overview

As the leading European premium beauty platform across our core markets (Germany, France, Spain,
Italy, the Netherlands and Poland), our online and offline assortment comprises fragrances, skin care (including
body care), color cosmetics, hair cosmetics and beauty nutrition, complemented by other offerings such as hair
accessories, bath and shower products, deodorants and gift sets. These categories also include professional
beauty products, such as electrical skin cleaning brushes, home accessories, such as home textiles, dishware or
decorative articles, and personal accessories, such as scarves and fashion or costume jewelry. From a product
type perspective, we focus mainly on premium beauty products from third-party, mostly premium, brands
(selective products), some of which are distributed exclusively by us on a European basis or in a specific region
and for an agreed period of time (exclusive products), and on our own-brand products, with which we target
different segments within the European beauty and personal care market. The European beauty market is
increasingly shifting to the premium segment, with high margin luxury, niche and prestige products accounting
for 36% of the market in 2019. We focus mainly on the premium beauty market, an attractive sub-segment of

###### 126


-----

the broader beauty and personal care market where manufacturers of premium brands limit the distribution of
their products to selected qualified retailers, as opposed to the mass distribution channel. Suppliers thus favor
trusted retailers with strong brand awareness who can offer appropriate brand presentation and store
appearance, high levels of customer service from specially trained employees, breadth of product assortment
and broad customer and geographical reach. We believe that this is an attractive and to a certain extent,
resilient market segment benefitting from positive market dynamics, and thus provides a solid foundation for
our future growth.

Therefore, the following market description is based on the premium beauty market, which is a market
segment within the broader European beauty and personal care market (the “beauty market”). The premium
beauty market within our core markets of operation (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland
(collectively, the “core markets”)) and core categories (fragrances, skin & body care, make-up) was worth
approximately €13.8 billion in 2019, which accounted for approximately 36% of the total beauty and personal
care market for the core markets in that year.

From a regional perspective, our most important markets are Germany and France, in which we
generated approximately 39% and 21% of our sales, respectively, in the financial year 2019/2020. These two
markets are also the two largest within the European premium beauty market and together accounted for more
than half of the total European premium beauty market in 2019, according to the OC&C Report. Our other core
markets of operation are Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland. Sales generated from the core markets
contributed to 90.7% of our sales in the financial year 2019/2020.

The European Premium Beauty Market

The premium beauty market in Europe is a particularly attractive and to some extent, resilient segment
within the larger European beauty and personal care market. Historically, the European beauty market in our
core markets grew at a stable CAGR of 2.3% from 2015 to 2019. Apart from France, the premium beauty
markets in our core markets have consistently grown and have gained an increasing share of the overall beauty
market in each of the core markets from 2014 to 2019, according to the OC&C Report. In the selective
distribution channel of the European beauty and personal care market (as opposed to the mass market), brand
manufacturers approve retailers to sell their products if they fulfill certain specific qualitative criteria, aimed at
ensuring an appropriate premium sales environment for their brands; for example:

    - an adequate product and brand presentation in store (online players are required to have a
physical store presence in order to be able to source their products through the selective
distribution channel);

    - appropriate service levels through qualified and trained employees;

    - breadth of product assortment and product availability;

    - specialist advice and testing opportunities; and

    - appropriate appearance and composition of stores.

Through such requirements, brand manufacturers select the retailers who they approve for the sale of
their products. Selective distribution is a key means through which suppliers protect the upscale reputation of
their products and brands and exert control over the distribution of their branded products by using only
distribution channels that fit their desired brand image. In general, the level of brand usage rights depends on
the level of fulfillment of the different requirements. Suppliers, however, do not impose minimum price
obligations on retailers.

Fragrances, body and skin care and color cosmetics (make-up) are typical product categories sold via
the selective distribution channel. By contrast, in the mass market, which in addition to the aforementioned
categories also includes hygiene products such as oral hygiene or bath and shower products and mass beauty
products, there is no such selection of retailers and no such selection of certain distribution channels.

###### 127


-----

According to the OC&C Report, the European beauty market was worth €92.1 billion in 2019, out of
which our key product categories, fragrances, skin care (including body care) and color cosmetics, accounted
for 82%, and out of which the premium segment in our core markets accounted for €13.8 billion, or 36% of the
beauty market across the core markets and in our key product categories. The following chart illustrates the
size of the European beauty market within the broader European beauty and personal care market as used
throughout this section:

_Source: OC&C Report._

Germany and France were the two largest markets within the European premium beauty market in
2019, amounting to €4.0 billion and €4.7 billion, respectively. In both countries, the premium beauty segment
constituted 32% and 51%, respectively, of the overall market. Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland, our
other core markets, had market sizes of €2.2 billion, €1.9 billion, €0.6 billion and €0.4 billion, respectively.
Except for France, the overall premium beauty markets in our core markets have experienced consistent
growth, ranging from CAGRs of 1.6% (The Netherlands) to 7.1% (Poland) from 2014 to 2019, and are expected
to further grow between 2022 and 2024, according to the OC&C Report.

_Substantial Success Factors and Advantages for Larger Players_

Within the European premium beauty market, large beauty players are typically in a better position to
fulfill the criteria required by selective fragrance, skin & body care and cosmetics suppliers to protect their
brands and luxury image through customer touchpoints via a store network, established brands (since
suppliers generally prefer retailers with strong brand awareness), high service levels and well-trained staff,
customer reach, breadth of assortment, omnichannel presence and market penetration. In addition, larger
beauty retailers also benefit from certain economies of scale, such as advantages in purchasing conditions, as
well as the ability to support promotions and other marketing activities on a larger scale. Large and influential
manufacturers also often rely on large players to bring product innovations to the market. Large beauty players
with cross-country presence can also significantly benefit from their established and long-term contractual
relationships with premium fragrance, skin & body care and color cosmetics suppliers.

A strong omnichannel presence allowed us to provide all purchasing options (online only,
online-to-offline, offline-to-online, offline only) pre-COVID-19. This ultimately enabled a much quicker shift in
focus to the online portion of our business while stores were/ are closed as a result of government restrictions
or lockdowns in response to COVID-19.

Because only a limited number of retailers can meet the high demands of suppliers of selective beauty
products, new (especially small) players face challenges when trying to enter the stationary or the online
market.

Large players also offer a more experiential shopping experience through their strong omnichannel
services along various customer touch points, e-commerce operations and investments in e-commerce
capabilities, which enhances customer engagement and spending. In addition, larger, well-known offline or
online players profit from their high brand recognition vis-à-vis customers, since consumers often seek a
trusted and established partner, especially in times of almost infinite product variety, when familiarity and
guidance regarding their choice of product is particularly important to them.

Development and Prospects

_General_

Our key product categories, fragrances, skin care (including body care) and color cosmetics,
accounted for approximately 82% of the total European beauty market of €92.1 billion in 2019. The premium
beauty market in the core markets amounted to approximately €38.6 billion (in terms of sales) in 2019.

Overall, the premium beauty market in Europe has demonstrated a strong resilience, compared to
other consumer-related industries. For example, the European beauty market showed lower cyclicality than the
apparel or homewares industry from 2005 to 2019, including during the recession of 2008-2010 and the
COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to present. In particular, Germany, the largest market among the core markets,
exhibited especially low cyclicality, with the beauty market outgrowing both GDP and consumer spending,
during the recession of 2008-2010.

The beauty market has also benefited from robust margins, and in particular, those of premium
brands. Leading premium brands’ investment in marketing generated attractive margin, which benefitted
premium-focused multi-brand retailers that partner with such leading brands. As most of such marketing
expenditures are covered by global brands, the premium-focused multi-brand retailers, who are the selective
distribution partners of such brands and also have access to premium brands and scale, are able to monetize a
higher share of the profit achieved by such brands as a result of such marketing. The average gross margins for
leading beauty retailers are higher compared to other retail sub-sectors, such as sports, DIY/tools or watches/
jewelry.

The online channel is expected to significantly outgrow the offline beauty market and double its share
of the total beauty market by 2024. Despite its expected decline in growth, the offline channel will remain a
major retail channel. Up to 50% of consumers switched to the online channel during the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The trend is expected to, at least partially, continue post COVID-19. See “—Impact of the
_COVID-19 pandemic” below for more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the beauty_
market. Although COVID-19 amplified the trend, there is expected to be a lasting reduction in city traffic
impacting many stores. However, consumers are equally keen to return to shops in search of inspiration and
experiential shopping. Moreover, increases in conversion rates indicate shoppers may be becoming more
intentional with their store visits. As a result, a strong omnichannel presence is key to serving all customers’
needs.

_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused several lockdowns and resulted in store closures,
offline sales in the beauty market (including both premium and mass segments, sold via selective channels and
pure-play online retailers) have significantly declined across the core markets (with decreases ranging from
approximately 24% to 31%), whereas online sales have soared (with increases ranging from approximately 40%
to 85%) in 2020. However, across all core markets, online growth only partially compensated for declines in
offline sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in an overall market decline of approximately
18-20%. According to the OC&C Report, we outperformed the beauty market in most of our core markets, and
in particular, in the online channel, where we significantly outperformed across all six core markets and against
leading online beauty pureplay retailers. Our outperformance in Germany in particular was driven by our
stronger market share and growth in online revenue.

According to the OC&C Report, based on GDP recovery (and aligned beauty market recovery)
scenarios, it is expected that there will be a large bounce back of sales in 2021, with such normalization phase
to develop in line with historic market development before the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the OC&C
Report, the premium beauty and wider beauty market is expected to slightly outperform GDP recovery, at
varying rates across different markets. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our
business, see “Summary—Recent Developments”.

_Growth in Premium Beauty Segment_

The European premium beauty market has benefitted from growth in all brand segments (luxury/
niche, prestige, masstige and mass) from 2014 to 2019, as further presented in the following chart:

_Source: OC&C Report._

The premium beauty segment, including the luxury/niche segment and prestige segment, grew at a
CAGR of 2.6% over the 2014-2019 period. The luxury/niche segment grew at a CAGR of 2.8% over the 20142019 period, driven by the volume growth and, to a lesser extent, price/mix changes during the period. The
prestige segment grew at a CAGR of 2.5% over the 2014-2019 period.

The growth during the period was due to various drivers. Fragrances and skincare drove growth in the
value of selective beauty products, despite a decline in make-up products. Innovations in the luxury segment,
driven by brands expanding their luxury and niche/exclusive lines during the period, also contributed to the
growth in the premium segment. Moreover, high tech products and clinical ingredients, along with wellness
products, were continuously featured in beauty retail channels. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic
ingredients and natural products, driving growth in sophisticated and premium products. Lastly, increased
focus on sustainable packaging resulted in an increase in the overall packaging and related costs for more
brands.

The premium beauty markets in the core markets have varying levels of premium segment penetration
and growth. France has the largest premium segment but has experienced some value pressure, due to strong
promotional activities, increased cross-border beauty sales and niche brands gaining incremental share from
traditional premium brands. The premium beauty segment (along with mass segment) experienced a steady
growth across the core markets (except for France), as further set forth below, in the period 2014-2019:

The online channel accounted for, on average, 14% of the premium beauty market across the core
markets (to a varying degree) in 2019. According to the OC&C Report, online penetration of the total beauty
and personal care market in our core markets in 2019 amounted to 5% (Italy), 9% (France), 11% (Spain), 22%

(Germany and the Netherlands) and 28% (Poland). Over the recent years, the online channel of the premium
beauty market in the core markets has shown strong growth with a CAGR of 21% in the 2014-2019 period.
However, the online penetration in the premium beauty market is still modest compared to the level of
penetration in other retail sectors, despite the fact that it has an increasingly fact pace of expansion. As a result,
pure-play online players still have limited presence in the premium beauty market compared to large
omnichannel retailers, such as us or Sephora, according to the OC&C Report.

Key Consumer Trends

The European premium beauty market benefits from a number of major, long-term general consumer
trends that have driven the overall positive development and future growth of the market. According to the
OC&C Report, these long-term trends, which also apply to our core markets, with local variations, include:

_Premium beauty customers with complex needs and high expectation of the shopping_
_experience:_ Premium beauty customers are demanding, with complex needs and high expectations towards
the overall shopping experience. The customers typically engage in five different types of purchase missions.

###### 131

-----

While approximately 56% of these purchase missions are classified as direct or inspirational replacement, the
remaining share is split over the missions “treat myself”, “try something new”, “solve a problem” and “gifting”.
This means that although 56% of premium beauty purchase missions are classed by consumers as
‘replacement’ missions, almost half of these missions involve switching product and/or brands, and seeking
inspiration or guidance. In total, this means that over 70% of expenditure in the premium beauty market
requires advice and helps to explain why specialist formats and multi-brand operators hold material market
shares. Customers are also highly engaged across every step of the customer journey, with a significant share
of cross-channel behavior.

_Shopping as an omnichannel experience:_ Shopping is increasingly regarded not only as a strictly
functional activity, but also as a leisure activity in itself, regardless of whether the customer purchases online or
offline, as boundaries in an increasingly connected, omnichannel world become less defined (for example, the
integration of online and offline channels allows customers to browse online, buy in-store, ship-from-store or
“click & collect”). On the one hand, customers increasingly purchase online, which may save them time, money
and effort (for example, for customers who want to make pre-selected or replenishment purchases efficiently).
Online shopping also allows customers to browse through a broad selection of products quickly. In this
respect, a trend towards an increasing use of mobile applications (which enable easy access, anywhere and
anytime) can also be observed. On the other hand, customers may also remain, with respect to beauty
products, offline customers, because they wish to see, touch, feel, smell and test many beauty products in
person, and appreciate the physical store experience in attractive surroundings. In addition, friendly, personal
and competent customer advice are aspects of a shopping experience, which cannot currently be provided to
the same extent online. This underscores the increasing importance for beauty retailers of store location
(particularly, of prime locations in urban centers) and appearance as well as qualified staff able to provide
expert advice and an excellent online offering.

_Beauty and personal care products gaining importance/Evolving customer groups:_ Certain target
customer groups have become increasingly important to beauty retailers: (i) the generation 50+, which is not
only growing in size due to the demographic change, places an increasing emphasis on its appearance, has the
financial means to afford premium to luxury products; and shows, for example, a growing interest in anti-aging
lifestyle products in order to maintain a young look and lifestyle; (ii) young and middle-aged customers, who
wish to take preventive anti-aging measures; (iii) female adolescents as a newer target group for color
cosmetics, who start to use make-up at an even earlier age; and (iv) male customers who increasingly care
about their physical appearance, discovering beauty products as part of their lifestyle.

_Beauty products increasingly regarded as “personal rewards”:_ In spite of, or even because of
unstable economic perspectives, the demand for so-called small luxuries has grown: small, affordable “feelgood” products are being used on a more regular basis to compensate for uncertainty and a less stable
income and as personal rewards (e.g., when other, more substantial expenses have to be given up). In our
view, selected fast-moving product categories such as fragrances are shifting to a more premium offering and
serve as first entrance into the luxury products market.

_Customers becoming more discerning and requiring products that are more individual:_ Increasingly
well-informed customers are demanding specific products that cater to their needs. This includes, in particular:
(i) healthy products, natural, organic, sustainable or vegan products, (ii) innovative products, reflecting
state-of-the-art scientific research, (iii) private label products, which are often an attractive option for customers
at price-entry levels, and (iv) customized or individualized products and targeted services offers to address the
increasing desire by customers to express personality and turn away from the mass, which is driving demand
for a greater product variety. Even formerly standardized, everyday products are becoming more
individualistic, catering to specific consumer needs and desires.

Competitive Environment

According to the OC&C Report, we are a leading European beauty platform across all of our six core
markets. Based on sales in 2019, we hold a market leading position of 26% in Germany (ahead of Müller with
12%), 14% in Italy (ahead of Sephora with 7%), 40% in the Netherlands (ahead of ICI Paris XL with 33%) and
41% in Poland (ahead of Sephora with 32%). We also hold the second largest market share in France (16%) and
the third in Spain (11%).

(1) Based on the OC&C Report.

(2) Selective online players have introduced a limited private label range but with insignificant overall market / revenue
share.

(3) Available for some pureplay players but without a strong beauty focus.

(4) Available for selective players only.

(5) Available for certain parts of players only, accelerated due to COVID-19 and includes “call & collect”

The following chart illustrates the landscape of the beauty retailers in Europe, presenting the scope of
presence (local, national and pan-European) and the product segments (luxury, prestige and masstige) they
provide in the respective markets:

Within the European premium beauty market, our most relevant competitors include (i) other beauty
retailers/perfumeries with a presence in several European countries, such as Sephora, Marionnaud, Druni and

###### 133


-----

ICI Paris XL (there are relatively few selective beauty retailers with a substantial size), (ii) the selective beauty
departments of selected department stores (such as Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof and El Corte Inglés), including
those of luxury department stores (such as Galeries Lafayette), (iii) pharmacies and para-pharmacies (which
increasingly focus on skin care and natural cosmetics), as well as (iv) some drugstores or hypermarkets with a
separate section for selective products (such as Müller, Rossmann or Kruidvat). Most drugstores, as well as food
retailers and other similar competitors offer predominantly mass market products in most countries, and thus
typically do not directly compete with us in the premium beauty market.

In addition, we compete with duty free shops and monolabels, such as Yves Rocher or Kiko Milano,
representing significantly smaller businesses with a more limited product range of own brands and with their
own distribution channel; however, we compete for customers with such monolabels, even if they are not part
of the selective distribution channel.

We also compete with so-called pure-play online or primarily online-based competitors. Online
players include (i) online perfumeries (such as Flaconi and FeelUnique), which mostly focus on both selective
and non-selective brands, and (ii) retail platforms (such as Amazon, Zalando or eBay). Online perfumeries that
fulfill the suppliers’ requirements, such as a physical store presence, opportunities for customers to test
products or the provision of comprehensive customer advice in the stores (even with a rather limited stationary
presence) may source their products through the selective distribution channel. Other online competitors, such
as generalist retail platforms and marketplaces (which offer other products besides beauty and personal care
products), mostly operate in the mass market segment.

A limited “grey market” exists in some of the typically non-selective retail formats, such as drugstores,
food retailers or online marketplaces, in which certain selective beauty products are sold through channels
other than the official channels explicitly allowed by the manufacturers, sometimes even at discount prices. For
example, online players, who are not duly authorized by the respective suppliers to distribute their selective
products, may obtain selective products from authorized retailers that want to dispose of excess or older stock.
In addition, selective products that are sold more cheaply in not yet established regional markets or emerging
markets may be introduced in established markets at lower prices through the re-import of products from
other countries or otherwise. These products are typically offered at discounted prices that can be substantially
lower than those of the selective distributors and could increasingly undermine the selective distribution
channel business model. These products can appear first in online/mobile searches for a particular product, for
example through online price comparison tools. However, the grey market remains limited because suppliers
of selective products and selective retailers such as us regularly adopt measures aiming at counteracting grey
market activities as soon as they become aware of them (e.g., by implementing tools and devices that allow for
tracking of their stock, such as hidden codes). Grey market issues are also relevant, depending on the country,
with respect to our brick & mortar store business where we have noticed increased competition from grey
market products, especially in certain cases in which drugstores and discounters want to expand their selective
offerings and source selective products from the grey market. Furthermore, these types of offerings sometimes
also extend to counterfeit products. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and
_Business—We face competition in the markets in which we operate and such competition may intensify further.”_

While the competitive landscape varies by country, the larger players that are present across several
European countries (such as us, Sephora and Marionnaud) are generally also the most important players in the
respective premium beauty markets, with the top-two or top-three players typically commanding a significant
market share. The level of concentration varies, in some cases substantially, among the core markets in which
we operate and there exist further consolidation opportunities in markets where the concentration is still low
(for example in Italy). We also believe that, in part as a result of the above-mentioned significant selective
distribution requirements of brand manufacturers, the market share of large and omnichannel players with high
brand awareness has grown at the expense of smaller chains, as the market has progressively consolidated in
recent years.

Legal Framework of the Selective Distribution Model

See “Business—Regulatory Environment”, and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We may
_be adversely affected by changes in antitrust and competition laws and regulations, in particular with respect to_
_selective distribution contracts.”_

###### BUSINESS

Overview

We believe we are the leading premium beauty platform in Europe, with total Group sales of
€3,112.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) of €250.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €235.2 million in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The majority of our sales are generated within the selective beauty
distribution channel, which requires the formal authorization of a supplier to carry a selective product, as
opposed to the mass market channel. As of December 31, 2020, we operate in 26 European countries with
over 2,300 stores (including 141 franchised stores) in 20 countries and have e-commerce operations in 24
countries. According to the OC&C Market Review Update, in 2019 we held leading market positions in the
premium beauty market (top 1-2) in all of our core markets except for Spain where we held the number 3
position. In those six core countries, we generated 90.7% of our sales in the financial year 2019/2020. In the
financial year 2019/2020, we had an average number of 21,016 employees (salaried employees and excluding
apprentices).

We believe we operate the leading online beauty platform in our core markets in Europe, with highly
integrated brick & mortar stores and e-commerce customer interfaces which provide our customers with a
comprehensive omnichannel, one-stop shopping experience. In October 2019, we launched our beauty
marketplace in Germany, where we partner with third party retailers and brands to further expand our product
assortment without having to build up inventories. As of December 31, 2020, our marketplace featured 101
partners and offered nearly 84,000 SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). Our total
e-commerce sales amounted to €1,006.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020,
corresponding to 32.3% of our total sales. In the financial year 2019/2020, our e-commerce sales amounted to
€821.5 million, or 25.4% of our total sales, corresponding to a CAGR of 39.3% during the financial year
2017/2018 to 2019/2020. In Germany, our e-commerce sales comprised 39.9% of our total sales in the financial
year 2019/2020.

We primarily operate under the “Douglas” brand and under the “Nocibé” brand in France and
Monaco. With nearly 130,000 different SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including additional SKUs
from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace), we offer one of the industry’s largest beauty and
personal care product assortments available across a wide range of price points in both our brick & mortar and
online stores. This assortment is complemented by a range of beauty-related nutritional supplements,
accessories such as jewelry, home decorations and selected service offerings.

We believe that we distinguish ourselves with a customer-centric sales approach, by offering our
customers high quality advice and services. As a result, we have an extensive customer loyalty card program.
As of September 30, 2020, we had more than 44 million Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card holders across
Europe. We believe that several factors make us a “must-have” distribution platform for the major suppliers of
beauty products, such as our customer base, reputation, broad, well-invested store network in prime locations,
and e-commerce capabilities.

We believe we are an innovation leader in omnichannel beauty retailing in Europe and already at the
beginning of the financial year 2017/18, we launched our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy where we put our
online business at the center of our focus with the aim of becoming an integrated, data-based beauty platform.
As part of this strategy, we have successfully modernized our brand logo and store design and continue to
make investments in e-commerce. We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and have
started to implement the next phase, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next phase, we are
focusing even more on digitalization to create an integrated beauty platform and link our brick & mortar stores
and e-commerce capabilities. In doing so, we aim to provide a more holistic journey for our customers.

Competitive Strengths

We believe that our business is characterized by the following competitive strengths:

_Number one beauty destination in Europe_

With total Group sales of €3,112.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we believe
we are Europe’s leading beauty platform in our core countries. According to the OC&C Market Review Update,
in 2019 we held leading market positions in the premium beauty market (top 1-2) in all of our core markets
except for Spain where we hold the number 3 position. Our operations in our six core countries generated
90.7% of our sales in the financial year 2019/2020. In Germany, with an estimated market share of 26% in 2019,
we were the clear market leader in the premium beauty market in terms of sales. In France, with an estimated
market share of 16% in 2019, we held the number two position and believe that we have strong market

###### 135


-----

positions in most of our other markets. Based on the OC&C Market Review Update, we believe that in 2019, we
generated almost the same amount of sales in premium beauty products as our next three closest competitors
combined in our core markets. We had an estimated market share of 19% in our core markets as of
September 30, 2020.

Since the opening of the first Douglas perfumery in 1910 in Hamburg, we have evolved into a highly
trusted brand with a premium image that we believe has become synonymous with beauty in all of our core
markets. Our anchor brand “Douglas” benefits from leading brand awareness across our core markets (other
than France and Spain where we have the second highest brand awareness) with 95% awareness in Germany,
78% awareness in the Netherlands and 72% awareness in Italy and Poland, and our brand “Nocibé” benefits
from 80% brand awareness in France according to the OC&C Market Review, which together drive traffic to our
online shops and brick & mortar stores at low customer acquisition costs. We believe that customers see our
Douglas and Nocibé brands as a synonym for beauty and associate us with being premium, modern and
offering a large, diverse assortment. In addition, we believe that suppliers value our leading market position,
scale, customer reach and pan-European presence, which together make us the partner of choice for both
established and emerging brands as well as provide us with the purchasing power to constantly improve our
purchasing terms (such as higher year-end discounts).

_Leading online beauty platform in Europe_

We believe we are the number 1 European online beauty player in our core countries combined with a
strong presence in the fast growing online premium beauty market. As of December 31, 2020, our online
platform in Germany had nearly 130,000 different SKUs (in Germany, including additional SKUs from
Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace), and featured more than 1,800 brands (as of September 30,
2020), with over 365 new brands added in the financial year 2019/2020. In the financial year 2019/2020, total
visits for our dedicated Douglas App (in Germany, excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) exceeded
39 million. In total, we experienced over 474 million total visits during the financial year 2019/2020. Our
e-commerce sales have grown at a CAGR of over 29.2% in the last 8 years and a CAGR of 39.3% since the
financial year 2017/2018. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our e-commerce sales amounted
to €1,006.3 million, representing 32.3% of our total sales for the period.

We believe that we benefit from a growing base of recurring online customers and especially
omnichannel who have historically made stable revenue contributions and have continued to increase in
number even during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has
fundamentally changed customer behavior and further accelerated the shift towards online retailing even
outside of national lockdowns. For example, even though most of our stores were open from June to October
following the first wave of national lockdowns, our e-commerce sales increased from €219 million between
June 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 to €325 million between June 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 while our
e-commerce Adjusted EBITDA increased from €25 million between June 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 to
€48 million between June 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. In addition, in the financial year 2019/2020, our total
visits and active customers amounted to 474 million and 10 million, respectively, representing an increase of
39.3% and 40.6%, respectively, as compared to the previous year. In Germany in the financial year 2019/2020,
the share of sales (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, including VAT) attributable to mobile revenue
increased by 1.9 percentage points to 64.1% of our total e-commerce sales in Germany, including an increase
in the share of sales attributable to our Douglas App, which increased by 3.9 percentage points to 23.7% of our
total e-commerce sales in Germany. Over the same period in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty), our conversion rate, defined as the proportion of site visitors who complete the purchasing process,
among our Douglas Beauty Card holders remained relatively stable at 3.6% and the average e-commerce
basket size of Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, including
VAT and before sales deductions, which are in this specific case liabilities deducted from sales arising when
customers use points from their Douglas Beauty Cards earned through purchases to get products discounts or
vouchers on future purchases) increased by 9.8% to €65 as compared to the previous year. For the financial
year 2019/2020 in Germany, (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty), our average cost per online order
was €6.78, and our online acquisition cost decreased at a CAGR of 5.2% since the financial year 2017/2018.

We continue to invest in our e-commerce capabilities and in the financial year 2019/2020, launched
our “Douglas LIVE” shopping service where our beauty advisors, influencers and brand testimonials introduce
products via livestream that can be immediately purchased by customers as well as a “ship-from-store” delivery
option. To further complement our online platform, we launched the first dedicated European premium beauty
marketplace in October 2019 (initially in Germany, and in France and Austria in 2020) and generated total
platform sales of approximately €13 million in the first quarter 2020/2021. Through our marketplace, we
exclusively partner with third party retailers and brands to further expand our product assortment and revenue
streams and enter new product categories such as pharma beauty, jewelry, home accessories and fashion

###### 136


-----

without having to build up inventories or incur logistics costs. As of December 31, 2020, our marketplace
featured 101 partners including beauty suppliers like Talea, online pharmacies like apo-rot (belonging to the
Doc Morris Group), or vendors of accessories and jewelry like Brandfield, Butlers or Christ and offered nearly
84,000 different SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). In addition, we believe that our
marketplace boosts cross-selling through increased online traffic and provides additional data to improve our
data analytics and customer view. The marketplace function is currently active in our online shops in Germany,
Austria and France. It is expected to be rolled out to Poland in March 2021 and we are planning to add other
core markets such as the Netherlands and Italy in the financial year 2020/2021.

_Diversified leader with strong omnichannel operations in large, structurally growing and resilient European_
_beauty market_

The European premium beauty market in our core markets totaled €13.8 billion in 2019 and has
demonstrated resilience in challenging retail trading environments and partly through the COVID-19
pandemic. Beauty products (fragrances, skin care (including body care) and also color cosmetics) are often
perceived as accessible high-value gifts and so-called “personal rewards”, which has contributed to the
demand for such products remaining relatively stable. The market historically saw a balanced split between
product categories with skin and body care, fragrances, makeup and hair cosmetics accounting for 46%, 20%,
16% and 18% of the total market, respectively, in 2019. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic such
as the increased use of masks as well as working from home have led to an increase in our sales of skin and
body care products and a decrease in our sales of makeup products.

The European beauty market is increasingly shifting to the premium segment, with high margin luxury,
niche and prestige products accounting for 36% of the market in 2019. The European beauty market in our
core markets grew at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2015 and 2019 with the premium segment growing at a CAGR
of 2.9% over the same period. Within the premium segment, the share of e-commerce sales has more than
doubled in size between 2015 and 2019.

We believe that our intuitive and comprehensive omnichannel offering across our online and offline
channels makes us an attractive partner for suppliers and also well-placed to capitalize on growth in the
underlying European beauty market. We focus mainly on the premium beauty market, an attractive
sub-segment of the broader beauty and personal care market where manufacturers of premium brands limit
the distribution of their products to selected qualified retailers. Suppliers thus favor trusted retailers with strong
brand awareness who can offer appropriate brand presentation and store appearance, high levels of customer
service from specially trained employees, breadth of product assortment and broad customer and
geographical reach. As a result, we believe that the high integration of our online and mobile interfaces and
brick & mortar stores helps ensure that brands are positioned appropriately and make us an attractive partner
for suppliers.

In addition, we believe that customers in the beauty retail sector increasingly shop online to save time,
money and effort, but still wish to see, touch, feel, smell and test products in person in the store. To further
enhance our customer’s omnichannel shopping experience, we offer a number of highly integrated crosschannel services along various customer touch points, covering pre-sales information, stock availability,
consultation, payment as well as delivery of products and returns. These services include in-store orders, click &
collect, “ship from store” delivery, online stock information, online appointment scheduling before store visits
as well as cross-channel couponing. For the financial year 2019/2020, in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams
and Niche Beauty), our average return cycle in days was 2.49. In the financial year 2019/2020, the percentage
of customers who purchased additional products during click & collect was 18.9% (in Germany excluding
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty).

Among our Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty),
the share of our customers shopping via the omnichannel model has increased from 12.4% in the financial year
2016/2017 to 17.4% in the financial year 2019/2020. The share of customers shopping via the omnichannel was
approximately twice as high among customers who were beauty card holders aged 16-35 years old. In
addition, we believe that the omnichannel model increases customer engagement. For example, these
omnichannel customers have a higher order frequency and therefore annual sales than customers who use
only one channel. Among Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty) in the financial year 2019/2020, customer spend per year and number of purchases per year per
customer for our omnichannel customers was twice as high as compared to customers who shopped only
online or in our brick & mortar stores.

_Well-placed for future growth via differentiated #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy_

We believe we are an innovation leader in omnichannel beauty retailing in Europe and already at the
beginning of the financial year 2017/18, we launched our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy where we put our

###### 137


-----

online business at the center of our business with the aim of becoming an integrated, data-driven beauty
platform. The strategy was based on the following pillars and we believe repositioned us as a modern,
premium brand that is well-placed for future growth. We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY
strategy and have started to implement the next phase, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next
phase, we are focusing even more on digitalization to further develop integrated beauty platform and link our
brick & mortar stores and e-commerce capabilities. In doing so, we aim to provide a more holistic journey for
our customers. See “Strategy—Further implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst.”

_Brand positioning._ We rejuvenated the Douglas brand with a new, updated logo, more modern and
premium positioning as well as new visual brand language.

_Store experience._ We are developing our stores from being a point of sale to a point of experience
for customers. We have established store clusters and invested in related store modernizations in order to
facilitate a more tailored approach to each store’s assortment, visual presentation, services and pricing.
Formats range from flagship stores in high traffic locations in major cities that carry our full assortment and
feature premium visual merchandising, luxury stores in high-end locations that carry luxury and niche brands
and feature a more boutique design, prestige stores in premium neighborhoods that carry “must have” and
trend brands and feature a sophisticated design and premium stores in prime shopping locations that focus on
bestsellers and feature a more mainstream design. To enhance the “touch and feel” experience for customers,
each store format also features a range of services such as beauty treatments, hairdressing and beauty school
sessions. We believe that our new flagship stores, which have been established in key European cities such as
Frankfurt, Berlin, Milan, Madrid, Hamburg and Munich, provide a best-in-class customer experience with
features such as organic beauty products, niche perfumes, beauty lounges with treatment rooms as well as
dedicated customer service stations.

_Assortment._ We have a broad assortment, featuring nearly 130,000 different SKUs on our online
platform (in Germany, including additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace),
which represents over twice the number of SKUs offered by our closest competitor. Our attractive product
portfolio is balanced between fragrances, color cosmetics, skin care, and other products, which each
comprised approximately 48%, 23%, 27% and 2% of our total sales in Germany (including our marketplace,
excluding Swiss e-commerce, Parfumdreams, and Niche Beauty) for the financial year 2019/2020, respectively.
We feature many different major regional and international brands such as Chanel, Lancôme, Kiehl’s, The
Ordinary and Tom Ford sourced from suppliers with whom we maintain strong and often long-term
relationships. In addition, we complement our broad assortment of selective products with products from
exclusive brands such as Kylie Skin, Honest Beauty and Drunk Elephant and own brand products. In October
2019, we further bolstered our assortment with the launch in Germany of the first dedicated European
premium beauty marketplace from an omnichannel player, which as of December 31, 2020, contributed nearly
84,000 different SKUs (in Germany including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) through our third-party retail
and brand partners. We believe that properly curating our assortment is a key factor in customer retention and
continue to identify new product categories and source emerging brands via our trend scouting process.

_Customer relationship management._ We have an extensive customer loyalty card program, which we
believe is one of the largest among premium beauty in Europe. As of September 30, 2020, we had more than
44 million Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card holders across Europe. As part of our
#FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we have adopted a data-centric approach to our customer
relationship management. Using customer behavioral data collected from online purchases, use of our loyalty
card and our marketing channels, our customer relationship management analytics allow us to personalize all
future customer interactions across all channels by clustering customers into segments and providing them
with tailored product recommendations, product news and other content. We believe that such personalized
curation drives customer loyalty. In the financial year 2019/2020 in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and
Niche Beauty), the number of purchases per year per customer was 3.0 for Douglas Beauty Card holders and
5.4 for Douglas Beauty Card holders who used the Douglas App. Over the same period in Germany (excluding
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty and including VAT), the average spend per customer was €52.1 for Douglas
Beauty Card holders and €53.4 for Douglas Beauty Card holders who used the Douglas App (compared to
€50.8 for all customers in Germany). In addition, our customer interaction rates on our e-commerce platform
have significantly increased, with our average daily social media reach (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty) amounting to 3.1 million in the financial year 2018/2019 and increasing to 8.0 million in the financial
year 2019/2020. For the financial year 2020, in Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, we had average
online traffic of over 500,000 customers per day.

_Technology._ We believe that our established technological infrastructure, comprised of our seamless
and comprehensive omnichannel offering across online and offline channels, our state-of-the-art supply chain
and flexible logistics network and our data-driven customer relationship management system, has enabled us
to cope with changing customer behavior, in particular, the shift towards online retailing, which has accelerated
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have updated our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and are now implementing the next phase, known
as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. See “—Strategy—Further implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst
_strategy” below._

_Solid financial profile with strong momentum before COVID-19 that achieved market share gains in last_
_financial year_

We believe that we demonstrated the resilience of our business during the COVID-19 pandemic,
having achieved segment share gains in the total premium beauty market across our core markets in both our
online and store channels, including increases in overall segment share of 1.6 percentage points to 45.5% in
Germany, 1.6 percentage points to 28.3% in France, 0.1 percentage points to 11.8% in Spain and 0.5
percentage points to 24.6% in Italy for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the
previous year (excluding certain competitors such as Amazon e-commerce and Flaconi in Germany).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our consolidated sales had consistently grown over the last 8 years,
supported by organic growth, strategic acquisitions and the implementation of our #FORWARDBEAUTY
strategy, and our total consolidated sales amounted to €3.45 billion in the financial year 2018/2019. Bolstered
by investments and initiatives undertaken in 2017 such as a new pricing strategy in Germany to optimize our
price positioning, cost optimization measures aimed at maximizing operational efficiencies, achieving cost
discipline and right-sizing our existing store portfolio as well as significant brand investments to increase sales
of our own brand products and increase exclusive brand partnerships, our like-for-like total Group sales grew
1.9% from the financial year 2017/2018 to the financial year 2018/2019. In addition, we exhibit strong
underlying free cash flow generation due to our high margins, low capital expenditures comprised mainly of
investments in stores and central organizational functions and strict working capital management.

The chart below sets out our Adjusted EBITDA margin, net sales, net sales growth and like-for-like
sales growth for the periods indicated.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum differs from Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) in our historical
consolidated financial statements. The chart shows margins for Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) up to financial year
2014/2015; and from financial year 2015/2016 onwards, the chart shows Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e. margin for
Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) post credit card fees and bad debt). See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

(2) Includes accounting for foreign exchange rates.

We have acted quickly in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to preserve the strength of our
business. For example, we have worked to preserve business continuity and cash flow generation by
implementing health and safety measures across all our stores in accordance with government guidelines,
focusing on store-to-customer delivery in our core market of Germany and significantly expanding our
e-commerce capabilities through establishing a call center for online shoppers, increasing customer
engagement through push notifications on our Douglas App as well as offering click & collect services in the
second wave of lockdowns. We believe that our response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the shift in
customer demand to e-commerce have resulted in like-for-like sales for e-commerce increasing by 58.2% for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the previous year and our total e-commerce
sales exceeding €1 billion for the first time in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our
brick & mortar gross profit margin remained relatively stable from 46.4% in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 to 45.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 while our e-commerce gross

###### 139


-----

profit margin also remained relatively stable from 41.0% to 40.8% over the same period. While our brick &
mortar Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 14.4% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to
10.3% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our e-commerce Adjusted EBITDA margin increased
from 14.6% to 16.2% over the same period.

We are also actively managing our liquidity needs though strict cost and cash management and
reporting, negotiating rent for our leased premises and taking advantage of rent deferrals where available,
actively managing personnel expenses and working with suppliers to extend payments terms and manage
returns. As a result, excluding proceeds from our drawdown of our existing revolving credit facility, our cash on
balance sheet amounted to €90.8 million as of September 30, 2020 as compared to €81.0 million (excluding
proceeds from our drawdown of our existing revolving credit facility) as of September 30, 2019.

_Experienced and committed management team with strong sponsor support_

We have an experienced executive management team with more than 70 years of combined
experience in the retail industry, the cosmetics industry and in e-commerce, including our CEO Tina Müller,
who has been with us since 2017 and initiated our differentiated #FORWARDBEAUTY and
#FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategies, Matthias Born who has been our CFO since 2019, Vanessa Stützle,
our Chief Digital Officer who has been responsible for our online business and customer relationship
management since 2018 and Dr. Michael Keppel, our Chief Restructuring Officer who joined us in July 2020.
Tina Müller has more than 20 years of experience in the cosmetics industry and previously held international
executive positions at Wella and Henkel. Matthias Born was previously the CFO / COO of CBR Fashion and has
over 10 years of dedicated experience in retail. Vanessa Stützle is the former Chief Digital Officer of the s.Oliver
Group and has over 14 years of experience in the field of retail digitization and e-commerce. Dr. Michael
Keppel has over 25 years of restructuring experience, especially in the wholesale and retail industry. We
believe that our management team has successfully transformed us over the past few years from a traditional,
brick & mortar beauty retailer into a modern, technology and data-driven beauty platform that is a leading
beauty destination in Europe.

We continue to have strong shareholder support, including from CVC, a leading private equity and
investment advisory firm with approximately U.S.$109 billion assets under management and over
U.S.$160 billion of committed funds. To support the Transaction, CVC and the Founder Co-Investors, the Kreke
family, will indirectly contribute equity of €220 million.

Strategy

In order to achieve sustainable growth and further increase our profitability, we focus on clearly
defined key strategic objectives, leveraging the various strategic and operational measures we have
implemented. Our strategic goals can be summarized as follows:

_Further implement #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst_

We have updated our successful #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy and intend to implement the next
stage, known as #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst. In this next phase, we are focusing on further digitalization in
order to create a holistic journey for our customers that spans across an integrated beauty platform that
intuitively links our brick & mortar stores and e-commerce platform. Our strategy is comprised of the following
elements:

_Brand Positioning:_ As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, we rejuvenated and upgraded the
Douglas brand. We continue to focus on our positioning as a premium brand. In addition, we believe that
strong niche brands like Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty complement our brand portfolio and attract different
customer groups.

_Store experience._ As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, we began developing our stores from
being a point of sale to a point of experience for customers and are continuing to invest in store
modernizations and formats.

_Assortment._ We believe that our broad assortment, which amounted to nearly 130,000 different
SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in Germany, including additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and
our marketplace), differentiates us from our competitors and will continue to build our relationships with
suppliers with the aim of being their partner of choice for their top brands. We will also continue to add
partners to our marketplace in order to strengthen our online platform as a one-stop-shop for beauty for our
customers. We also intend to selectively enter new product categories that we believe are suitable for our
business model such as the health and wellbeing segment.

###### 140


-----

_Supply chain transformation._ We are in the process of centralizing and streamlining our supply chain
by integrating our physical and digital supply chain. We are moving towards a OWAC approach to physical
supply chain where each of our logistic facilities will service our physical stores and e-commerce platform as
well as handle partner fulfillment for our marketplace by carrying up to 150,000 SKUs per site. We intend to
anchor our logistics operations with five distribution centers across Europe and in December 2020, started
construction on the first site in Germany, which is fixed with ARVATO to serve the region Germany (excluding
Niche Beauty), Austria, Switzerland the Netherlands (which based on sales represented approximately 50% of
the Group’s supply chain) which is expected to ship out its first orders in 2022. We currently expect that all five
facilities will be owned, staffed and managed by third party logistics partners and thus will require no material
capital expenditures. In addition, we began in December 2020 to digitalize our entire supply chain
management with AI-powered forecasting and replenishment software with machine learning algorithms from
RELEX solutions that we believe will enable us to increase product availability, improve inventory allocation,
accelerate stock rotation in stores, improve labor productivity in stores and logistics facilities, and improve the
impact of our marketing campaigns. The new system is currently being implemented in Germany and we
expect the full transformation of our supply chain management to be complete in the next three years.

_Data hub._ Data is the key element of our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy. We have
developed and with each additional customer transaction, are continuing to build a Douglas data hub that
collects data from our stores, our customer relationship management system, our website, our Douglas App
and retail and marketplace data, as well as our performance marketing data. We intend to use this growing
collection of data to train our machine learning algorithms, which in turn will enable us to manage our internal
processes more efficiently, improve individualized customer offers and ultimately drive profitability.

_Curation/CRM._ We will continue to build and refine our data-centric customer relationship
management system, which will enable us to deliver 1:1 marketing to customers by harmonizing customer data
and customer journey tracking to allow more personalized curation across all channels in order to drive higher
conversion rates and increase basket sizes. For example, we have introduced features such as individualized
product news, beauty tips and product recommendations in our personalized newsletter (of which we sent
over 1.2 billion copies across Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain in the financial year 2019/2020), a
personalized start page when customers visit our online shop, replenishment reminders and personalized push
notifications through our Douglas App.

_Complement accelerating e-commerce channel with Store Optimization Program_

We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the shift towards online retailing. As
a result, in the summer of 2020, we began to reevaluate our store network based on economic viability and
strategic fit in a post-COVID-19 “new normal”. Following a top-down and detailed bottom-up analysis of our
store network supported by external experts, we have created our SOP to actively improve profitability of our
store network. Our SOP target is to close approximately 500 stores by the end of September 2022 across our
network with a focus on Southern Europe, where there is a high store density within numerous catchment areas
due to our historical acquisitions. To implement the SOP optimally and ensure well-managed store closures, we
have developed detailed operational playbooks. We also have established a dedicated external team that
reports directly to our CRO and engages with our country implementation teams to ensure that best practices
are shared, and progress is tracked. In addition, we are in the process of optimizing staffing levels at our stores
to improve efficiency and react to the reduction in store traffic as well as COVID-19-inflicted changes in
customer behavior. As part of our SOP, we are also targeting rent improvements and intend to actively
re-negotiate leases with our landlords for stores that will remain open. Based on the various elements of our
SOP, we have identified potential for an overall improvement in our EBITDA of approximately €100 million as
well as one-off net cash requirements (excluding any additional legal and consulting fees) of approximately
€53 million by the end of the financial year 2021/2022. These costs have been reflected to a smaller degree in
our financial statements, as the SOP was announced in January 2021, but execution has partially started
beforehand.

_Launch #ForwardOrganization in line with digital first strategy_

In line with our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we intend to implement
#ForwardOrganization, which aims to standardize, harmonize and centralize aspects of our internal functions in
order to improve efficiency and realize synergies across regions. As a first step, we have started the
centralization of certain key functions such as e-commerce, customer relationship management and pricing. In
connection with #ForwardOrganization, we have identified the potential for an overall improvement in our
EBITDA of approximately €18-20 million as well as one-off cash effects (excluding any additional legal and
consulting fees) of approximately €25 million.

Recent Acquisitions

In November 2017, we completed the acquisition of 103 stores and the e-commerce platform of
Perfumerias If, one of the leading perfumery and cosmetic chains in Spain (including Andorra). In November
2017, we also acquired Limoni S.p.A. (“Limoni”) and La Gardenia Beauty S.p.A. (“La Gardenia”), two leading
Italian beauty and perfumery chains which together comprised approximately 500 stores across Italy. We
believe that the acquisition made us a leading premium beauty player in Italy in 2018 and solidified our
position in the Italian beauty sector, further bolstering our pan-European footprint.

In August 2018, we acquired an 80.0% interest in Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH (“Parfumdreams”),
which comprised an online shop and brick & mortar stores in Germany. We believe that the acquisition further
bolstered our e-commerce platform. The remaining 20% of Parfumdreams is subject to several put and call
options, including a put option held by the seller that expires at the end of 2021 and a put and call option that
can be triggered by certain defaults.

In July 2019, we acquired a 51.0% interest in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH (“Niche Beauty”), an emerging
online portal for luxury, niche and trend cosmetic brands. We believe that the acquisition of Niche Beauty
strengths our premium and niche assortment and aligns with our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy. We expect to
acquire the remaining 49.0% interest in Niche Beauty in the next two years.

Product Offering and Assortment

_Product Categories_

Our main product categories are fragrances, skin & body care, color cosmetics (i.e., make-up) and hair
cosmetics. We also offer complementary product categories relating to, for example, “living” (home
accessories, such as home textiles, dishware or decoration articles) and “accessories” (for example, scarves and
fashion jewelry). In response to new trends relating to medical brands, natural brands and nutritional
supplements, we created the new product category “beauty food”, which are food supplements focusing on
beauty from within.

We aim to address all price levels and all relevant customer types through our comprehensive
portfolio with a particular focus on fragrance and beauty products.

The following chart provides an overview of our main product categories and their respective
sub-categories:

Fragrances Skin Care Color Cosmetics Hair Cosmetics Beauty Food Others

Women Body Lips Care Skin Bath & Shower
Men

Nails

Face Deodorants Living

Eyes Complexion Styling Nails & Hair

Unisex Hand & Foot Sun Other Accessories

Paintbrush Tools Beauty & Sleep

Care Professional beauty

Accessories

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced and are continuing to experience shifts in the mix of
products purchased by our customers, which we attribute to the hygiene measures implemented to reduce the
spread of COVID-19. These measures include the widespread wearing of masks and the increased prevalence
of working from home. For example, we experienced a higher share of sales from skin and body care, while
sales attributable to make-up decreased.

_Fragrances_

Fragrances have been our largest product category in the financial year 2019/2020, with a slightly
increasing contribution of approximately 48% of sales in Germany (including our marketplace, excluding Swiss
e-commerce, Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). Our sales are typically driven by female fragrance products.
While eau de cologne, eau de toilettes and eau de parfum account for the vast majority of our sales from this
product category, auxiliary products such as bath lines and shower gel or body care products (which, for
example, may be included as part of a gift set in combination with a fragrance) represent an additional small
portion of the sales from fragrances.

Our product portfolio comprises a comprehensive assortment of fragrances for women and men as
well as unisex fragrances. The focus of our fragrance offering is on fragrances from established beauty brands,
premium and luxury fragrances, including fragrances by Chanel, Dior, YvesSaintLaurent, Tom Ford, Givenchy,

###### 142


-----

and Guerlain, as well as fragrances of so-called famous faces, lifestyle and sports fragrances, niche, trendy and
designer fragrances. Furthermore, our product portfolio includes so-called “masstige” (i.e., affordable products
intended for the mass market, but which through packaging and other characteristics are perceived as being
prestige products) and, to a lesser degree, mass fragrance products.

_Skin Care_

We offer a full range of skin care products, including day creams, night creams, serums, masks, tonics,
firming and slimming products and auxiliary products such as cleansers, as well as sun protection. In the
financial year 2019/2020, skin care products accounted for approximately 27% of our total sales in Germany
(including our marketplace, excluding Swiss e-commerce, Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). The vast majority
of our sales in this category are generated by women’s skin care products in general and women’s face care
products in particular. Men’s skin care products have gained importance and we expect this trend to continue
due to the more pronounced awareness of men regarding their personal appearance. A further trend relates to
increasing product differentiation, such as natural cosmetics or hybrid, multi-benefit skin care products (e.g.
products combining the benefits of skin care and make-up into one).

Our portfolio includes products from established beauty brands, premium and luxury skin care
brands, such as La Prairie, La Mer, Sensai, Augustinus Bader, Dr. Barbara Sturm, Sisley and MBR. We also offer
designer skin care brands (such as Chanel and Christian Dior), skin expert brands, brands specialized in
wellness/natural products and some masstige and mass brands. In the skin care segment, we strive to increase
the share of our own brand products in our overall sales to attract younger and new customer groups. For
example, we successfully launched the doctor brand “Dr. Susanne von Schmiedeberg” across Europe, and the
clean beauty brand “One.two.free!”.

_Color Cosmetics_

Our color cosmetics portfolio comprises a comprehensive range of cosmetic products for lips, such as
lip sticks and lip glosses, nail products, such as nail polish and nail care products, eyes cosmetics, such as
mascaras, eye shadows and eyeliners, complexion cosmetics, such as liquid make-up, concealer and compact
powder and make-up accessories, such as make-up brushes. Color cosmetics generated about 23% of our total
sales in Germany (including our marketplace, excluding Swiss e-commerce, Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty)
in the financial year 2019/2020. Our most significant color cosmetics sub-category in terms of sales is
complexion, followed by eye cosmetics, lips and the rapidly growing nails category.

We offer a full range of color cosmetics, with a focus on established beauty brands, premium and
luxury color cosmetics (including from Mac, Benefit, Artdeco and Lancôme), artist and specialist products as
well as our exclusive brands like It Cosmetics and Neonaill. In addition, we offer masstige and mass products
and natural color cosmetic products. Our offering also includes numerous color cosmetic products from our
own brands, for example, “Douglas Make-up” and “Nocibé Artiste”, which generally aim at the premium price
level.

_Hair Cosmetics_

We offer a select range of hair cosmetics products for regular use, such as shampoos, conditioners,
treatments, hair tonics, products for nurturing the scalp, styling products and tools, brushes and combs as well
as coloration.

_Beauty Food_

In January 2019, we launched our Beauty Food category and introduced a new category of beauty
food products such as food supplements and our “#INNERBEAUTY” brand of nutritional supplements, which
range from liquids to tablets and beauty gummy bears as well as shots with concentrated ingredients.

_Other Products_

We offer a select range of complementary products under our own brands, third-party brands or as
unbranded articles, to extend our core product portfolio. Sales of such other products represented
approximately 2% of our total sales in Germany (including our marketplace, excluding Swiss e-commerce,
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) in the financial year 2019/2020.

Besides typical auxiliary beauty and personal care products, such as make-up and hair accessories,
bath and shower products, deodorants and gift sets, this category also includes professional beauty products,
such as electrical skin cleaning brushes, home accessories, such as home textiles, dishware or decoration

###### 143


-----

articles, and personal accessories, such as scarves and fashion or costume jewelry. In addition, we offer special
seasonal and themed products, such as Christmas or Easter decorations or products relating to particular
events. Some of the products in our “other products” category are partially offered via our marketplace in order
to complement our own offerings.

We believe that our complementary product portfolio strengthens our beauty competence, and
theme-related or seasonal products constitute “small extras” that are often purchased by customers in addition
to other beauty products.

_Product Types_

We have extensive product type offerings comprising a mix of selective, exclusive and own brand
products with which we target different segments within the European beauty and personal care market.

_Selective Products_

Selective products are fragrances, skin & body care and color cosmetics products from third-party,
mostly premium brands sold only by selective retailer partners, which are our most important product type and
a key traffic builder for us. As part of our selective product offering, we market a full range of fragrances, skin &
body care and color cosmetics products with a wide array of major national and international brands. The
distribution of selective products is limited to selected retailers which have to meet specific qualitative and
quantitative criteria. For more information, see “—Operations: Suppliers and Supply Chain Management,
_Logistics, and Information Technology—Suppliers and Supply Chain Management—Suppliers”._

We believe that the top brand suppliers consider us as an important strategic partner in the European
selective beauty retail markets in which we operate, particularly in our six core countries. We also believe that
our core strength lies in the fact that we offer a broad and comprehensive assortment of products from
different brands, through a dense network of brick & mortar and online stores.

_Exclusive Products_

We offer certain brands exclusively or are granted exclusive rights to offer such products in certain
countries. Exclusive brands are an important source of differentiation vis-à-vis competitors. Exclusive products
typically have higher margins than other selective products while also contributing to increase customer loyalty.

In Germany and France alone, in the financial year 2019/2020, our exclusive offering included more
than 95 brands that range across all of our product categories. In Germany, we exclusively offered products
from nearly 60 different brands. In addition, Nocibé’s exclusive offering in France comprised products from
more than 50 brands.

Exclusivity is typically granted for one or two years, particularly for newer brands, in order to be able to
retain flexibility, and a somewhat longer period (for example, three years) in the case of certain exclusive
products of well-established brands. In many other respects, including the sourcing process, exclusive
products are similar to the other selective products and are often provided by some of the same suppliers. We
typically share part of the marketing costs for such products with the supplier and receive attractive tester/
sample packages relating to these exclusive products. Potential exclusive partners typically value the possibility
to cooperate and further develop their brand with us as their exclusive partner, due to our leading market
positions in many of the countries in which we operate and the advantages of having a single distribution
channel.

Our exclusive products are selected on the basis of a trend scouting process and a related brand
assessment that analyzes whether a potential new exclusive product fits well within our brand and assortment
strategy. We are receptive to proposals from the products’ suppliers and also approach suppliers pro-actively
when we identify a product or type of product that we consider to be attractive to offer on an exclusivity basis.
Among the criteria that we consider when assessing potential exclusive products are brand awareness,
estimated sales and margin prospects, differentiation from competitors, the potential to attract new customers
or reinforce the loyalty of existing customers and the period for which exclusivity is granted. In some cases,
exclusive products are distributed only through our e-commerce platform. This allows us to test how a product
performs before extending the partnership to our stores.

_“Own Brands” including our “Douglas Collection” products_

Our category of own brands includes both “Douglas” and “Nocibé” labeled products, as well as an
attractive, innovative and growing range of brands that we own, but that are neither called Douglas nor Nocibé

###### 144


-----

but are positioned independently. Recent examples include the doctor skin care brand “Dr. Susanne von
Schmiedeberg”/Dermacosmetics and our “#INNERBEAUTY” brand of nutritional supplements.

Our “Douglas Brand” products, which focus on color cosmetics, body care, skin care and accessories,
are positioned in the premium price segment. We believe our own brand products also help increase store
traffic, and are more “trend-oriented” targeting, in particular, new and younger customers, thereby
rejuvenating and broadening our target customer base and image. Furthermore, our own brand products that
are not branded Douglas or Nocibé, such as “One.two.free!” or “Dr. Susanne von Schmiedeberg”/
Dermacosmetics, enable us to move our own brand products into higher price segments with higher price
points, which in turn drives higher margins. In the financial year 2019/2020, our own brand products accounted
for 6.6% of our total sales.

While we do not manufacture or develop any products ourselves, we cooperate with manufacturers
and suppliers of our own brand products, who, in some cases manufacture the product exclusively for us.

We source our own brand products from a diversified portfolio of suppliers in Europe and Asia, in
order to facilitate price benchmarking and assist with negotiations. Generally, we engage the same suppliers as
large established beauty brands to ensure the requisite product quality. Before selecting a supplier for a new
own brand product, we compare the price and quality of the product from at least two potential suppliers. We
also apply strict quality standards to our own brand products. Our sourcing is based on an order-by-order
concept, where we select our suppliers and enter into individual contracts for each own brand product or
product line. Such contracts are usually entered into for an indefinite period and may typically be terminated
with six-months’ notice.

Our sourcing contracts set demanding standards and incorporate provisions that require the supplier
to comply with applicable laws and carry out certain tests relating to product safety while other tests are carried
out by our own product managers in cooperation with third parties. In addition, depending on the designated
specification of the product, we may demand further tests be executed by the respective suppliers and/or
third-party testing facilities, for example to measure how effective products are (e.g., the moisturizing qualities
of a product), how the product might respond to transportation, and how appropriate product labeling might
be ensured. We currently implement a process to audit all new own brand suppliers and existing suppliers
every two years. In the event of repeated non-conforming products or other difficulties, we audit our suppliers
as required.

_Beauty Services_

In the past, we introduced various formats for beauty services and continuously experimented with
new service offerings. Our stores offer some services to customers free of charge as part of our overall service
offerings (for example, five-minute make-up, skin type advice and quick nail polishing). Many stores also
provide professional manicure and make-up services. In certain stores we offer even more extended beauty
treatments, such as hairdressers or beauty centers/spas. In France, most of our Nocibé stores are equipped
with beauty cabins.

_Product Assortment Strategy, Product Development and Trend Scouting_

Our strategy regarding product assortment is two-fold: while our new in-store concept is based on
offering bestsellers and new brands which positively influence the image of the Douglas brand, we strive to
further expand our already comprehensive offering online of nearly 130,000 SKUs as of December 31, 2020 (in
Germany, including additional SKUs from Parfumdreams, Niche Beauty and our marketplace) in the coming
years, with the goal of offering our customers the broadest product range in the European beauty market. This
strategy allows us to address the different demands of our customers with a representative product assortment
in our brick & mortar stores and a broader assortment online. As a result of our cross-channel capabilities, our
online product portfolio is accessible to our store personnel, who can order products physically unavailable in
the relevant store and have them delivered either to the store or directly to the customer.

Our brick & mortar assortment concept is based on a modular store system, including dedicated
concepts for small, medium-sized and large stores, which allows for a high degree of automation in supply
management (with benefits such as the automation of replenishment of stock, less resource used ordering
out-of-stock products of our permanent portfolio in the individual stores and less stock-outs), yet includes
enough flexibility to cater to the specific needs of certain stores.

We see ourselves as an innovation leader in the beauty and personal care industry, introducing many
of the latest trends and new products into the European market for beauty and personal care products. In
addition to the introduction of new products, we constantly aim to further develop and enhance our beauty

###### 145


-----

and customer services offerings in our brick & mortar stores and online. Due to the complexity of, and the
dynamic changes in the global beauty market, we have established an international competence center, where
we have concentrated our corresponding expertise, essential for discovering and evaluating the latest
customer trends and needs in the context of the overall beauty and lifestyle environment. Assortment decisions
are made by our country purchasing directors, who are experienced in their respective markets and ensure
such decisions are in line with our central assortment category management and supported by market
analyses. We have a dedicated trend scouting team which constantly assesses new innovative brands and
products and cooperates with a global trend scouting agency. Recent examples of products we have
introduced include Fragrance of Shirin David, Skincare Florence by Mills as well as the European wide exclusive
launch of Kylie Skin by Kylie Jenner in 2020.

Sales Channels, Omnichannel Approach and Payment Methods

We operate both through an extensive network of over 2,300 stores in 20 countries across Europe,
which includes primarily directly operated stores, but also franchised stores (see “—Our Store Network” below)
and through our e-commerce activities with online shops in 24 countries.

The following table provides an overview over the number of stores, the online shops, both as of
December 31, 2020, and the year of our market entry in the markets in which we operate:

(1) Number of stores including franchised stores.

(2) Including 122 franchised stores.

(3) Including 19 franchised stores.

_Our Store Network_

We operate an extensive, modern and well-invested retail network comprising 2,230 directly operated
stores and 141 franchised stores in 20 European countries, as of December 31, 2020. We target highly
frequented locations for our stores such as city centers and shopping malls. In terms of geographical spread,
we operate in many European cities, primarily in urban locations, and have nationwide coverage in our key
markets of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland.

As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, we are developing our stores from being a point of sale
to a point of experience for customers. We have established store clusters and invested in related store
modernization measures, in order to facilitate a more tailored approach to each store’s assortment, visual
presentation, services and pricing. Formats range from: (i) flagship stores in high traffic locations in major cities

###### 146


-----

that carry our full assortment and feature premium visual merchandising, (ii) luxury stores in high-end locations
that carry luxury and niche brands and feature a more boutique design, (iii) prestige stores in premium
neighborhoods that carry “must have” and trend brands and feature a sophisticated design and (iv) premium
stores in prime shopping locations that focus on bestsellers and feature a more mainstream design. To
enhance the “touch and feel” experience for customers, each store format also features a range of services
such as beauty treatments, hairdressing and beauty school sessions. We believe that our new flagship stores,
which have been established in key European cities such as Frankfurt, Berlin, Milan, Madrid, Hamburg and
Munich, provide a best-in-class customer experience with features such as organic beauty products, niche
perfumes, beauty lounges and treatment rooms as well as dedicated customer service stations. For example, in
June 2020, we opened our largest flagship store in Munich, which features a pilot project that allows us to test
new store concepts, beauty services and products with customers before being rolled out to other stores. We
are also testing new store formats such as Douglas PRO, a store dedicated to outer and inner beauty, with a
greater focus on skin care and medical beauty. Our first Douglas PRO store opened in Hamburg in September
2018, and the format is also present in our ecommerce shop. Our brick & mortar conversion rate grew by 7.8%
to 35.0% for the financial year 2019/2020. The average basket for our brick & mortar stores also grew by 4.5%
to approximately €46 in the financial year 2019/2020.

We also operate franchised stores, primarily in France, where approximately half of such stores are
located in the French overseas territories, but also in the Netherlands. We believe the franchised store concept
helps us with entering new catchment areas outside of our own network. While our franchisees in the
Netherlands operate between one and three stores, approximately 80% of our franchisees owned only one
store. In France, franchisees operate between one and seven stores (with the exception of one franchisee
operating 21 stores), as of December 31, 2020. Approximately half of our French franchisees owned only one
store. We consider our franchise network as being complementary to our own stores. For example, in France
the franchised stores complement our network of owned stores to ensure a nationwide footprint.

The standard length of a franchise contract is five years, typically including a renewal clause for our
benefit. Our franchise contracts grant the franchisee the right to operate a store using the Nocibé store brand
(in France) and the Douglas brand (in the Netherlands). The franchisees in France have their own purchasing
processes with suppliers under the commercial conditions negotiated by us and—except for own brands and
certain exclusive products—we do not sell any products to them; however, in other countries, we do supply our
franchisees with other products. We normally provide certain commercial and marketing assistance to our
franchisees (such as coordinating store window displays during the Christmas or Mother’s Day period). Most of
our franchise contracts provide us with preemption rights to purchase the store in case a sale is envisaged by
the franchisee. The criteria that we consider when deciding whether to purchase a franchised store or not
includes the sales of such store, store location, the number of customers, profitability and the length of time
that the store has been our franchise.

We review our store portfolio on an on-going basis in order to systematically enhance our network of
stores. In light of the shift in customer behavior towards online retailing, which has been accelerated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, we have launched our SOP. Our SOP targets closing approximately 500 stores by the
end of September 2022 across our network but with a focus on Southern Europe, where our sales from brick &
mortar stores were particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and where there is currently high overlap
in store locations due to our historical acquisitions. See “Business—Strategy—Complement accelerating
_e-commerce channel with Store Optimization Program”._

During the period from October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020, we added 454 own stores to our
network on a net basis (including stores that were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Limoni and La
Gardenia in Italy as well as Bodybell and Perfumerias If in Spain and Andorra). The net increase of 454 stores
resulted from 110 new store openings, 629 store acquisitions and the closure of 285 stores. Although we are
reducing the overall number of our brick & mortar stores, we aim to selectively open stores in attractive
catchment areas, especially in Eastern Europe, which we view as a growth market.

_Our E-Commerce Platform_

We believe we operate the leading online beauty platform in our core markets in Europe with online
shops in 24 different European countries. Our e-commerce sales amounted to €423.3 million in the financial
year 2017/2018, €584.1 million in the financial year 2018/2019, €821.5 million in the financial year 2019/2020
and €1,006.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, representing 12.9%, 16.9%, 25.4% and
32.3% of total sales, respectively.

We are committed to continuously improving our online shops with a focus on enhanced user
experience. For example, our shop has been responsive since 2018. In February 2021, we relaunched our
online shop in Germany on the new cloud-based SAP Hybris platform, with further UX and UI improvements, as
part of a “mobile first” approach. Sales via mobile devices, including via the Douglas App, comprised 64.1%

###### 147


-----

and 23.7% of our e-commerce revenue in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) respectively,
for the financial year 2019/2020. In the financial year 2019/2020, we launched our “Douglas LIVE” shopping
service, a social commerce channel within our online shop where influencers, beauty advisors and employees
present products and trends via livestream that can be immediately purchased by our customers.

Our e-commerce sales category mix is similar to the stores mix, with fragrances comprising
approximately 37.1% of sales in the financial year 2019/2020, followed by skin care with approximately 34.2%,
color cosmetics (make-up) with approximately 26.1%, and other products with approximately 2.7%, based on
our sales in Germany (including our marketplace, excluding Swiss e-commerce, Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty), the Netherlands and Poland. However, our online portfolio comprises more products than our storebased offering, since our brick & mortar stores are subject to space constraints.

In Germany, our e-commerce and omnichannel customers are on average younger than our store-only
customers (based on an analysis of our Douglas Beauty Card holders). In the financial year 2019/2020 based
on Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, our German
e-commerce business exceeded a customer retention rate of 64%, the average order size was approximately
€65 and the order frequency was approximately three orders per financial year per customer. Customer
retention rate for Douglas Beauty Card holders is defined as the percentage of active customers who have
been active before a given period. For the same period, our average delivery costs for online orders amounted
to approximately 10% of net sales.

_Our Marketplace_

In October 2019, we launched our beauty marketplace in Germany, where we partner with third party
retailers and brands to further expand our product assortment and revenue streams and enter new product
categories such as pharma beauty, jewelry, home accessories and fashion without having to build up
inventories or incur logistics costs. Furthermore, we also use the stock of partners to backfill our products which
are out of stock. Through our marketplace, we list products from third party suppliers and brands and we put
their prices on our online shop. If a customer orders a product, we process the payment and then in turn order
that product from the relevant third-party partner. Products are then delivered directly by our partners to the
end customer. The marketplace is fully integrated into our existing e-commerce framework and provides
customers with a seamless shopping experience. Our partners are solely responsible for the sourcing and
supply of products. In addition, our marketplace also provides us with indirect revenue streams via media sales,
such as sponsored product ads on our e-commerce platform or external media campaigns that use our
customer data. We may in the future add other sources of indirect revenue such as charging a fee to handle
order fulfillment for the marketplace.

As of December 31, 2020, our marketplace in Germany featured 101 partners including beauty
suppliers like Talea, online pharmacies like apo-rot (belonging to the Doc Morris Group), or vendors of
accessories and jewelry like Brandfield, Butlers or Christ and offered nearly 84,000 different SKUs (in Germany
including Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty). Our partners are carefully vetted and must meet high quality
standards. The marketplace function is currently active in our online shops in Germany, Austria and France. It is
expected to be rolled out to Poland in March 2021 and other core markets such as the Netherlands and Italy in
the financial year 2020/2021.

_Omnichannel Approach_

Our omnichannel approach is focused on providing customers with a seamless shopping experience
across all available retail channels, including brick & mortar stores, mobile internet devices, computers, and in
relation to marketing activities, including television, radio, mailings and social media. In order to address and
track customers tastes and shopping patterns through a variety of channels, we use an omnichannel approach
and offer cross-channel activities that include, for example, integrated databases of products, prices and
promotions, and integrated interfaces linking mobile/online applications, the brick & mortar stores and logistic
processes. In addition, by tracking customer behavior such as purchase patterns, website visits and use of our
Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card through our data-driven customer relationship management platform, we
are able to build efficient marketing tools tailored to each customer, provide one-to-one communication with
our customers and optimize our supply chain.

One major advantage for our omnichannel customers is the ability to get advice and other services or
test products directly in the store, while ordering additional products from our full online product assortment
which customers can access via online/mobile features in the store itself (or conveniently from the office or
home) and have them delivered to their home address or to the store, in some cases on the same day if
ordered in time. We believe that this ability to “touch and feel” our products in our stores remains a key
competitive advantage against the increasing competition from pure-play online retailers, who cannot offer a
similar shopping experience. As part of our updated #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we are

###### 148


-----

continuing to invest in e-commerce in order to offer an integrated cross-channel service to customers covering
pre-sales information, stock availability, consultation, payment and product delivery. Such services include
in-store orders, click & collect, ship from store, online stock information, online appointment scheduling before
store visits and cross-channel couponing.

_Payment Methods_

We offer a number of customary payment methods tailored to meet our local customers’ payment
preferences. In our stores across Europe, customers can generally choose among payment in cash, with credit
or debit card or with gift cards and in Germany and Austria also with their Douglas Beauty Card Premium. In
addition, we also offer mobile payment services like Apple Pay and contactless payment as well as our digitized
Douglas Beauty Card Premium (also embedded in our mobile Douglas App) in Germany. Our e-commerce
platform offers a variety of payment methods such as invoicing, credit and debit cards, PayPal, advance
payment, online bank transfer pursuant to the electronic payment standard, direct debit, checks, the Douglas
Beauty Card Premium and gift cards. In addition, we have been introducing state-of-the-art digital payment
methods like iDeal on douglas.nl and P24 on douglas.pl. We offer these methods free of charge (other than
charging a small annual fee for the Douglas Beauty Card Premium, which has a payment function). We believe
that offering a wide array of payment methods according to local preferences enhances customer satisfaction
and improves our check-out conversion with respect to our e-commerce sales (that is, the rate of customers
who complete the check-out process after selecting products to buy from our websites). We also have tax free
options for Non-EU-residents shopping in the EU, such as Global Blue, China Union Pay, and JCB (for Japanese
residents) as well as Alipay, who can obtain a refund of VAT paid.

As we take on credit risk associated with certain payment methods, we have implemented risk
management systems to contribute to a reduction of the exposure to such risks, including fraud. For example,
in Germany, we are preparing to implement machine learning to further increase protection against financial
loss, with regards to our open invoice solution.

Brand Strategy, Marketing and Customer Relationship Management

_Brand Strategy_

As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY strategy, which puts e-commerce at the center of our business, we
have continued to make investments in e-commerce. We have modernized and rejuvenated the Douglas
brand, including a new, updated logo, more modern and premium positioning as well as new visual brand
language. Our brand strategy is centered around further increasing the appeal of our Douglas brand as a
preferred platform for our customers and suppliers across Europe. We believe that we distinguish ourselves
from competitors through our emotional, innovative and customer-centric approach as well as customerspecific marketing and offerings enabled by our data-driven customer relationship management tools. In
France and Monaco, we use the strong Nocibé brand. We currently concentrate our e-commerce activities
under the Douglas brand, Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty (and Nocibé in France and Monaco). The next step
in our strategy is the evolution of #FORWARDBEAUTY into #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst, which builds off
our updated brand presence and addresses changing customer behavior towards online retailing by
integrating our e-commerce capabilities with our brick & mortar stores, into one digitally driven beauty
platform.

###### 149

_Marketing_

Our marketing strategy is built on our strong Douglas / Nocibé brand and aims to attract and retain
consumers and suppliers to the Douglas beauty platform. Under the Douglas / Nocibé brand, our products
and services are marketed via multiple media channels, curated customer recommendations and promotions
(in store and online). In the financial year 2019/2020, our total gross marketing and advertising expenditure
amounted to €197.8 million, representing 6.1% of our sales. A significant portion of our marketing spend is
allocated to performance marketing.

Our marketing expenditures contain investments into the Douglas / Nocibé brand to further build
awareness and trust. We launch TV, print and digital performance campaigns which emphasize our positioning
as a modern brand that fosters diversity and inclusion, empowering everyone to live their own kind of beauty.
Those campaigns are extended via social media channels, where we also launch separate campaigns on topics
of interest for our consumers. We cover the most beauty-relevant channels, such as Facebook and Instagram
(with more than 6.4 million followers as of September 30, 2020 in our core countries), Google+, Pinterest and
YouTube with beauty tutorials, competitions and expert contributions. As of September 30, 2020, our average
daily social media reach was 8.0 million, including both paid and organic reach. We also offer our augmented
reality service, Beauty Mirror, and individual beauty tips. Most recently, and with promising results, we have
started our live shopping service Douglas LIVE, where our beauty advisors, influencers and brand testimonials
introduce products via livestream that can be immediately purchased by customers as well as a “ship-fromstore” delivery option.

The majority of our marketing material is produced centrally along an integrated marketing calendar,
which comprises the big seasonal campaigns (e.g. Christmas, Mother’s Day, Singles’ Day) and the
corresponding toolboxes for all channels (e.g. posters and displays for stores, newsletters, banners and stories
for e-commerce, as well as numerous still and moving assets for the social media channels). In addition, we also
create marketing for other seasonal occasions (Women’s Day, Day of the Kiss, etc.) including related
e-commerce stories. A significant portion of our marketing is used to promote supplier brands along all
customer touchpoints and we often offer our marketing services when contracting with new brands with limited
marketing experience or expertise. To support the evolving requirements from both our suppliers and
customers, we operate approximately 210 asset production days in a studio. For the financial year 2019/2020,
we had a marketing and advertising cost ratio of 6.1%.

We believe that our ability to reach millions of consumers daily along a significant variety of
touchpoints provides us with a competitive advantage that enables us to sell advertising space to our partners,
which in turn helps fund a significant portion of our own marketing expenditures.

_Customer Relationship Management_

Managing and maintaining the relationship that we have with our customers is an important part of our
business. In this regard, we view our customer service as an important part of our strategy, as it provides direct
feedback from our customer base and helps to interpret customers’ satisfaction with our products and service
and customers’ needs. A systematic customer lifecycle management with dedicated measures to win new
customers, activate, retain and develop existing customers, and, if necessary, re-activate and win back former
customers is at the heart of our customer relationship management strategy. Household penetration rates,
which we define as the number of customer cards per country in our core countries divided by the number of
households based on publicly available data in our core countries, increased to 31.4% in the financial year
2019/2020. Reachability, defined as how many customers are reachable at least via one communication
channel and have given us the permission to do so, increased by approximately 8% from the financial year
2018/2019 to the financial year 2019/2020.

An important tool in our customer lifecycle management is our customer loyalty card program, which
we believe is one of the largest in Europe with more than 44 million Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card
holders across Europe, including more than 35 million Douglas Beauty Card holders and more than 9 million
Nocibé Card holders in France and Monaco as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, we also
have approximately 2.6 million Douglas Beauty Card Premium members in Germany. As part of our loyalty card
program, we also promote the Douglas Beauty Card Premium, a premium card that requires an annual fee and
offers additional benefits such as invitations to exclusive events, pre-launches of new products and the
“Douglas magazine”, which has a total circulation of approximately 11 million copies in Germany.

As part of our updated #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we have adopted a data-centric
approach to our customer relationship management. Using customer behavioral data collected from online
purchases, usage of our Douglas Beauty Card / Nocibé Card and our marketing channels, our customer
relationship management analytics, driven by machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, allow us
to personalize all future customer interactions across all channels by clustering customers into segments and

###### 150


-----

providing them with tailored product recommendations, product news and other content. We believe that such
personalized curation drives customer loyalty and increases the frequency of customer interactions. Our
customer relationship management system assists us in getting to know our customers better, and to provide
them with personal recommendations, beauty content relevant to their preferences, and specific offers, which
in turn drives higher sales. In addition, we monetize our customer data by selling it to third parties who, for
example, use such data to optimize their products and for marketing performance campaigns. In the financial
year 2019/2020, our retail media sales amounted to approximately €2.9 million, and our data sales amounted
to approximately €5.4 million in the calendar year 2020.

In the financial year 2019/2020 in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty), the number
of purchases per year per customer was 3.0 for Douglas Beauty Card holders and 5.4 for Douglas Beauty Card
holders who used the Douglas App. Over the same period in Germany (excluding Parfumdreams and Niche
Beauty and including VAT), the average spend per customer was €52.1 for Douglas Beauty Card holders and
€53.4 for Douglas Beauty Card holders who used the Douglas App (compared to €50.8 for all customers in
Germany).

In addition, we believe that omnichannel customers have a higher order frequency and therefore
annual spend than customers who use only one channel. Among Douglas Beauty Card holders in Germany
(excluding Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty) in the financial year 2019/2020, the average spend per year at
€359 and number of purchases per year per customer at 6.7 for our omnichannel customers was twice as high
as compared to customers who shopped only online or in our brick & mortar stores.

_Customers_

Our business model focuses on consumers and we are therefore not exposed to any customer
concentration risk. Additionally, given the short payment terms of our sales, we have a low level of receivables
and bad debt expense.

Women have traditionally been, and continue to be, to a large extent the gender with the largest
spending for beauty and personal care products. In addition, women tend to be the decision makers in terms
of overall family health and beauty spending. Thus, we consider women as our most important customer
group. However, men are increasingly dedicating more time to, and spending more money on, their personal
appearance. As a result, men have also become an important target group of ours that we address through a
dedicated space in our store layout as well as special product offerings.

Based on our internal data for our Douglas Beauty Card holders, the average age of our German
customers is 43. Customers with a Douglas Beauty Card Premium, which requires an annual fee, are on
average 51 years old while our basic Douglas Beauty Card attracts younger customers with an average age of
36.

Our strong brand, broad and deep product offerings and focus on personalized and professional
customer service have created a very satisfied, loyal customer base, regarding both our brick & mortar as well
as our e-commerce business. Based on a consumer survey conducted by OC&C in 2019, we are seen as a top
choice for premium beauty products, both online and offline, across most of our core countries.

Operations: Suppliers and Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Information Technology

_Suppliers and Supply Chain Management_

_Suppliers_

We source our selective products from virtually all major national and international brands of beauty
products, with which we have established close and long-standing relationships, reflecting the interdependence of selective beauty suppliers and retailers like us. In Germany for example, our top five suppliers
of selective products accounted for less than 55% of our total purchasing volume in the financial year
2019/2020. None of our suppliers amounted to more than 20% of our total purchasing volume in the financial
year 2019/2020.

With respect to selective products, we enter into three different types of contracts with our suppliers,
namely selective distribution contracts, international framework and local supply trading agreements:

    - Firstly, we enter into often long-term selective distribution contracts (or authorized retail
agreements) with suppliers of selective beauty products, under which we are, on a
country-by-country basis, authorized by such suppliers to distribute products belonging to a
particular brand both in our stores and online provided that certain quality standards and other
criteria are met.

###### 151


-----

    - Secondly, we enter into yearly international framework trading agreements, in particular with our
top suppliers, which contain the basic commercial agreement between us and the relevant
supplier, setting forth the general terms of sale, in particular regarding invoice conditions, bonus
payment terms, promotional activities and marketing development allowances granted to us by
the supplier, general logistic conditions as well as the conditions for returning goods (e.g., of
products that become de-listed by the supplier).

    - Lastly, annual local trading agreements transpose the basic commercial agreement contained in
the international framework trading agreements for each country or specific countries (due to the
relevance of the individual market situation in each country, e.g., the different market position of
each brand within such market) and set forth the specific terms of sale, details of marketing efforts
and bonuses/discounts, merchandising (e.g., additional payments for a prominent placement of a
product in one or more stores) and other similar terms.

We aim to constantly improve our purchasing terms and to negotiate further specific price reductions
(such as, higher year-end discounts) by leveraging our bargaining power resulting from our international store
network and leading market shares in our core markets, which amounted to approximately 19% of the
consolidated premium beauty market in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland as of
September 30, 2020. We also aim to increase marketing-related investments (which are industry-typical,
so-called “market development funds”) from suppliers that support customer demand for their products, such
as the co-financing of promotions (including specific incentives or “challenges” to our sales force as well as
dedicated budgets for temporary promotional price reductions), co-advertising, in-store promotions, customer
mailings and product placements in the Douglas magazine.

With several of our top suppliers, we have negotiated international framework trading agreements in
order to secure consistent margins, standardize terms and conditions streamline and allow for an efficient
centralized contract management. We strive to expand this practice to other sourcing activities, including the
procurement of personal care products and accessories, with smaller suppliers.

In addition, we have implemented a suppliers’ code of conduct which has the objective of ensuring
compliance with relevant social and environmental standards.

_Supply Chain and Product Portfolio Management_

We manage our supply chain through an integrated information flow system, using the automated
demand forecast tool SAF by SAP in the majority of the countries where we operate, which enables us to
optimize merchandise inventories in our stores. We carefully manage our inventory with a strong focus on
identifying the most relevant brands for our discerning customers and maintaining an attractive overall
inventory “age” profile. Thereby, we follow an approach strictly driven by our defined key performance
indicators, tightly monitoring inventory turnover and out-of-stock products.

We have continuously increased our efforts relating to quality assurance and now operate a strict
quality management system, in particular focused on the processes relating to our own brand products (such
as the careful selection of suppliers of our own brand products, quality control of such products and handling
of non-conforming products and any claims brought with respect to such products). This is complemented by
quality assurance processes regarding selective and exclusive products offered by us (and, for exclusive
products, we generally also control the quality with samples prior to ordering the products).

As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we began in December 2020 to digitalize our
entire supply chain management with AI-powered forecasting software with machine learning algorithms that
we believe will enable us to increase product availability, improve inventory allocation and improve the impact
of our marketing campaigns. The new system is currently being implemented in Germany and we expect the
full transformation of our supply chain management to be complete in the next three years.

_Logistics_

We operate a logistics network across all of our major markets with over 20 operating logistic sites for
the financial year 2019/2020. The network comprises cross-docking centers, warehouses and e-commerce
fulfillment centers mostly operated by third parties.

In our cross-docking centers, incoming goods are processed and forwarded to our stores on a
“just-in-time” basis which allows high flexibility levels and quick adaptation to shifts in our supply chain (e.g.,
the flexibility to arrange for new contracts or to easily expand our store network). Products are constantly
restocked by our suppliers according to an aligned delivery schedule.

###### 152

In our warehouses, incoming goods are stored and available for pick & pack in order to fulfill every
replenishment order for our stores. In August 2018, we opened a new warehouse in Poland which is dedicated
to replenishing all Douglas branded products.

In our e-commerce fulfillment centers, like in our warehouses, incoming goods are stored and
available for pick & pack in order to fulfill every order for our online customers.

The following table provides an overview of our major logistics facilities (>1000m²):

As part of our #FORWARDBEAUTY.DigitalFirst strategy, we will transform our current logistics network
towards an OWAC approach. Each of the OWAC sites will fulfill orders for stores and online customers from a
common stock level per SKU as well as handle partner fulfillment for our marketplace partners. Each OWAC
site will carry up to 150,000 SKUs including marketplace SKUs. We intend to anchor our logistics operations
with five OWAC sites across Europe. We currently expect all OWAC sites to be owned, staffed, managed and
operated by several third-party service providers. In December 2020, the construction of the first OWAC site
started in Hamm, Germany which is expected to serve Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. We
expect to ship out the products of the first orders from Hamm in 2022.

_Information Technology_

Our scalable and integrated IT platform is designed and organized both to support our daily business
processes and financial management The strategic Group’s core platform consists of a SAP Retail, SAP
Logistics, SAP Finance and Controlling system, SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP Marketing Cloud, an omnichannel
point of sale (“POS”) solution by GK Software and a powerful BI platform based on snowflake database and
several front end tools such as Microstrategy, Tableau and Power BI. This environment provides our
management with all relevant information for forecasting and replenishment. For pricing, we are also
introducing AI based systems from Relex and Revionics, which aids in making automated and data driven
decisions.

The SAP Finance and Controlling system covers all countries. Of the core countries, Spain, France and
Italy use local IT solutions for various major business applications, such as for enterprise resource planning,
logistics and POS systems.

Our main software applications are hosted in various data centers. For three of our core countries
(Germany, the Netherlands, Poland) and some non-core countries, we maintain independent IT centers in
Germany which significantly mitigate the risks relating to a potential failure of our IT platforms. In Germany, the
core data center is located at our former headquarters in Hagen, and all relevant data is mirrored to a second
data center in Dortmund, Germany. Our French organization operates a core data center at Nocibé’s
headquarters in Villeneuve d’Ascq, France, and a back-up data center is operated by a third-party provider
located in France. In Spain, our two main data centers are located in Madrid and a third (back-up data center)
one is operated by a third party provider. In Italy, we operate a data center in Milan. Other non-core countries
operate on their own data centers, either with internal or external service provider solutions.

###### 153


-----

Our centrally managed new e-commerce platform (Germany, Austria, Poland and Switzerland) is
powered by SAP CommerceCloud, together with our own developed JavaScript front end, which is operated
by Douglas employees and supported by hosting resources under an outsourcing agreement with Microsoft
Azure in Amsterdam. Our French online shop is hosted under an outsourcing arrangement by a third party
based in Villeneuve d’Ascq, France. Countries on the former Hybris Commerce platform (Italy and The
Netherlands) are hosted under an outsourcing agreement by a third party provider (PlusServer GmbH) in
Cologne together with resources provided by Microsoft Azure. The Douglas Spain online shop is powered by a
self-developed front- and backend (php language), and runs in two data centers in Madrid. Smaller countries
such as Portugal, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia are operated by internal employees with
external resources, such as virtual machines, load balancers and Kubernetes clusters) provided by Microsoft
Azure. All remaining countries, such as Croatia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia are operated
within the respective local country organizations. Online shops belonging to Parfumdreams are operated and
hosted under an outsourcing agreement by a third party based in Klagenfurt, Austria. For risks relating to our IT
infrastructure, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and Business—Our operations may be
_interrupted or otherwise adversely affected as a result of failures in our information technology systems.” In_
recent years, we have experienced no significant downtime of our main IT systems.

We believe the effective utilization of our IT platforms and centralized big data solutions is integral to
our business, as these enable optimization and educated decision-making across our organization and
facilitates the interconnectedness of our business model across all channels, brick & mortar, online and mobile.
We maintain sophisticated tools for gathering large amounts of data generated through our customers’
browsing and shopping patterns in our online shops and on mobile applications. We then analyze this data
and optimize a large array of business functions, including anticipating our customers’ future shopping
preferences, optimizing payment options, stock allocation in our e-commerce and centers, and personalizing
our customers’ experience. Wherever possible, we try to calculate and analyze this data in real-time. We are
also able to market our data as a source of unique insight into customer behavior and preferences to our
partners, which we believe strengthens our relationship with suppliers.

Our IT infrastructure is supported by a team of internal IT experts predominately situated in Hagen,
Germany, and, to a limited extent, by external service providers.

Employees

We had an average number of employees of 21,016 (salaried employees and excluding apprentices)
in the financial year 2019/2020. We also use temporary workers to meet the demands of the business during
peak trading periods, in particular during the pre-Christmas and Christmas season. We employ part-time
employees at the holding level and the store level, whereby the share of part-time employees at the store level
is significantly higher.

The following tables show the average number of our employees (headcount) for the periods
indicated, broken down by functions:

In some jurisdictions, we are subject to national or regional collective bargaining agreements. While
none of our German Group companies are bound by collective bargaining agreements, a small number of
employment agreements include a reference clause with respect to collective bargaining agreements
applicable for the retail sector.

Within the Group, several forms of employee representation exist under which our employees are
represented by trade unions or other employee representative bodies.

Our sales staff compensation complies with the requirements stipulated under statutory minimum
wage regimes and collective agreements, with an incentive system in place at the store level based on certain
sales objectives.

We believe we are in compliance with applicable employment and labor laws. We value our close and
constructive relationships with trade unions, employee representatives and our employees in general and
pursue respectful and open communication with trade unions and relevant employee representatives at both
Group level and in each country, including in respect of our SOP and the corresponding measures.

###### 154

As part of the employment compensation package, we provide different retirement benefit
arrangements or similar benefits. For a description of pension schemes see “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Provisions for_
_Pensions”._

Real Estate and Leases

The vast majority of our sites, including nearly all our stores, are rented. Only a very small number of
the sites are owned by Group companies. In addition, certain sites are operated through service contracts.

Our stores (directly operated stores as well as franchised stores) are, with only very few exceptions,
operated on leased premises, and are governed by the respective legal regimes relating to commercial leases
in the different jurisdictions. Subject to the market practices of each jurisdiction, the duration of our lease
agreements is generally defined by a fixed term, during which the lease may generally not be terminated by
either party, in combination with either an extension option for us as lessee or a tacit renewal upon expiry of
the fixed term. In addition to the fixed lease payments (most commonly on a monthly basis), many of our lease
agreements contain sales-related additional variable lease payments, meaning that a portion of the lease
payments is tied to the level of net or gross revenue, as the case may be, generated in the store concerned,
subject to a minimum lease payment. The commercial leases that we sign with our landlords typically provide
for an adjustment of the rent as a function of changes in certain indices. We regularly review our lease
agreements and renegotiate their terms when possible.

As part of our SOP, which we believe creates additional leverage in our negotiations, we are also
targeting rent improvements and intend to actively re-negotiate leases with our landlords in respect of stores
that will remain open.

According to a recent analysis of our store network supported by external experts, we determined that
approximately two thirds of our rental contracts had break clauses, half of our “keep open” stores had a
lease-end or break option within the next 2 years and more than three quarters of our rent volume had
institutional landlords.

Intellectual Property

Our portfolio of registered intellectual property rights consists of trademarks and design rights.
Moreover, we possess several domain names. We typically grant franchisees a non-exclusive and
non-transferable license to use the “Douglas” (or “Nocibé”) trademarks and trade names as described in the
handbook to the franchise agreement, exclusively for the operation of a cosmetic and perfumery store located
at a concrete business address. In general, the franchisee may only use our trademarks, trade name or other
materials protected for our Group companies on websites, weblogs or similar online presences after
consultation and written approval by the franchisor.

_Trademarks and Design Rights_

We own a large portfolio of trademarks, including word trademarks and word/device trademarks used
by companies of our Group, and some design rights, which we typically register as European word and/or
word/design-trademarks internationally or locally in specific countries.

As of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 1,100 trademarks (including trademark applications)
globally. In particular, the trademarks that protect the designation “Douglas” as well as—for France (and
Monaco)—the trademark “Nocibé” are important to us.

Certain Douglas companies, in particular Parfümerie Douglas GmbH and Douglas Marken und
Lizenzen GmbH & Co. KG, entered into a number of co-existence agreements with third parties to settle
trademark disputes. Most of those co-existence agreements relate to “Douglas” trademarks owned by
Parfümerie Douglas GmbH and the new “DO/Douglas” brand icon applied for by Douglas Marken und
Lizenzen GmbH & Co. KG, which may only be used in the combination of “DO” and “Douglas”.

_Domain Names_

We own a large portfolio of approximately 1,300 domain names as of December 31, 2020. Several
companies of our Group have registered internet domains with the second level domain name “douglas” (as
opposed to “top level domain names”, which refer to the ending of the domain, such as “.de”, “.at”, etc.) as well
as many domain names which contain “douglas” as part of the domain name together with a generic term such
as “douglas-onlineshop”, “douglas-parfuem”, “parfumeriedouglas”, “meindouglas”, “mydouglas” or
“douglasbeauty”. In particular, “douglas.de”, and the other internet domains for the countries in which we
operate play an important role in our business operations. However, we do not own the domain name
“douglas.com”, which is used by a U.S. company operating in a different industry.

###### 155

Material Legal Disputes and Administrative Proceedings

Companies of our Group are involved in legal disputes and administrative proceedings as part of their
ordinary business activities and this will likely continue to be the case in the future. It is impossible to determine
or predict the outcome of cases pending or threatened. Legal disputes and administrative proceedings in
which our Group companies have been involved during the past twelve months, or which are currently
pending or threatened, mainly relate to employment matters, intellectual property, advertising or distribution
practices, leases, and the adequacy of the squeeze-out compensation to be paid to former minority
shareholders. The Company believes that other than the proceedings described in the section “Risk Factors—
_We are or may become involved in litigation and administrative or arbitration proceedings, which may adversely_
_affect our financial position”, during a period covering the previous twelve months, no governmental, legal or_
arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Company is
aware) may have or have had in the recent past significant effects on the Company’s and our financial position
or profitability.

Insurance

We have taken out comprehensive insurance policies in relation to risks associated with our business
activities, such as policies covering our general liability, product and environmental liability, insurance of
property and merchandise (including product transportation and warehouse insurance), cyber/IT/electronic
equipment as well as insurance covering business interruptions. Under these policies (and related underlying
policies), insured losses include those resulting from natural and human risks such as business interruptions,
product defects and events relating to the manipulation of products and losses relating to the handling of
money, among others. In addition, we have policies for D&O (directors & officers) liability, cyber risks and
fidelity insurance, which are applicable for the Company and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, we have taken out
certain additional insurance policies for our subsidiaries in certain countries (including, among others,
Germany). Our insurance coverage is subject to the usual exclusions, limits and deductibles. At the same time,
we have identified several risks that cannot be insured on economically feasible terms and for which, therefore,
we have chosen not to purchase insurance coverage. These risks include, for example, business interruptions
caused by acts of terror and epidemics.

The management team believes that we have adequate insurance coverage against all material risks
that are typically insured by similar companies with comparable risk exposure. Insurance coverage is regularly
verified and adjusted when necessary.

Regulatory Environment

The retail sector in which we operate, apart from regulations relating to the selective distribution
system as further described below under “—Regulation on Selective Distribution Systems”, is not a regulated
sector and thus, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the respective jurisdictions in which we operate
that are generally applicable to any company doing business in such jurisdictions. These include, in particular,
requirements with respect to product liability and consumer protection. EU regulations apply directly in all
member states of the European Union (the “EU Member States”). As a result, our business is subject to these
rules in all EU Member States. In contrast, EU directives, while binding EU Member States as to the result to be
achieved, need to be implemented into national law. Hence, regarding those standards contained in EU
directives that are applicable to our business, national implementing rules can differ slightly from one EU
Member State to another. To the extent governed by EU regulations or national laws that are based on EU
directives, the regulatory environment in most other EU Member States and the member states of the EEA
should be similar to the regulatory framework in Germany. The regulatory requirements applicable to our
business activities are subject to change, as they are continuously adapted at the national, European and
international level. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil liability,
administrative orders, fines, or even criminal sanctions.

Most of the products which we market are cosmetics, which are primarily subject to the EU Cosmetics
Regulation (see below). However, depending on the specific characteristics of our products, a large range of
other regulatory requirements may also apply to both us and our products, which govern the manufacturing,
transporting, storing and selling of these products. For example, one of our suppliers recently informed us that
some of their products contain substances that fall within the scope of EU Regulation 2019/1148 on the use of
raw materials for explosives, which came into effect on 1 February 2021. This regulation aims to prevent the
misuse of substances or mixtures which could be used to manufacture explosives. While the sale of such
substances is not generally prohibited, we nevertheless need to comply with certain monitoring and reporting
obligations and need to ensure that our employees are properly trained in this regard. Our products also
typically contain chemicals and as such we are required to comply with EC Regulation 1907/2006 on the
registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals. For example, as so-called downstream users
we are required to provide our customers with information on the safe use of the products, which we often

###### 156


-----

need to obtain from the actual supplier first. To the extent we act as importers of such products to the
European Union, further obligations may apply, such as registering substances the import of which exceeds
certain thresholds. EC Regulation 1272/2008 regarding the classification, labelling and packaging of
substances and mixtures further imposes certain labelling and packaging requirements (including hazard
labels and warnings) depending on the individual characteristics of our products not just on our suppliers put
also on us. Some of our products also qualify as medical devices or food and are therefore subject to medical
device or food regulations (see below). Depending on market trends these products (but also others, such as
textiles) may in the future contribute in a larger extent to our revenues as they currently do. We generally aim to
comply with all of these regulations and any other regulation that applies to us and our products. However, we
cannot guarantee that we do so at all times and failure to do so may lead to adverse agency action such as
investigations, fines, product recalls or (temporary) restrictions on sales of certain products.

The following provides a brief overview of selected regulations that are applicable to our business
operations.

_Foreign Trade and Customs Law_

We source most of our products from member states of the European Union, but some of our
suppliers are located outside of the European Union, e.g. in Asia or the United States of America.

Within the European internal market, the principle of free movement of goods applies. With respect to
import and export of goods from countries that are not Member States of the EU, we must comply with national
and European foreign trade and customs regulations. At EU level, the relevant regulatory framework is set out
in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. of October 9, 2013 laying
down the Union Customs Code (“UCC”) which replaced the Community Customs Code (“CCC”) established in
1992. This Regulation entered into force on October 30, 2013 and its substantive provisions became
applicable as of May 1, 2016. The UCC shall, among other, simplify customs rules and procedures and facilitate
more efficient customs transactions in line with modern-day needs, completing the shift by customs authorities
to a paperless and fully electronic environment.

Whereas imports and exports within the EEA are in principle not liable to customs duty, the movement
of goods beyond the frontiers of the EEA is subject to customs control between the customs union of the EU
and EEA member states which are not EU Member States. The customs control charges, among other things,
statutory import duties. Customs offices may from time to time initiate customs inspections to assess whether
customs regulations have been infringed. In addition, the import of certain groups of products or from certain
countries may require an import permit.

Following the withdrawal from the European Union and the end of the transition period on
December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom, with the exception of Northern Ireland, has left the EU Single Market
and the Customs Union. In this regard, neither the principle of free movement of goods nor the UCC are
applicable from January 1, 2021 onwards in trade with the UK. With regard to trade with the UK, the EU-UK
Trade and Cooperation Agreement was concluded on 24 December 2020, which is provisionally in force
(pending ratification by the EU Parliament) and which ensures quota- and tariff-free trade. However, customs
formalities such as for instance the submission of entry or exit summary declarations must still be observed.
Furthermore, in order to achieve tariff- and quota-free trade, a statement of origin of goods from a contracting
state must be provided

_Consumer Protection Law_

We must further comply with various consumer protection regulations with respect to the marketing
and sale of products to customers, including our online selling activities.

Throughout the EU, consumer protection is extensively regulated in particular on the basis of the
following EU directives:

    - the Council Directive 93/13/EEC of April 5, 1993, amended by Directive 2011/83/EU of the
European Parliament and the Council of October 25, 2011 on unfair terms in consumer contracts;

    - the Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 25, 1999,
amended by Directive 2011/83 EU of the European Parliament and the Council of October 25,
2011, on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees;

    - the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000 on
certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the
internal market (Directive on electronic commerce);

###### 157


-----

    - the Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 12, 2002, last
amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
November 25, 2009, concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in
the electronic communications sector (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications);

    - the Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 11, 2005
concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (Unfair
Commercial Practices Directive), which prohibits, among others, certain particularly aggressive or
misleading commercial practices or advertising;

    - the Directive 2006/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2006
concerning misleading and comparative advertising;

    - the Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2011 on
consumer rights (Directive on Consumer Rights);

    - the Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of May 21, 2013 on
alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No
2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Directive on consumer ADR); and

    - the Directive 2019/2161/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of November 27, 2019 as
regards to the better enforcement and modernization of Union consumer protection rules (to be
transposed into national law prior to November 28, 2021).

The aforementioned EU directives on consumer protection and the national laws which implement or
complement these directives impose extensive duties and responsibilities on retailers such as Douglas,
including the following:

With respect to our online activities, online purchases constitute “distance contracts” that are subject
to specific consumer protection. Pursuant to the Directive on Consumer Rights, effective as from June 13, 2014
(last amended by Directive (EU) 2015/2302 of November 25, 2015) consumers have the statutory right
(EU-wide) to withdraw from a distance contract within 14 days after receipt of goods (or within a period of
twelve months and 14 days after receipt of goods if the consumer has not been properly informed about its
statutory right of withdrawal). Withdrawal must be exercised by distinct declaration towards the seller (e.g., in
writing, per e-mail or phone). The return of the goods without further comment does not constitute a valid
declaration of withdrawal any longer. If the statutory right of withdrawal is exercised, within 14 days from the
day of the withdrawal, the customer must return the goods and the seller must reimburse the purchase price
within 14 days of receiving the note of withdrawal. The consumer only bears the direct cost of returning the
goods, unless otherwise agreed upon or if the seller failed to inform that the consumer has to bear it. The
customer also has to compensate the seller for any loss in value of the returned goods, if such loss is due to the
customer handling the goods in a way that was not required to examine the condition, features and
functionalities of the goods and the seller has informed the customer about its statutory right of withdrawal.

In addition, online retailers must comply with extensive and formalized information requirements.
They have to provide their (potential) customers with detailed and accurate information, inter alia, on the
offered goods, on the way a binding contract can be concluded, on price and payment details, on their return
policy, on the statutory right to withdraw from a contract (irrespective of any more beneficial return policy that
may be afforded by the online retailers, on their general terms of sale and on statutory warranties). EU
directives and national laws set out detailed criteria on when, where and by which means this information has
to be provided. Online retailers have to implement these requirements in the design and structure of their
online shops, mobile-commerce platforms and apps, in their ordering and payment processes and in their
delivery systems. Due to changes in legislation, online retailers have to adapt their shop design on an ongoing
basis. For example, as a result of the Directive on Consumer Rights, online retailers were obliged to implement
a “button solution” pursuant to which a binding purchase can only be completed by clicking on a button that is
explicitly labeled “order with obligation to pay” (or similar). Directly before the consumer makes the purchase,
he or she is to be informed by a summary of certain key information relating to the purchase, Art. 8(2) of the
Directive on Consumer Rights. Failure to comply with these information requirements may give rise to civil
liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief) or fines and may in some cases result in an extension
of warranty periods or even in the invalidity of the affected customer contracts. The concrete consequences
and penalties for infringing national laws implementing the Consumer Directive are laid down by each Member
State.

Advertising, including promotional games, newsletters and personalized product recommendations,
is heavily regulated, in particular if distributed through e-mail. An advertisement must not be misleading,
constitute an unreasonable nuisance or make use of harassment, coercion or undue influence. These criteria
leave wide room for interpretation and the assessment of courts and other competent bodies is often hard to
foresee.

###### 158


-----

The Directive (EU) 2019/2161modernises almost all EU consumer legislation. Member States have
time until the end of November 2021 to adopt and publish implementing legislation and will have to apply it by
28 May 2022. The Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) will also undergo far-reaching changes. New
information requirements are to be introduced, for example, the online retailer might be obliged to indicate
that a price was personalized on the basis of automated decision-making. Furthermore, additional information
requirements may apply, e.g. regarding available means of communication.

_Data Protection Law_

As retailers generally process customer personal data for several purposes, including for the
performance of the contract and marketing purposes, compliance with data protection laws must be ensured.
The collection, processing and use of personal data is extensively regulated by both European and national
legislation. At EU level, data protection law is primarily governed by the GDPR, which began to apply from
25 May 2018 and introduced significant changes to EU and local data protection regimes. In particular, the
GDPR contains much higher potential fines for breaches, new obligations for data processors and data
controllers, increased accountability, expanded rights for data subjects and an extended territorial scope.

Since the GDPR came into force, there has been increased enforcement of the strict regulations by the
respective national supervisory authorities. For example, the GDPR provides for a detailed regulatory system
regarding contracts relating to commissioned data processing or joint controllership which has to be
implemented in particular in the context of IT outsourcings.

In general, data privacy laws regulate when and how personal data may be collected, for which
purposes they may be processed and/or used, for how long they may be stored and to whom and how they
may be transferred. The transfer of personal data to recipients outside the EEA is subject to specific
requirements. Furthermore, the GDPR or national data privacy laws require organizational measures such as
the appointment of a data protection officer, set forth the rights of data subjects (i.e., the persons to whom the
personal data relates) (e.g., information rights) and determine the sanctions for infringements. Apart from that,
the GDPR inter alia requires the implementation of appropriate technical and organization measures to ensure
the data security in general.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a new e-privacy regulation which will replace the
ePrivacy Directive, as well as the Cookie Directive, is still pending at the EU level, and it is uncertain as to when
this regulation may enter into force and when it may become enforceable. Furthermore, based on its data
strategy, the EU plans to comprehensively revise the legal framework for handling data, for example through
the proposed Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. Additionally, the European Court of Justice
(Fashion ID, C-40/17 and Planet 49, C-673/17) specified in 2018 and 2019 certain rules for the use of internet
tracking technologies and cookies. The European Court of Justice (Schrems II, C-311/18) has also issued
another important judgment on European Data Protection laws, stating that the transfer of personal data into
the United States of America (U.S.) cannot be based on the EU/US Privacy Shield instrument. This ruling covers
not only data transfers to the U.S. but also to any other third country within the meaning of the GDPR that does
not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the EU and that has not been recognised by an adequacy
decision of the EU Commission. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the concrete data protection
consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (“Brexit”) remain unclear.

_Regulations on Shop Closing Time and Working Time_

Most European countries have regulations on shop closing times, which particularly apply to shop
closing times on weekends and holidays. Regulations on shop closing times during night hours on working
days were suspended by several European countries as respective regulations were not required anymore
after the implementation of Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organization of working
time.

_Regulations on Minimum Wage_

Even though employer and employee are generally free to agree on employment conditions by
mutual agreement in their employment contract, certain minimum working conditions must be observed. For
example, in all 27 member states of the European Union minimum wages may apply either under statutory laws
or collective bargaining arrangements with rather widely varying levels of the minimum wage from country to
country. Since there is, currently, no harmonized legislation of the European Union, the further details of the
minimum wage regime vary from country to country. While there is, however, a proposal from the European
Commission for a EU-wide statutory minimum wage framework, the respective legislative procedures are still in
an early stage.

_EU Payment Services Directive_

The Payment Service Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (“Payment Service Directive 2”) regulates payment
services and payment service providers throughout the EU. The Payment Service Directive 2 aims to, amongst
other objectives, better protect consumers when they pay online. This is reflected in the new requirement that
when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction, a strong customer authentication needs to take place.
Such strong customer authentication is defined as an authentication process that validates the identity of the
user of a payment service or of the payment transaction and indicates whether the use of a payment instrument
is authorized.

In addition, the Payment Service Directive 2 provides for specific rules on payment instruments such as
gift cards. These rules have been narrowed down compared to the preceding Payment Service Directive 1
(Payment Service Directive 2007/64/EC). Gift cards and similar ‘limited network’ schemes need to be registered
with the competent authorities, if the total value of payment transactions executed over the preceding 12
months exceeds the amount of EUR 1 million. National implementations of the Payment Service Directive 2 and
the application of these rules by the national regulatory authorities may vary from country to country.

_Regulation on Selective Distribution Systems_

The selective distribution system, as implemented by the suppliers of our Group, is subject to
European and German competition law. In this respect, the following principles apply:

TFEU prohibits agreements which have an anticompetitive object or restrictive effects on competition,
unless such agreements fall under so-called block exemptions or individual exemptions pursuant to Art. 101
(3) TFEU. Contractual clauses violating European competition law are void which may also affect the remainder
of the respective agreements. Furthermore, in such instances the competent competition authorities may
initiate proceedings against the contractual parties and substantial fines can be imposed.

According to the relevant case law, Art. 101 (1) TFEU does not apply if selective distribution systems
are based on purely qualitative criteria, provided that: (i) the nature of the product requires a selective
distribution system in order to ensure the high quality of service around the respective product and its proper
use; (ii) the authorization of distributors is only based on objective and non-discriminatory qualitative criteria
which are applied consistently and (iii) such criteria do not exceed what is necessary to ensure the quality of
service around the respective product and its proper use.

Irrespective of whether these criteria are met, in particular if additional quantitative criteria are
included in the selective distribution system, the relevant agreements may nonetheless benefit from an
exemption under EU Regulation No. 330/2010 (Vertical Block Exemption Regulation). Such exemption
requires, among other things, that the market share of both the supplier and the authorized distributor does
not exceed 30% and respective agreements do not contain so-called “hard core” restrictions of competition. In
the context of selective distribution systems, resale price maintenance, restrictions of active or passive sales to
end consumers as well as restrictions of cross-supplies between authorized distributors constitute such “hard
core” restrictions.

The abovementioned principles also apply to online selective distribution with a per se prohibition of
e-commerce sales or criteria for e-commerce sales which are not overall equivalent to the criteria imposed for
the sales from brick & mortar shops and are not necessary to ensure a certain quality of distribution. Such
clauses may constitute hard-core restrictions and will also very often not qualify for an exemption under Art.
101 (3) TFEU. Furthermore, there are ongoing discussions, involving competition authorities, whether a
prohibition of sales on open online platforms (such as eBay) is in line with competition law or whether such a
prohibition may raise anticompetitive concerns.

EU Regulation No. 330/2010 is scheduled to expire in May 2022 and a review of the regulation at the
level of the European Commission is ongoing. With regard to this regulation, but also generally, it cannot be
excluded that following changes in the applicable statutes, regulations, or developments of the case law or
decision-making practice of the relevant competition authorities, other channels of sale may begin selling
products (or increasingly sell products) that currently generate the majority of our sales and this may lead to a
significant increase in competition (see also “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks—We may be
_adversely affected by changes antitrust and competition laws and regulations, in particular with respect to_
_selective distribution contracts.”)._

_Cosmetics Regulation_

On November 30, 2009, Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(the “Cosmetic Products Regulation”) was adopted, which is the main regulatory framework for finished

###### 160


-----

cosmetic products as defined therein when placed on the EU market. In addition to the Cosmetic Products
Regulation, other EU and/or national legislation may apply for certain aspects of the regulation of cosmetic
products (e.g. cosmetic products including cannabidiol or cannabis as ingredients must comply with narcotics
laws). The Cosmetic Products Regulation provides an internationally recognized regime, which reinforces the
safety of cosmetic products taking into consideration the latest technological developments, including the
possible use of nanomaterial.

The main purpose of the Cosmetic Products Regulation is to ensure that only safe cosmetic products
are placed on the EU market. This requires in particular that cosmetic products are manufactured in
accordance with good manufacturing practice. Further, the Cosmetic Products Regulation prohibits or restricts
the use of a wide range of substances in cosmetic products. With respect to the use of colorants, preservatives
and UV-filters, including those that are nanomaterials, these can only be used if explicitly allowed by the
Cosmetic Products Regulation. Products containing other nanomaterials not otherwise restricted by the
Cosmetic Products Regulation may be the object of a full safety assessment at EU level, if the EU Commission
has concerns. Nanomaterials must be labeled in the list of ingredients with the word “nano” in brackets
following the name of the substance.

Furthermore, only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the EU as
“responsible person” may be placed on the market. As a general rule, the responsible person must be
established within the EU and is either the manufacturer or importer or a person or entity designated by those.
A distributor may be the responsible person where he places a cosmetic product on the market under his
name or trademark (as we do for our private label products) or modifies a product already placed on the
market in such a way that compliance with the applicable requirements may be affected. The Cosmetic
Products Regulation includes rules to allow for the precise identification of who the responsible person is with
regard to a certain product, and clearly outlines the obligations of such responsible person. Responsible
persons have, inter alia, an obligation to notify serious undesirable effects to competent national authorities.
Further, responsible persons must ensure that a cosmetic product has undergone a safety assessment and that
a product safety report has been set up for the product before it is placed on the market. The Cosmetic
Products Regulation also imposes documentation obligations on the responsible person. As for our own brand
products, certain subsidiaries of our Group act as responsible person for purposes of the Cosmetic Products
Regulation.

For products we only distribute but for which are not the responsible person, the Cosmetic Products
Regulation also imposes obligations, although these are less restrictive. For example, before making a
cosmetic product available on the market, distributors shall verify that specific labelling information is present,
specific language requirements are fulfilled, and the date of minimum durability specified has not passed.
Additionally, they shall not market the products if they have reason to believe that they are not in conformity
with the Regulation and if they have done so already, they have to take appropriate field safety corrective
measures.

Furthermore, the Cosmetic Products Regulation introduces a centralized notification process for all
cosmetic products placed on the EU market, so that responsible persons will need to notify their products. The
Cosmetic Products Regulation also includes rules banning animal testing and comprehensive labeling
requirements.

We review our own brand products, which are manufactured by third-party suppliers and which we
then sell under our own brands, for compliance with the applicable regulations of the Cosmetic Products
Regulation. For further information on the risks associated with our own brand products, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Market Environment and Business—We are subject to risks in connection with the quality_
_and timely delivery of our own brand products and our relationship with the manufacturers of such products”._
Where we act as a distributor, we comply with the obligations applicable to distributors under the Cosmetic
Products Regulation.

_Food Law_

Operators of food businesses, including producers, processors, importers, and distributors who place
food products on the market in the European Union, are obliged to ensure that the requirements of food law
are met within the food business under their control, especially with regard to the safety of such products.
Overall, EU food law consists of a very wide range of regulatory requirements, both general and specific. The
following provides an overview of some food related regulations potentially relevant, but it does not provide
an exhaustive summary.

Among other regulations, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of January 28, 2002, as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/1243 of June 20, 2019, provides
general principles and requirements of food law, inter alia, with regard to food safety. Regulation (EC) No

###### 161


-----

178/2002 established the European Food Safety Authority, stipulates procedures and requirements in matters
of food safety, and the measures to be taken in order to avoid threats to food safety, such as by withdrawing
and/or recalling unsafe products from the market. As a major part of food safety, food business operators have
to ensure compliance with food hygiene regulations, such as Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of April 29, 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, as last amended by Regulation
(EC) No 219/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 11, 2009, which requires food
business operators to maintain a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) concept.

Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 10, 2002 on the
approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements, as last amended by Commission
Regulation (EU) 2017/1203 of July 5, 2017, provides harmonized rules on food supplements. For this purpose,
it lays down, for example, a harmonized list of vitamins and minerals that may be added for nutritional
purposes in food supplements. According to the Directive, Member States may, for monitoring purposes,
request notification to their competent authority of the placing on the market in their territory of a food
supplement product.

Furthermore, according to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of October 25, 2011, as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of November 25, 2015, with regards to the provision of food information to consumers, the food
business operator responsible for the food information i.e. the operator established in the EU under whose
(business) name the food is marketed, otherwise, the importer into the Union market must ensure that all
mandatory information on food is provided, and that any other information is clear and not misleading.
Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 20, 2006 on
nutrition and health claims made on foods, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1047/2012 of
8 November 2012, further provides that nutrition and health claims made in commercial communications,
whether in the labelling, presentation or advertising of foods to be delivered as such to the final consumer,
shall only be used if they are authorized and included in respected lists of authorized claims.

We review our “#INNERBEAUTY” food supplements which are manufactured by third-party suppliers
and which we then sell under our own brands for compliance with the applicable food laws.

_Medical Device Law_

Medical devices are products or equipment intended generally for a medical use. In the European
Union, most medical devices may only be placed on the market if a CE marking is duly attached. To attach a CE
marking to a product, the product must fulfil the essential requirements provided for in one of the three
directives (“Medical Device Directives”), i.e. Directive 90/385/EEC regarding active implantable medical
devices (AIMD); Directive 93/42/EEC regarding medical devices (MDD); or Directive 98/79/EC regarding in
vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDD).

At present, a material change of the legal framework of producing and marketing medical devices is
ongoing in the EU. On May 25, 2017, the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of April 5, 2017 on medical devices (“Medical Device Regulation” or “MDR”) entered into force (for in
vitro diagnostics, Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of 5 April 2017). The MDR will replace the Medical Device
Directives governing the production and marketing of medical devices. The requirements that legal
manufacturers of medical devices must observe will be further strengthened.

Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices and distributors will have a transition time until
May 26, 2021 (the date of general application) to meet the requirements of the MDR. As we only act as a
distributor of medical devices, less restrictive rules apply to us as compared to manufacturers of medical
devices. However, the MDR provides for additional duties that we, as distributor, need to comply with as of
May 26, 2021. For example, distributors must verify that the device has been CE marked, and that the EU
declaration of conformity of the device has been drawn up and that the device is accompanied by the
information to be supplied by the manufacturer in accordance with the MDR.

_Regulations Regarding Product Safety and Product Liability_

Producers and distributors who place products on the market in the European Union must ensure that
the products are safe. Among other regulations, for products intended for consumers or likely to be used by
consumers, this is regulated in Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 3, 2001, as last amended by EC Regulation 596/2009 of June 18, 2009, on general product safety
(the “EU Directive on Product Safety”). Where products are subject to specific safety requirements imposed by
EU legislation (e.g. cosmetics, food products, or medical devices), the EU Directive on Product Safety only
applies to the aspects and risks or categories of risks not covered by those requirements. The EU Directive on

###### 162


-----

Product Safety provides that producers may only put products on the market when these products comply with
the general safety requirement. In addition, producers must provide consumers with the necessary information
so that consumers are able to assess a product’s inherent threat, particularly when this is not directly obvious.
Furthermore, producers must adopt the necessary measures to avoid such threats, for example, by
withdrawing unsafe products from the market, informing customers and recalling products that have already
been supplied to customers. In this context, it is relevant to note that under the EU Directive on Product Safety—
as well as pursuant to most other European and/or national legislation on product safety—any entity presenting
itself as the manufacturer by affixing its name, trademark or other distinctive mark to a product qualifies as
producer and must comply with the above-mentioned obligations. As we sell products manufactured by third
parties under our own brands, we qualify as a producer. For certain products, additional requirements may
apply; for example, the labelling of certain clothes is regulated in the EU by the Textile Regulation (EU) No
1007/2011 on fiber names and related labelling and marking of the fiber composition of textile products.

Pursuant to the EU Directive on Product Safety, distributors must help to ensure that the products they
supply comply with the general safety requirements, monitor the safety of products on the market and provide
the necessary documents ensuring that the products can be traced. If the producers or the distributors
discover that a product is dangerous, they must notify the competent authorities and, if necessary, cooperate
with them. As a Directive, the Member States had to implement it into national law.

In addition, because we sell our own brand products (manufactured by third parties) under our own
brands and import certain products from outside the EU, we qualify as producer of certain cosmetic and other
products and are thus subject to applicable legislation on product liability. For example, all Member States of
the European Union were required to implement EU Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985, as amended by
Directive 1999/34/EC of May 10, 1999, on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative
provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (“Product Liability Directive”), which
applies to all movables marketed in the EEA (with very few exceptions). The Product Liability Directive
establishes the principle of strict liability, i.e., liability without fault of the producer, in cases of damage caused
by a defective product. It covers death, personal injuries and damages of at least €500 to an item of property
(other than the defective product itself) caused by defective products intended for private use or consumption
and used by the injured person mainly for that purpose. The Product Liability Directive does not stipulate any
financial ceiling on the producer’s liability but allows the Member States to limit a producer’s liability for
damage from a death or personal injury and caused by identical items with the same defect to an amount of at
least €70.0 million. In addition, the Product Liability Directive does not prevent the legal systems of the Member
States from granting additional or more extensive rights to injured parties based on grounds of contractual
liability or on grounds of non-contractual liability.

_Environmental laws_

Environmental laws may be applicable for the disposal of cosmetics and may contain provisions
regulating the special treatment of cosmetic disposal. The same applies to the packaging of cosmetic and
other products. For instance, the EU Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 20, 1994, last amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852 of May 30, 2018, on packaging and packaging
waste (the “EU Packaging Directive”) (as implemented in the individual EU countries) must be complied with.
The EU Packaging Directive provides, amongst others, for an obligation to participate in a return, collection
and recovery scheme with respect to packaging.

In addition, the Directive 2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on
waste electrical and electronic equipment, last amended by Directive (EU) 2018/849 of May 30, 2018 (the
“WEEE-Directive”), may be applicable. The WEEE-Directive imposes responsibility for the disposal of waste
electrical and electronic equipment on the producers or distributors of such equipment. In this context, the
WEEE-Directive provides, inter alia, for an obligation of all producers of electrical and electronic equipment or
their authorized representatives to register with the national registers of producers in all EU countries where
they sell electrical and electronic equipment.

The EU Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 19, 2008,
last amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851 of May 30, 2018, aims, amongst others, at preventing and reducing
the generation of waste and improving the efficiency of resource use. This Directive entails general
requirements in the context of waste prevention, recovery and disposal, such as, for example, enhanced
product responsibility according to which products should be designed in a way which reduces their
environmental impact and the generation of waste in the course of their production and subsequent use.

Regarding aerosol dispensers, such as deodorant sprays, Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of September 16, 2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer,
last amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/605 of March 29, 2017 (Ozone Regulation) may also be relevant.
According to the Ozone Regulation, products that contain controlled substances listed in Annex I of the Ozone
Regulation may, as a rule, not be placed on the market and/or imported.

_French Law on payment terms_

In France, we must comply with Article L. 441-10 of the French Commercial code (code de commerce).
This provision contains two rules applying to payment terms. According to the first rule, if the parties do not
agree on specific payment terms (e.g., through a specific provision included in the seller’s general sales terms
or the purchaser’s general purchasing terms), this term is automatically 30 days after the receipt of the goods
or of the provision of the services. According to the second rule, the parties may not agree on payment terms
exceeding 45 days from the end of the month (i.e., 45 days starting from the end of the month during which the
invoice is issued or alternatively the end of the month during which a delay of 45 days from the date of issuance
of the invoice expires) or 60 calendar days from the issuance of the invoice. In case of negotiated payment
terms, the payment term must be expressly mentioned in the contract and cannot provide a grossly unfair
disadvantage to the creditor. If the seller establishes general sales terms, these must provide for a number of
provisions, including late payment terms and the amount of the indemnity due to the seller in the event of late
payment from the purchaser (set by decree, currently at €40).

###### CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with companies
within our Group. These agreements mainly relate to the supply of IT and accounting services and the
rendering of other intra-group services, such as business advisory, treasury and finance, marketing, human
resources, legal and tax.

Management Participation Program

In 2015, subsequent to our acquisition by the CVC Funds, a management equity participation
program (the “MEP 1”) was established via a management participation pooling vehicle above LuxCo 3. In
2020, a second management equity participation program (the “MEP 2” and together with the MEP 1, the
“MEP”) was initiated via MEP 2 KG, a management participation pooling vehicle above TopCo in order to
further incentivize the management team. The subscribing employees and members of senior management
entered into an investment agreement governing their rights and obligations in connection with their
investments. The investment agreement contains customary provisions, including the opportunity to invest
indirectly in the Group and in the event of the current majority shareholder departing, to share in any increase
in value through their own investment.

Profit and Loss Transfer Agreements

In 2015, TopCo as parent entity entered into a profit and loss transfer agreement with the Parent as
subsidiary and the Parent as parent entity entered into a profit and loss transfer agreement with the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer as subsidiary. As a result of these profit and loss transfer agreements (the “PLTAs”),
TopCo became the head of the tax group for German corporate income tax (“CIT”) and trade tax (“TT”)
purposes for our Group. Pursuant to the PLTAs, the subsidiary must generally transfer its entire profits to the
parent entity which in turn must compensate the subsidiary for any of the subsidiary’s losses.

Therefore, while the historical financial information included and presented in this offering
memorandum is that of the Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, due to the PLTAs, CIT and TT accrue at the
level of TopCo rather than at the level of the Parent or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, respectively, in each
case assuming that the tax group is recognized by the competent tax authorities. Further, the tax group allows
for a consolidation of taxable profits and losses of entities within the tax group. Finally, both profit transfers and
loss compensations are (in principle) tax neutral transactions for CIT and TT purposes.

Immediately after the Issue Date, it is the current intention to merge the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
into the Parent and subsequently to merge the surviving entity into TopCo (the “Post-Closing Mergers”). As a
result of the Post-Closing Mergers, the PLTAs would terminate and all intercompany liabilities between TopCo,
the Parent and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would cease to exist by operation of law.

Other arrangements with related parties

We have commercial relationships with certain minority shareholders of our subsidiaries, including
related to the leasing of property or the supply of products from such parties or companies in which they have
an interest. In addition, we directly and indirectly rent four of our brick & mortar stores in Germany from Kreke
Immobilien KG, Hagen, Germany, a company in which Dr. Henning Kreke, a member of the board of directors
of LuxCo2 and a member of the Founder Co-Investors, indirectly holds an interest. In addition, Dr. Henning
Kreke had a consulting agreement with the Group, which was terminated by mutual agreement with effect as of
the end of February 2021. In total, we incurred expenses of €5.8 million, €7.3 million and €6.3 million from our
above described relationships in the financial years 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020.

###### PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

CVC Funds and certain investors or limited partners in the CVC Funds indirectly (through wholly
owned intermediate holding companies) own approximately 84.2% (before management participation) of the
entire share capital of TopCo and the Founder Co-Investors directly (through wholly-owned intermediate
holding companies) own approximately 15.8% (before management participation) of the entire share capital of
TopCo. Certain employees and members of the management have also invested in management participation
programs established in MEP KG and MEP 2 KG and have beneficial ownership, and directly or indirectly, of
the share capital of TopCo. See “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure” and “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions— Management Participation Program” for more information._

_The following summary of certain provisions of our indebtedness does not purport to be complete and_
_is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

Senior Secured Facilities Agreement

_Overview and Structure_

In connection with the Transaction, Douglas GmbH (the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) will, on or prior
to the Issue Date, enter into the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement with, among others, TopCo as the
company and an original guarantor, certain of TopCo’s restricted subsidiaries, including the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, as original borrowers and original guarantors (as applicable), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch
as agent, the Security Agent as security agent and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, Deutsche Bank AG,
UniCredit Bank AG, UBS Europe SE and BNP Paribas SA as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners (who, or
affiliates of whom, will also be lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement). The Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement will provide for the following:

    - a €600 million senior secured term loan facility (“Facility B”); and

    - a €170 million senior secured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit
Facility” and, together with Facility B, the “Senior Secured Facilities”).

The Facility B will be borrowed in multiple tranches by borrowers in Germany, France and the
Netherlands (the “Facility B Borrowers”) which may include the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Douglas Finance
B.V., Kirk Beauty Netherlands B.V., Parfümerie Douglas International GmbH, Groupe Nocibé S.A.S., Parfümerie
Douglas GmbH, Nocibé France S.A.S. and Douglas Einkaufs- und Servicegesellschaft mbH & Co.KG.

Each Facility B Borrower shall apply all amounts borrowed by it under Facility B in or towards
(including by way of on-lending: (i) the Transaction; and/or (ii) paying any breakage costs, redemption premia
and/or other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with the Transaction. The Revolving Credit Facility
may be utilized by certain members of the Group (the “Group” consists of TopCo and its restricted
subsidiaries)) in euros, sterling, U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and certain other readily available currencies (subject
to obtaining the consent of all the relevant Revolving Credit Facility lenders) by the drawing of cash advances,
the issue of letters of credit and ancillary facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used for: (i) any of the
purposes for which Facility B may be utilized; (ii) the issue of letters of credit or entry into ancillary facilities to
backstop or replace letters of credit and/or ancillary facilities outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement; and (iii) the Group’s general corporate and working capital purposes, including without
limitation funding of capital expenditure, restructuring costs, acquisitions, any working capital related and
foreign exchange purchase price adjustments relating to any acquisitions and other fees, costs and expenses.

In addition to Facility B and the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement
includes the ability for the Group to incur one or more incremental facilities within the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement (including up to a specified amount as incurred for liquidity purposes in connection with a
government support scheme or state-backed financing ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Facilities
but senior to the Senior Secured Facilities in respect of proceeds of enforcement of the transaction security
(“Super Senior State Supported Debt”) either as separate term or revolving facilities or as increases to Facility B
or the Revolving Credit Facility or any existing incremental facility) up to an aggregate amount, together with
any Incremental Equivalent Debt, of (a) the greater of €300.0 million and 75% of LTM Consolidated EBITDA,
plus (b) in respect of an incremental revolving facility only, €30 million, plus (c) any additional amount so long
as (i) the pro forma senior secured net leverage ratio (being the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt
of the Group to LTM Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (each as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement)) is not more than 4.25x, (ii) to the extent such incremental facility is established to fund an
acquisition permitted under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the senior secured net leverage ratio as
of the last day of the most recently ended financial quarter of TopCo, is equal to or less than the greater of
4.25x and the senior secured net leverage ratio immediately prior thereto (calculated on a pro forma basis for
the drawing in full of such incremental facility and such acquisition) or (iii) the proceeds are applied to refinance

###### 170


-----

_pari passu indebtedness of the Group plus an amount equal to all related fees, costs and expenses, in each_
case, subject to certain conditions being met. The ability to incur incremental facilities is subject to certain
conditions including, in the case of any incremental term loan commitments denominated in euro incurred
within six months of the date on which the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement becomes effective (the
“Effective Date”) and that mature prior to the date two years after the maturity date applicable to Facility B (as in
effect on the Effective Date), that the aggregate yield in respect of those incremental term loan commitments
does not exceed 1.00% per annum more than the yield applicable to Facility B as at the Effective Date (unless
the yield on Facility B is increased such that the yield in respect of the incremental term loan commitments
does not exceed 1.00% per annum more than the increased yield for Facility B).

_Availability_

Subject to satisfaction of applicable conditions precedent, Facility B will be available on the Effective
Date.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from and including the Effective Date until the date which
is one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

_Interest and Fees_

Loans under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement will bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR or, for loans denominated in a currency other than euro, LIBOR (or other appropriate interbank offer
rates for other currencies) in each case, subject to a floor of 0.0%, and the following applicable margins:

    - 5.500% per annum in respect of loans under Facility B; and

    - 4.750% per annum in respect of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility,

subject in each case to a margin ratchet based on the senior secured net leverage ratio of the Group.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility from the Effective Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Accrued commitment
fee will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the relevant availability period and on the cancelled
amount of any lender’s commitment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility at the time such cancellation is
effective.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

_Repayments_

Facility B will be repaid in full on the date that is five years from the Effective Date. In respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto,
subject to an ability to roll over drawings on a cashless basis, subject to compliance with certain customary
conditions. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date that is four
years and nine months from the Effective Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the
Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

_Prepayment_

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreement requires mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain
circumstances, including:

    - on a change of control or sale of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Group;

    - from a percentage of net cash proceeds received by the Group from certain disposals of assets
(including a listing of any shares in a restricted subsidiary of TopCo (other than a listing of the
shares in a restricted subsidiary in connection with the debt pushdown provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement) (a “subsidiary listing”)) which percentage decreases as the Group’s
senior secured net leverage ratio decreases, in each case (other than in respect of a subsidiary
listing) to the extent that such net cash proceeds have not been applied towards the business of
the Group within agreed time periods; and

###### 171


-----

    - for each financial year, a percentage of excess cash flow net of certain deductions which
percentage decreases as the Group’s senior secured net leverage ratio decreases.

The borrower may voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement at any time in whole or in part, subject to de minimis amounts. Amounts prepaid are subject to
break costs and, for any refinancing of Facility B during the first twelve months following the Effective Date
using a term loan facility the primary purpose of which is to reduce the yield applicable to Facility B, 101% soft
call protection.

_Guarantees and Security_

The Senior Secured Facilities will benefit from substantially the same guarantees and security as the
Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Facilities will also benefit from guarantees and security granted by
certain restricted subsidiaries incorporated in France and Italy.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain property, rights and and assets may not be pledged, and any
pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the
agreed security principles in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Agreed Security Principles”). The
following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among
others:

    - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, tax restrictions,
financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization”, “earnings
stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and “capital maintenance” rules, retention of title
claims, employee or works council consultation or approval requirements and similar principles
may limit the ability of TopCo or any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a guarantee or security or
may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit
applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which
TopCo or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may provide having regard to applicable law
(including any jurisprudence);

    - guarantees and security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture
or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not wholly owned
by TopCo and/or any Restricted Subsidiary (or other Restricted Subsidiaries jointly);

that adequate corporate benefit accrues to it and to overcome any such other limitations to the
extent reasonably practicable;

    - the granting of transaction security and the extent of its perfection shall take into account the cost
to TopCo or any Restricted Subsidiary of providing such security (including any increase to the tax
and/or regulatory costs of TopCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries) so as to ensure that, in the
reasonable opinion of TopCo, those costs are proportionate to the benefit accruing to the
secured parties and the maximum amount guaranteed or secured may be limited to minimize
stamp duty notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit
of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes
and duties;

Facilities Agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged, and any cash
constituting regulatory capital or customer cash, will be excluded from any transaction security
document;

    - neither TopCo nor its Restricted Subsidiaries will be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if: (1) they are not wholly-owned by either TopCo and/or a Restricted
Subsidiary (or other Restricted Subsidiaries jointly), or if it is not within the legal capacity of TopCo
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, (2) in the good faith judgement of TopCo, the creation of
transaction security and/or the giving of a guarantee and/or otherwise becoming a Guarantor
would result in any entity being in breach of any law or regulation (or the views, guidance or
interpretation of any relevant regulator), or could materially adversely affect any solvency capital
requirements of TopCo or such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any applicable law or regulation
applicable to TopCo or such Restricted Subsidiary, (3) it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of
their directors or managers, (4) contravene any legal, contractual or regulatory prohibition or
require any regulatory consent or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any
officer; (5) the granting of such guarantee or security may, in the reasonable opinion of TopCo,

###### 172


-----

have an adverse impact on the credit rating of TopCo or such Restricted Subsidiary or any debt or
other instrument issued by TopCo or such Restricted Subsidiary or in respect of which TopCo or
such Restricted Subsidiary is a trustee, corporate administrator or similar or analogous function; or
(6) TopCo or such relevant Restricted Subsidiary is acting as a trustee or similar or analogous
function in a securitization, structured financing or other similar arrangement;

- if there are third party arrangements in place in respect of any asset, business or entity acquired
by TopCo or any Restricted Subsidiary (where those third party arrangements were not entered
into in contemplation of that acquisition) as a result of which the consent of a third party is
required for that acquired entity to provide a guarantee or to secure any acquired asset, such
guarantee and/or security will not be required to be granted;

- the granting or perfection of transaction security, when required, and other legal formalities will
be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within the time periods
specified in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and/or the transaction security documents
therefore or (to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement and/or the transaction security documents) within the time periods specified by
applicable law in order to ensure due perfection, in each case taking into account the Agreed
Security Principles;

- the granting of guarantees, transaction security or perfection of transaction security will not be
required if: (1) it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of TopCo or any Restricted
Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise
permitted by the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or (2) it would be either impossible or
impractical or would unduly disrupt the business of TopCo or any Restricted Subsidiary and, in
each such event, a guarantee will not be granted and/or transaction security will not be taken over
such assets, as applicable (including, without limitation, notification of such security to any third
party);

- the transaction security documents shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in
or otherwise governed or expressed to be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of
incorporation of TopCo or any Restricted Subsidiary;

- no perfection steps will be required to be taken in respect of any transaction security in a
jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction that governs the transaction security document under which
that transaction security is granted;

- the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty,
notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties;

(other than any bank accounts which are part of a cash pool or factoring arrangement to the
extent not permitted under the applicable terms of such cash pool or factoring arrangement); and

obligations.

Intercreditor Agreement

_General_

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors under the financing arrangements, LuxCo3 and Kirk
Beauty 2 Beteiligungs GmbH & Co. KG (the “Original HoldCos” and together with any entity that is the direct
holder of any shares issued in Topco from time to time and which accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as a
HoldCo, “HoldCo”), Topco and certain Subsidiaries of Topco (Topco, together with certain Subsidiaries of
Topco which accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor, the “Debtors”) have entered into the
Intercreditor Agreement, together with each Subsidiary of Topco which has provided financial accommodation
to a Debtor or Debtors in excess of an aggregate threshold amount (and subject to other exceptions) (the
“Intra-Group Liabilities”) and which has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement (or, which in the future
accedes) as an intra-group lender, the “Intra-Group Lenders” and, for the purposes of this section, Topco and
its Subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the “Group”) with, among others, the Security Agent, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and the facility agent under
the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (together with any other entity which accedes as a senior agent under
and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, a “Senior Agent”). The Intercreditor Agreement is
governed by English law and sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the
Debtors, when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors, when enforcement
action can be taken in respect of any transaction security provided in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant
to which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events
and turnover provisions.

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted
the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement. The following description is a summary of certain
provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of
the Notes. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the
Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of
the Notes.

The intercreditor facilitates a number of different types of financing which may be incurred by certain
entities within the Group, including:

(a) any Debtor may be a borrower (subject to any limitations set out in the relevant Senior Facilities
Agreement (as defined below)) (a “Senior Borrower”) under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement,
or any other facilities agreement designated as a “Senior Facilities Agreement” for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement by Topco (each a “Senior Facilities Agreement” and any mandated lead
arranger under such Senior Facilities Agreement, a “Senior Arranger”, any lender, issuing bank or
ancillary lender under such Senior Facilities Agreement, a “Senior Lender” and any liabilities owed by
a Debtor to such Senior Lenders, the “Senior Lender Liabilities”);

(b) any Debtor may enter into any cash management agreement permitted under the Senior Secured
Finance Documents (as defined below) (each a “Cash Management Agreement” and any bank or

On or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Second Lien

_Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of the Senior Agent under
each Senior Facilities Agreement and (to the extent otherwise prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding) the consent of the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee(s), and subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of
_Claims” below, the Debtors shall not make (and Topco shall procure that no member of the Group shall), and_
no Second Lien Creditor may receive from any member of the Group, any Permitted Second Lien Payment
(other than any Entrenched Second Lien Loan Permitted Payment or any Entrenched Second Lien Notes
Permitted Payment) if:

    - a Senior Secured Payment Default, as defined in the section under the caption “—Permitted Senior
_Unsecured Payments” below, is continuing; or_

    - a material event of default (other than a Senior Secured Payment Default) is continuing from the
date which is one business day after the date on which the Senior Agent(s) or the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee(s) (as the case may be) delivers a payment stop notice (a “Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Secured Event of
Default to Topco, the Security Agent and the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) until the
earliest of:

      - the date falling 150 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

      - if a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of
that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

      - the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default has been remedied or waived
in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents;

      - the date on which the relevant Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as
applicable) delivers a notice to Topco, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) cancelling the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

      - the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

###### 185


-----

      - the date on which the Security Agent or a Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) takes
Enforcement Action (as defined below) permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against
a Debtor.

Unless the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) waives this requirement (i) no new Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice may be delivered unless and until 365 days have elapsed since the delivery of the
immediately prior Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be
delivered in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of Default more than 120 days after the date that the Senior
Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) (as applicable) received notice of that Senior Secured Event
of Default.

The Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) may only serve one Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately
preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agent(s) or the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee(s) to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Agent or Senior Secured Notes Trustee in
respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agent(s) or the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee(s) at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Finance Documents as a result of the issue
of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent
(i) the occurrence of an event of default under the Second Lien Finance Documents as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Finance Documents or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice with respect to the relevant event of default on behalf of the Second Lien Creditors (a
“Second Lien Enforcement Notice”).

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest,
which shall continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Finance Document by the operation of the provisions
set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to the Second Lien Creditors and
_the Second Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of_
any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Finance
Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Secured Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be
continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Finance Documents and which would
have been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or
Senior Secured Payment Default, as the case may be,

then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived
and any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall
be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien Creditors.

_Restrictions on Second Lien Enforcement_

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group:

(i) no Second Lien Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the extent
applicable) require the enforcement of, any transaction security; and

(ii) no Second Lien Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation
to the Second Lien Liabilities,

with any member of the Group or (to the extent the Senior Unsecured Shared Security is
affected) Senior Unsecured Security Provider which owes any liabilities, or has given any
security, guarantee or indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the
liabilities of the Group owed to a creditor under the Debt Documents (other than any

or Senior Unsecured Finance Documents); or

        - the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the

member of the Group or (ii) any Senior Unsecured Security Provider to the extent the
Senior Unsecured Shared Security is affected, or any analogous procedure or step in any
jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action:

point immediately above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary) to preserve the
validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the registration of
such claims before any court or governmental authority and the bringing, supporting or

with no claim for damages, and (C) requesting judicial interpretation of any provision of any
Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages; or

      - bringing legal proceedings against any person in connection with any securities violation,
securities or listing regulations or common law fraud or to restrain any actual or putative

damages.

_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group (a) no Second Lien Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the
extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any transaction security; and (b) no Second Lien Creditor shall
take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities, other than where:

(i) at the same time as, or prior to, that action, Enforcement Action has been taken in respect of
the Senior Secured Liabilities, in which case the Second Lien Creditors may take the same
Enforcement Action as has been taken in respect of those Senior Secured Liabilities; or

(ii)

(A) an event of default under the Second Lien Finance Documents (the “Relevant
Second Lien Default”) is continuing;

(B) the Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) have received a notice

the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default from the
relevant Second Lien Creditor Representative(s);

###### 188


-----

(C) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(D) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second
Lien Standstill Period.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period
beginning on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Second Lien Creditor
Representative(s) serves a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on the Senior Agent(s) and the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee(s) in respect of such Relevant Second Lien Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 150 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date (the “Second Lien
Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Creditors take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
Debtor, provided, however, that:

(A) if a Second Lien Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Second Lien
Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Debtor as
the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Creditors against such Debtor
and not against any other member of the Group; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken
to preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to a particular Debtor against whom Enforcement
Action is to be taken (in which case the Second Lien Standstill Period shall end only in relation
to that Debtor);

(iv) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of
a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); and

(v) the date on which the Majority Senior Lenders and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) give
their prior consent to the termination of the relevant Second Lien Standstill Period.

_Subsequent Second Lien Defaults_

The Second Lien Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
“—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the end
of any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period has
begun as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Representatives that it is enforcing security over
shares of a Debtor, no Second Lien Creditor may take any Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in
caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above against that Debtor or any Restricted Subsidiary of that
Debtor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce security created in accordance with the instructions
of the Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or
the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

If the Second Lien Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the
enforcement of the security in accordance with the provisions set out in caption “-Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement” above, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of the relevant security by way of a_
sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Second Lien and

The Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) or the Second Lien Creditor

Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) or the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) to issue a
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a Second

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or Senior
Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement as a result of the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or
the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default
as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Unsecured Finance
Documents or Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement; or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice with
respect to the relevant event of default on behalf of the Senior Unsecured Creditors (a “Senior Unsecured
Enforcement Notice”).

Notwithstanding anything else in the Intercreditor Agreement, no Senior Unsecured Payment Stop
Notice will prevent the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer or Senior Unsecured Borrower from making a payment
from its own assets if that payment is of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior
Unsecured Notes or the Senior Unsecured Borrower’s obligations under the Senior Unsecured Loan Finance
Documents and such payment is not financed by a payment to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer or the Senior
Unsecured Borrower from a member of the Group that was prohibited by the Senior Secured Finance
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement at the time such payment was made.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest,
which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Unsecured Finance Document or Senior Unsecured Proceeds

###### 192


-----

Loan Agreement by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption
“—Restrictions Relating to the Senior Unsecured Creditors and the Senior Unsecured Liabilities” even if its
obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Unsecured Finance
Documents or a Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence
of a Senior Secured Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment Default, that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the
Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing;
and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Unsecured Creditors (or, in respect of
the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities only, the Senior Unsecured Borrower or
Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under
the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan
Agreement and which would have been Permitted Senior Unsecured Payments but for that
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice, Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default, as the case may be,

then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived
and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default
shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Unsecured
Creditors (or, in respect of the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities only, the Senior Unsecured
Borrower or Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer).

_Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Enforcement_

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group:

(i) no Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to
the extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any transaction security (and such term
does not include the Senior Unsecured Only Security);

(ii) no Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action
in relation to the Senior Unsecured Guarantees; and

(iii) no Senior Unsecured Finance Party, Senior Unsecured Borrower or Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer shall require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Unsecured
_Enforcement” below._

_Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement_

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Enforcement” above will
not apply in respect of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities or
the transaction security documents (if any) which secure the Senior Unsecured Liabilities as permitted by
paragraph (iii) set out under the caption “—Restriction on Payment and Dealings” above, if:

(i) an event of default under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents (the “Relevant Senior
Unsecured Default”) is continuing;

(ii) the Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and the Second Lien Creditor
Representative(s) have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default (a “Senior
Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the
Relevant Senior Unsecured Default from the Senior Unsecured Representative(s);

###### 193


-----

(iii) a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period.

_Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period shall mean the
period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee(s), the Second Lien Agent(s) and the Second Lien Notes Trustee(s) in respect of such Relevant
Senior Unsecured Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Creditors or the Second Lien Creditors take any Enforcement
Action in relation to a Debtor or (in respect of the Senior Unsecured Shared Security) Senior
Unsecured Security Provider, provided, however, that:

(A) if a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior
Unsecured Finance Parties (or Senior Unsecured Borrower and/or Senior Unsecured
Issuer in respect of the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only
take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Debtor or (in respect of the
Senior Unsecured Shared Security), Senior Unsecured Security Provider as the
Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Creditors against such Debtor or
(in respect of the Senior Unsecured Shared Security) Senior Unsecured Security
Provider and not against any other member of the Group; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken
to preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to a particular Debtor against whom Enforcement
Action is to be taken (in which case the Senior Unsecured Standstill Period shall end only in
relation to that Debtor);

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Unsecured Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Unsecured Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a
result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); and

(v) the date on which the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors consent to an
enforcement in respect of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default by the relevant Senior
Unsecured Finance Parties.

_Subsequent Senior Unsecured Defaults_

The Senior Unsecured Finance Parties (or Senior Unsecured Borrower and/or Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer in respect of the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take Enforcement Action under
the provisions set out in caption “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant
Senior Unsecured Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period or at any later
time, a further Senior Unsecured Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Unsecured Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Senior Unsecured Finance Parties_

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Unsecured Representatives that it is enforcing security
over shares of a Debtor, no Senior Unsecured Finance Party (or Senior Unsecured Borrower and/or Senior
Unsecured Notes Issuer in respect of the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take any
Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement” above
against that Debtor or any Restricted Subsidiary of that Debtor while the Security Agent is taking steps to
enforce security created pursuant to any security document over shares of a Debtor in accordance with the
instructions of the Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such
enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

If the Senior Unsecured Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require
the enforcement of the security (other than the Senior Unsecured Only Security) in accordance with the

###### 194


-----

preceding paragraph, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of the relevant security by way of a
sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Second Lien and
_Senior Unsecured Debt Protection”._

_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_

An “Insolvency Event”, in relation to any member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider
(other than pursuant to certain permitted transactions under and as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement) means (other than where matters are frivolous or vexatious and are discharged, stayed or
dismissed within 20 Business Days of commencement, any matters in relation to a reorganization, merger or
liquidation that is permitted under the Debt Documents or any liquidation of a member of the Group which is
not required to be a Debtor):

    - any member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider commences legal proceedings
in relation to, or a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order for, the winding-up, bankruptcy,
or dissolution (including a redressement judiciaire, cession totale de l’entreprise, liquidation
_judiciaire or a procédure de sauvegarde (including the sauvegarde accélérée and the sauvegarde_
_financière accélérée) under “Livre VI” of the French Commercial Code but excluding any mandat_
_ad hoc or conciliation) of any member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider;_

    - any general composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement is made with its creditors
generally as a result of any financial difficulty on the part of that member of the Group or Senior
Unsecured Security Provider (other than a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement
with the creditors in their capacities as such or any Investor, Senior Unsecured Security Provider,
TopCo or any subsidiary of TopCo and excluding any mandate ad hoc or conciliation);

    - other than on a solvent basis, the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, administrator, judicial
manager, administrative receiver, compulsory manager or interim manager, an examiner or other
similar officer (excluding any conciliateur or any mandataire ad hoc) is appointed in respect of that
member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider or all or a material part of their
respective assets; or

    - any other insolvency proceeding or analogous procedure those described above is taken with
respect to a member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider is taken in any
jurisdiction

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to
any member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider, any party entitled to receive a distribution
out of the assets of that member of the Group or (in respect of the assets which are subject to the Senior
Unsecured Shared Security only) Senior Unsecured Security Provider (in the case of a Primary Creditor (other
than a Senior Unsecured Creditor) on or after the Term Lender Discharge Date, only to the extent that such
amount constitutes Enforcement Proceeds) in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is
able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group or (in
respect of a Senior Unsecured Security Provider) the assets which are subject to the Senior Unsecured Shared
Security only to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have
been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

Generally, to the extent that any member of Group’s liabilities are discharged by way of set-off
(mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the Group,
any creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement which benefited from that set-off shall (in the case of a
Primary Creditor (other than a Senior Unsecured Creditor) on or after the Term Lender Discharge Date, only to
the extent that such amount constitutes Enforcement Proceeds) pay an amount equal to the amount of the
liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the provisions set out in the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the liabilities owed to them by a member of the Group, the liabilities will not be reduced by
that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such
liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any member of Group or, in respect of
paragraph (i) below only, a Senior Unsecured Security Provider, each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor
Agreement irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group or (in respect of the taking of any steps to enforce or

###### 195


-----

require the enforcement of the Senior Unsecured Shared Security) a Senior Unsecured
Security Provider;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities
owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of Group’s
liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of Group’s liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents including voting any Senior Unsecured Liabilities in favor of a plan or
reorganization approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Majority
Second Lien Creditors (as applicable).

Each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement will (i) do all things that the Security Agent
reasonably requests in order to give effect to the matters disclosed under this section “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” and (ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by_
this section or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement take that
action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of
attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require, although no
trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take
such action.

_Turnover by the Primary Creditors_

Subject to certain customary exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that:

(a) if (at any time prior to the Final Discharge Date) a Senior Unsecured Creditor or (at any time prior to
the Term Lender Discharge Date only) any other Primary Creditor, receives or recovers from any
member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider:

amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
(y) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and
(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal
to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

to the Final Discharge Date, any creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a Primary
Creditor) receives or recovers from any member of the Group or Senior Unsecured Security Provider:

Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the transaction security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the
Instructing Group, and, in each case, if the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Senior Unsecured

If the transaction security is being enforced or other action as to enforcement is being taken as set
forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the transaction
security or take such other action as to enforcement in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection
of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of any Debtor or Senior Unsecured Security
Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

    - the Instructing Group;

    - prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third
paragraph under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions” received instructions given by the
Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce the transaction security and (ii) the Instructing Group
has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the transaction security, the Majority

by the Security Agent, inform any relevant court, administrator, liquidator, or similar officer of the right of the
Security Agent to act on behalf of that creditor as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement and to send a notice
to such court, administrator, liquidator, or similar officer to confirm that the Security Agent is acting on behalf of
the relevant creditor, and inviting them to send any letter or convening notice relating to the Insolvency Event
of the creditor directly to the Security Agent (with a copy to such creditor). A copy of such notice shall be sent
as soon as reasonably practicable to the Security Agent.

Each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement irrevocably undertakes not to challenge in any
manner (i) the terms of this paragraph “—Exercise of Voting Rights”, (ii) any vote or representation made or any

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, each Senior Unsecured Security Provider and the Debtors waives all
rights it may otherwise have to require that the transaction security be enforced in any particular order or
manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the transaction security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being
applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, the Senior Unsecured Security
Providers and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to

and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Second Lien Creditor and/or Senior Unsecured Finance Party (as
applicable) in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management
or realization of any of that transaction security shall (save as set out under the fourth paragraph of the caption
“—Distressed Disposals”) be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver
or delegate to the Debtors and Senior Unsecured Security Providers under general law.

Each of the Secured Parties, the Senior Unsecured Security Providers and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the transaction security after the
Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent
and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior Unsecured Finance Party in respect of the method, type
and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that transaction
security shall (save as set out under the fourth paragraph of the caption “—Distressed Disposals”) be no different
to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors and the
Senior Unsecured Security Providers under general law.

good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group or, as applicable, the Majority Second
Lien Creditors or the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors for a period of up to 10 days (or such shorter period
as each Creditor Representative and the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only
following the expiry of a Consultation Period, the Instructing Group, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or the
Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors (as applicable) shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the transaction security or take any other Enforcement Action.

No Creditor Representative shall be obliged to consult as set out above and the Instructing Group or,

to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the transaction security or take any other Enforcement
Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if:

(a) the transaction security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(b) the Instructing Group or, as applicable the Majority Second Lien Creditors or the Majority Senior
Unsecured Creditors or any Creditor Representative of the creditors represented in the Instructing
Group determines in good faith (and notifies each Creditor Representative and the Security Agent)
that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the
transaction security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the transaction security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the transaction security.

_Enforcement of Security—On or Following the Term Lender Discharge Date_

_Instructions to Enforce_

If either the Majority Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors wish to issue enforcement
instructions, the Agents (and if applicable Hedge Counterparties) representing the Primary Creditors

###### 200


-----

comprising the Majority Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, as the case may be, shall deliver a
copy of the proposed enforcement instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to
each Agent and each Hedge Counterparty who did not deliver such Initial Enforcement Notice.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Pari
Passu Creditors save that where:

(i) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either:

(A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security
Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing), or

(B) appointed a financial adviser pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to assist
them in making such a determination,

within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, or

(ii) neither the Senior Lender Discharge Date, the Cash Management Discharge Date nor the Super
Senior Hedging Discharge Date (the later of which, the “Super Senior Discharge Date”) have occurred
within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the Enforcement Instructions received from the Majority
Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

If an Insolvency Event is continuing with respect to a Debtor, then the Security Agent will, to the extent
the Majority Senior Creditors elect to provide such enforcement instructions, act in accordance with
enforcement instructions received from the Majority Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred.

If the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either:

(i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to
pursue (and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing); or

(ii) appointed a financial adviser in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to assist
them in making such a determination,

and the Majority Senior Creditors: (A) determine in good faith (and notify the other Agents, the Hedge
Counterparties and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or
on the expected realized proceeds of enforcement and (B) deliver enforcement instructions which they
reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement objectives under the Intercreditor Agreement and
necessary or advisable in enhancing the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives under the
Intercreditor Agreement before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority
Pari Passu Creditor, then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received
from the Majority Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

“Super Senior Hedging Discharge Date” means first date on which all Super Senior Hedging Liabilities
have been fully and finally discharged, whether or not as the result of an enforcement, and no Super Senior
Hedge Counterparties (in that capacity) are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation to
any of the Debtors under the Debt Documents.

“Cash Management Discharge Date” means the first date on which all the Cash Management
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged, whether or not as the result of an enforcement and the Cash
Management Providers (in that capacity) are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation to
any of the Debtors under the Debt Documents.

“Senior Lender Discharge Date” means the first date on which all Senior Lender Liabilities have been
fully and finally discharged, whether or not as the result of an enforcement, and the Senior Lenders (in that
capacity) are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation to any of the Debtors under any
of the Debt Documents.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the transaction security or taking any other action as to
enforcement unless instructed otherwise by the Instructing Group as set out under the provisions set out under

###### 201


-----

the above caption titled “—Instructions to Enforce—On or Following the Term Lender Discharge Date.” Subject to
the provisions set out under the above caption titled “—Instructions to Enforce—On or Following the Term
_Lender Discharge Date”, the Instructing Group may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security_
Agent to take action as to enforcement in accordance with the enforcement principles set out under the
Intercreditor Agreement as they see fit by way of issuance of enforcement instructions.

Prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, (i) if the Instructing Group has instructed the Security
Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the transaction security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the
Instructing Group, and, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Senior Unsecured
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the security which the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the provisions
under the caption titled “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above.

Prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date or the Second Lien Discharge Date, (i) if the
Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the transaction
security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group, and in each case, (A) the Instructing
Group has not and in the case of (i), has confirmed in its instructions to the Security Agent that it has not,
required any Debtor or Senior Unsecured Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below)

the Transaction Security as described under caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above, the Security
Agent shall effect to any instructions to enforce the transaction security which the Senior Unsecured Creditors
are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the provisions under the caption titled “—Permitted Senior
_Unsecured Enforcement” above._

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraphs, if at any time the Second Lien Creditor
Representative(s) or the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) as applicable are then entitled to give the Security
Agent instructions to enforce the transaction security pursuant to the applicable preceding paragraph above or
the Senior Unsecured Shared Security pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph (as applicable) and
the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) or the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) (as applicable) either
gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the transaction security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of
any instructions to enforce given by the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) under the provisions set out
under the caption titled “- Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above or the Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) under the provisions set out under the caption titled “—Permitted Senior Unsecured
_Enforcement” above (as applicable) and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the_
Instructing Group (and the Security Agent shall immediately cease any conflicting actions pursued or taken
pursuant to the instructions of the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) or the Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) (as applicable) without any liability to any Second Lien Creditors or Senior Unsecured
Creditors (as applicable) for any loss, costs, damages and/or expenses that may arise of a result of it ceasing
any such conflicting actions (whether or not the Security Agent is aware that such loss, costs, damages and/or
expenses may arise)).

No secured party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to any of the
transaction security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the transaction security
documents except through the Security Agent. Any decision to enforce the transaction security will be taken by
the Instructing Group in accordance with these provisions or the provisions set out under the caption
“Enforcement of Security—Prior to the Term Lender Discharge Date” above, as applicable, and shall be binding
on all of the Secured Parties. Each Secured Party (other than the Security Agent) unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees to grant a full power of attorney in favor of the Security Agent so that the Security Agent may
enforce the transaction security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the transaction security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption titled “—Enforcement
_Instructions—On or Following the Term Lender Discharge Date,” the Security Agent shall enforce the transaction_
security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Senior
Unsecured Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

    - the Instructing Group; or

    - prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the second
paragraph of the preceding section, received instructions given by the Majority Second Lien
Creditors to enforce the transaction security; and (ii) the Instructing Group has not given
instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the transaction security, the Majority Second Lien
Creditors; or

###### 202


-----

    - prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date if

instructions given by the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors to enforce the transaction security
which benefits the Senior Unsecured Creditors and (ii) the Instructing Group has not given
instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the transaction security, the Majority Senior
Unsecured Creditors,

shall instruct (in a manner consistent with the enforcement principles under the Intercreditor Agreement) or, in
the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent may (but will not be obliged to) consider in its
discretion to be appropriate and consistent with the enforcement principles under the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

Following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of any Debtor, each creditor regulated by
the Intercreditor Agreement (i) agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law at the relevant time) with the
Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to a vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial
or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings
relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent; and (ii) irrevocably authorizes the
Security Agent, to the extent permitted by law and in relation to that creditor’s claims, to exercise all powers of
voting and representation in relation to that Debtor in respect of any such proceedings, and on that creditor’s
behalf and will provide (promptly and in any event within 3 Business Days following request by the Security
Agent) all forms of proxy and representation and/or irrevocable powers of attorney (including by way of
security) requested by the Security Agent for such purpose

The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an
Instructing Group.

Each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement shall, following the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in respect of any Debtor, promptly and in any event within 3 Business Days following request
by the Security Agent, inform any relevant court, administrator, liquidator, or similar officer of the right of the
Security Agent to act on behalf of that creditor as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement and to send a notice
to such court, administrator, liquidator, or similar officer to confirm that the Security Agent is acting on behalf of
the relevant creditor, and inviting them to send any letter or convening notice relating to the Insolvency Event
of the creditor directly to the Security Agent (with a copy to such creditor). A copy of such notice shall be sent
as soon as reasonably practicable to the Security Agent.

Each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement irrevocably undertakes not to challenge in any
manner (i) the terms of this paragraph “—Exercise of Voting Rights”, (ii) any vote or representation made or any
position taken by the Security Agent or (iii) any restructuring plan or any judgment or court decision approving
any restructuring plan, undertaken in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and in particular the
provisions set out in this paragraph “—Exercise of Voting Rights”.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, the Senior Unsecured Security Providers and the Debtors waives all
rights it may otherwise have to require that the transaction security be enforced in any particular order or
manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the transaction security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being
applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, the Senior Unsecured Security
Providers and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to
enforce, the transaction security prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent
and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Second Lien Creditor or Senior Unsecured Finance Party (as
applicable) in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management
or realization of any of that security shall (save as set out under the fourth paragraph of the caption “—Distressed
_Disposals”) be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate_
to the Debtors or the Senior Unsecured Security Providers under general law.

Each of the Secured Parties, the Senior Unsecured Security Providers and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the transaction security after the

###### 203


-----

Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent
and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior Unsecured Finance Party in respect of the method, type
and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that transaction
security shall (save as set out under the fourth paragraph of the caption “—Distressed Disposals”) be no different
to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors or Senior
Unsecured Security Providers under general law.

_Alternative Enforcement Action_

After the Security Agent has commented Enforcement, it shall not accept any subsequent instructions
as to enforcement (save for any subsequent instructions in accordance with the final paragraph (prior to the
defined terms) set out under the caption “—Instructions to Enforce” above) from anyone other than the
Instructing Group that instructed it to commence such enforcement of the transaction security regarding any
other enforcement of the transaction security over or relating to shares or assets directly or indirectly the
subject of the enforcement of the transaction security which has been commenced.

_Enforcement of Senior Unsecured Only Security_

The Senior Unsecured Creditors may not give instructions to the Security Agent as to the enforcement
of the Senior Unsecured Only Security other than in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security
Agent may refrain from enforcing the Senior Unsecured Only Security or taking any other Enforcement Action
in respect of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities unless instructed otherwise by the Majority Senior Unsecured
Creditors.

Subject to the Senior Unsecured Only Security having become enforceable, the Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors) may give or refrain
from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Senior Unsecured Only
Security as it sees fit.

No Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse
to, any Senior Unsecured Only Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the documents
relating to the Senior Unsecured Only Security except through the Security Agent. Any decision to enforce the
Senior Unsecured Only Security will be taken by the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors in accordance with
these provisions and will be binding on all of the Senior Unsecured Creditors.

If the Senior Unsecured Only Security is being enforced or other action as to enforcement is being
taken pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will enforce the Senior
Unsecured Only Security or take such other action as to enforcement in respect thereof in such manner
(including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of
any Senior Unsecured Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as the Majority Senior
Unsecured Creditors instruct or, in the absence of such instructions, the Security Agent may (but will not be
obliged to) act as it sees fit.

Each of the Senior Creditors, Senior Unsecured Security Providers and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the Senior Unsecured Only
Security prior to the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or
delegate owed to the any Senior Unsecured Finance Party in respect of the method, type and timing of that
enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that Senior Unsecured Only Security
shall be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the
Debtors or the Senior Unsecured Security Providers under general law.

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Unsecured Security Providers and the Debtors waives all rights it may
otherwise have to require that the Senior Unsecured Only Security be enforced in any particular order or
manner or at any particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the Senior Unsecured Only Security or of any other security interest, which is capable of
being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Senior Lender Liabilities which benefit from Senior
Unsecured Only Security is so applied.

After the Security Agent has commenced an enforcement of the Senior Unsecured Only Security it will
not accept any subsequent instructions as to enforcement thereof from anyone other than the Majority Senior
Unsecured Creditors that instructed it in respect of such enforcement regarding any other enforcement over or
relating to the Senior Unsecured Only Security the subject of the enforcement which has been commenced.
This will not restrict the right of any other Senior Unsecured Creditors to instruct the Security Agent as to

###### 204


-----

enforcement of the Senior Unsecured Only Security that includes any shares or assets which are not directly or
indirectly the subject of a prior instruction as to enforcement.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Senior Unsecured Only Security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then such
creditors may only enforce that Senior Unsecured Only Security in accordance with instructions given by the
Senior Unsecured Representative(s) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Representative(s) and the Senior Unsecured Representative(s);

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding

owed to any other Debtor (the “Debtor Liabilities”) by that Debtor or holding company or any
Restricted Subsidiary of that Debtor or subsidiary of that holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent does not intend that any transferee of those Liabilities or
Debtor Liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured
Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt
Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured

any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the Liabilities owed to the
Primary Creditors and all or part of any other Liabilities and the Debtor Liabilities, on
behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance

###### 207


-----

with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving
Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any Restricted
Subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities or the Debtor
Liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders and
Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which
owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part
of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect
of those Intra- Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of Liabilities or
Debtor Liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the
transaction security and, to the extent that any disposal of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that
disposal of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities had not occurred.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities
transferred to Topco or Holdco, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and empowered (at
the cost of the relevant Debtor or Topco and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation
from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing
liabilities.

_Second Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt Protection_

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of certain Liabilities) effected by, or at the request of,
the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent
shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of Liabilities in order to
achieve a higher price).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, unless the Agents of
the Second Lien Creditors and/or Senior Unsecured Creditors (as applicable) otherwise agree, a Distressed
Disposal or disposal of liabilities which results in the release of any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities
in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Unsecured Liabilities or the release of any transaction security
securing the Second Lien Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Liabilities may, in each case, only be made if:

(i)

(A) the consideration in respect of such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities is
paid in cash (or substantially all in cash); or

(B) the consideration in respect of such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities does
not comprise cash (or substantially all cash) in circumstances where the Security
Agent (acting reasonably) determines that the cash consideration payable under the
highest of the other bona fide and fully committed offers made in relation to that
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities is less than the outstanding Senior
Secured Liabilities, in which case the non-cash consideration can, without limitation,
take the form of the Senior Secured Creditors (or any of them acting alone or
together) bidding by any appropriate mechanic all or part of their Senior Secured
Liabilities (such that the Senior Secured Liabilities would, on completion, be
discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the
relevant Senior Secured Creditors),

and the proceeds of such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities are applied in
accordance with the section headed “—Application of Proceeds” below;

###### 208


-----

(ii)


(A)

(I) the sale, disposal or transfer is made pursuant to a public auction or a
competitive bid process (which auction or process, without prejudice to the
requirements of sub-paragraph (i) above, may be (but does not have to be)
completed by a process or proceedings approved by or supervised by, or
on behalf of, any court of law) or any other process agreed to by the
Agent(s) of the Second Lien Creditors and (to the extent that guarantee
liabilities owed to the Senior Unsecured Creditors have been, or are
proposed to be, released by the Security Agent in connection with the
relevant Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities) the Senior Unsecured
Creditors in each case in which:

(aa) the Second Lien Creditors and the relevant Senior Unsecured
Creditors (on the basis of equal information and access rights as
other bidders and financiers in the process); and

(bb) if such auction or process attracts, or could reasonably be
expected to result in attracting, no bidders or a bona fide and fully
committed cash bid the cash consideration in relation to which is
determined by the Security Agent (acting reasonably) to be less
than the outstanding amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the
Senior Secured Creditors (or any of them acting alone or together),

are (subject to applicable law) entitled to participate as bidders or financiers
to the potential purchaser(s) or, following the sale, disposal or transfer, the
Group; and

(II) the Security Agent (or the relevant member of the Group or Senior
Unsecured Security Provider) shall have, in respect of such auction or
process, consulted with an internationally recognized investment bank or
internationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Security Agent
(acting reasonably) with respect to the procedures which may reasonably
be expected to be used to obtain a fair market price in the then prevailing
market conditions (taking into account all relevant circumstances and with a
view to facilitating a prompt and expeditious sale at a fair market price in
the prevailing market conditions although there shall be no obligation to
postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price), and shall have
implemented (to the extent permitted by law) in all material respects the
procedures recommended by such bank or firm in relation to such auction
or process, unless the Security Agent (acting in good faith) confirms that it
has reasonable grounds to believe that implementation of all or part of such
recommended procedures is not in the best interests of the Senior Secured
Creditors; or

(B) in circumstances where the Security Agent has received an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Group and which can be relied upon by the Security
Agent and disclosed to the Agents of the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien
Creditors and the Senior Unsecured Creditors (but which may be given on the basis
that the liability of the relevant bank or firm in giving the opinion is limited to an
amount of at least the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement)) from:

(I) an internationally recognized investment bank or internationally recognized
accounting firms; or

(II) if it is not practicable for the Security Agent to appoint any such bank or firm
on commercially reasonable terms (including for reasons of conflicts of
interest), another third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
providing valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets but which is not
a Senior Secured Creditor or affiliated thereto,

(in each case not being the firm appointed as the relevant Debtor’s administrator or
other relevant officer holder) selected by the Security Agent confirming that the sale,

###### 209


-----

disposal or transfer price is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all
relevant circumstances, although there shall be no obligation to postpone any such
sale, disposal or transfer in order to achieve a higher price; and

(iii) at the time of completion of the sale, disposal or transfer: (aa) the borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities and (to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other
liabilities owing to each of the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the
Senior Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors being disposed of (each a “Relevant Claim”) are
(to the same extent) released and discharged (and are not assumed by the purchaser and/or
its Affiliates); and (bb) all the transaction security granted in favor of all the Secured Parties
over the assets sold or disposed of is released and discharged unless:

(A) the Agents of the Senior Secured Creditors, acting reasonably and in good faith,
determine that a sale, disposal or transfer of a Relevant Claim will facilitate a recovery
by the Senior Secured Creditors that is greater than the one they would achieve if
such Relevant Claim was released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the
outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there
are no bidders or if the Agents of the Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed cash bids in excess of
the amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities; and

(B) the Agents of the Senior Secured Creditors give notice of their determination to the
Security Agent,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer the
Relevant Claims to such purchaser (or an Affiliate of such purchaser) (or, if
sub-paragraph(ii)(A)(I)(aa) above applies and a Senior Secured Creditor is the successful
bidder (or financier) or beneficiary of the relevant disposal as contemplated in paragraph(ii)
above, such Senior Secured Creditor shall be able to retain its Relevant Claim or any part
thereof (which shall be valued at par)).

guarantee or debt arrangement and related security including, without limitation, by way of refinancing,
replacement, exchange, set-off, discharge or increase of any new, existing, additional or supplemental

existence at the time of any accessions to the Intercreditor Agreement in respect thereof and including
arrangements existing at the time a person becomes a member of the Group (whether by acquisition, merger,
consolidation or combination) or assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets, merger, consolidation
or combination or otherwise); including by way of any loan, note (including super senior, senior or second lien
secured, senior unsecured, senior subordinated or subordinated notes, whether in each case in a public or
private offering, Rule 144A or other offering), bond or otherwise (including, in each case, term or revolving);
issued or incurred, and together with any guarantee, security or other credit support by any member of the
Group (a “New Debt Financing”) provided that Topco (or, in respect of any Senior Unsecured Finance
Documents, Holdco) certifies to each Agent and Security Agent that it is not prohibited under any Debt
Document and it otherwise complies with the requirements (if any) of the then existing Debt Documents

Documents). The New Debt Financing will, to the extent designated by Topco (in a manner which does not
breach the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the other relevant Debt Documents) have the relevant

liabilities.

instructed by all Creditors to enter into promptly any new security document, promptly amend or waive any

###### 214


-----

terms of an existing security document or Senior Unsecured Only Security Document and/or promptly release
any asset from the transaction security or Senior Unsecured Only Security provided that (a) any new transaction
security be, subject to certain agreed security principles, guarantee limitations, applicable law and the
Intercreditor Agreement, granted in favor of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the providers and/or
agents and/or trustees of a New Debt Financing and the then existing Secured Parties and on terms
substantially the same as the terms of the existing Transaction Security over equivalent assets (unless otherwise
agreed by Topco and the Security Agent); (b) any new Senior Unsecured Only Security shall be, subject to any
agreed security principles, guarantee limitations, applicable law and the Intercreditor Agreement, granted in
favor of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the providers and/or agents and/or trustees of a New Debt
Financing and the then existing Senior Unsecured Creditors and on terms substantially the same as the terms
of the existing Senior Unsecured Only Security over equivalent assets (unless otherwise agreed by Holdco and
the Security Agent) (c) any amendment or waiver of a transaction security document, Senior Unsecured Only
Security Document or release and re-grant of transaction security or Senior Unsecured Only Security shall only
be undertaken if required by the terms and conditions of the New Debt Financing or necessary under
applicable law to give effect to the ranking set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and, if legally possibly and in
the opinion of Topco (acting reasonably) it is not commercially detrimental to do so and without breach of any
term or condition of the New Debt Financing, second or further priority transaction security or Senior
Unsecured Only Security shall be taken instead on the basis that the liabilities under such New Debt Financing
will nonetheless be deemed and treated under the Intercreditor Agreement as secured by the existing security
documents and the additional transaction security documents or Senior Unsecured Only Security pari passu
with the existing liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking; and (c) if any asset is to be released,
promptly after giving effect to that release and subject to applicable law, the Debt Documents, certain agreed
security principles, guarantee limitations and the Intercreditor Agreement, replacement transaction security or
Senior Unsecured Only Security is granted in favor of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the providers
and/or agents and/or trustees of the New Debt Financing and the existing Secured Parties benefitting from the
security on substantially the same terms as the transaction security or Senior Unsecured Only Security released.

_IPO Debt Pushdown_

On or following a public equity offering of a member of the Group or a Holding Company of TopCo
(an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to the release of Transaction Security or
Senior Unsecured Only Security if required to implement such IPO Event), TopCo shall be entitled to require
(by written notice to each Agent, each Hedge Counterparty and each Cash Management Provider (a
“Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Debt Documents shall automatically operate (with effect from the
date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis of the following principles:

(i) (A) if the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date has occurred, the listed entity (the “Listed Entity”)
shall become top of the Group for the purposes of the Senior Secured Finance Documents
and the Second Lien Finance Documents and Group shall refer to the Listed Entity and its
Subsidiaries; or (B) if the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date has not occurred, the Listed Entity
or a direct subsidiary of the Listed Entity shall become the SUN Borrower/Issuer and, for the
purposes of the Senior Secured Finance Documents and Second Lien Finance Documents,
Group shall refer to a direct Subsidiary (which is not the SUN Borrower/Issuer) of the Listed
Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the Listed
Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the Listed Entity;

(iii) each reference in the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document to Topco shall be
deemed to be a reference to the Listed Entity (or if, the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date has
not occurred, a direct subsidiary of the Listed Entity which is not the SUN Borrower / Issuer)
and this deeming construct and no action taken by such entity or prior to it being deemed as
Topco shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Debt Documents or a default or
event of default;

(iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or events of default in the Debt
Documents shall apply to any holding company of the Listed Entity (whether in is capacity as a
Debtor or otherwise);

(v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the Listed Entity
(whether in its capacity as an Debtor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other
term in the Debt Documents or a default or an event of default;

###### 215


-----

(vi) any borrowing liabilities in respect of the Secured Debt Documents will be (and will be
deemed to have been) novated or otherwise transferred to a member of the Group (as
defined following the Pushdown Date) nominated by Topco provided that (A) such member
of the Group is incorporated in the same jurisdiction as the relevant existing Senior Secured
Borrower, Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Second Lien Borrower, Second Lien Notes Issuer,
Senior Unsecured Borrower and/or Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer, (B) any requirements
under the Intercreditor Agreement as to the identity (as set out under the caption “- General”
above) of any Senior Secured Borrower, Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Second Lien Borrower,
Second Lien Notes Issuer, Senior Unsecured Borrower and/or Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer
must be adhered to (once the provisions set out in this section have taken effect) and (C) it
would not be unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for the relevant Senior Secured Creditor,
Second Lien Creditor or Senior Unsecured Creditor to perform any of its obligations under
the Debt Document as a result of such novation or transfer (and if such novation or transfer
would be unlawful for Senior Secured Creditor, Second Lien Creditor or Senior Unsecured
Creditor Topco shall have the right to prepay, repay or redeem the relevant Senior Secured
Creditor, Second Lien Creditor or Senior Unsecured Creditor at par) provided that each
Senior Secured Creditor, Second Lien Creditor and Senior Unsecured Creditor shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate any circumstances which may result in such unlawfulness;

(vii) each holding company of the Listed Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released
from all obligations and restrictions under the Debt Documents (including any transaction
security, or as the case may be, Senior Unsecured Only Security granted by any such Holding
Company of the Listed Entity or as a guarantor or Debtor); and

(viii) unless otherwise notified by Topco:

(A) each Investor, Holdco and Senior Unsecured Security Provider (including in any
capacity referred to in any of the aforementioned definitions) (each in such capacity,
a “Released Person”) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the
Intercreditor Agreement and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement (and from the date specified by Topco that person shall cease to be
Party in the applicable capacity as a Released Person and shall have no further rights
or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement in that capacity); and

(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party as a
Released Person.

In the event that any person is released from or ceases to be or become a party as a Released Person
under these provisions, any term of any Debt Document which requires or assumes that any person be a
Released Person or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

Following an IPO Event, with the consent (as applicable) of each of the Majority Senior Lenders, the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Majority Second Lien Lenders, the Second Lien Notes Trustee, the Majority
Unsecured Lenders and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee (to be calculated pro forma to their participations
in the applicable Debt Documents after the IPO Event to the extent any liabilities under such Debt Documents
will remain outstanding and as applicable for the purposes of those definitions at such time), each Senior
Unsecured Security Provider, the Listed Entity and each subsidiary of the Listed Entity shall, immediately upon
the Listed Entity giving written notice to the Security Agent, be irrevocably and unconditionally released from
all obligations and restrictions as a Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and any transaction
security granted thereby (other than, in each case, any borrowing liabilities).

_Required Consents_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it may be amended or
waived only with the consent of Topco, (to the extent a party) the Agent(s), the relevant Senior Secured Notes
Trustee(s), the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s), the relevant Senior Unsecured Representative(s) and
the Security Agent.

Other than in respect of the implementation of a Structural Adjustment under (and as defined in) the
Senior Facilities Agreement to the extent it does not confer an ability to make more extensive changes than a

consent, vote, approval or other action under, or in connection with, the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement

of the Senior Unsecured Only Security Documents which shall be binding on each party.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph immediately below, if the amendment, waiver or consent may impose new or
additional obligations on, or withdraw or reduce the rights of, any party other than:

Counterparty.

Neither of the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply:

    - to any release of transaction security, Senior Unsecured Only Security, claim or liabilities; or

    - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—
_Proceeds of Disposals” above._

###### 218


-----

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, a request to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, a
request to approve any action or a request for a confirmation or notification, in each case, under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Primary Creditor fails to respond to the request within 10 business days or fails to

participation or outstandings in respect of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation
or notification, as applicable.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
overrides anything in the Debt Documents or the Senior Unsecured Only Security Documents to the contrary.

_Other Provisions_

The Intercreditor Agreement contains further provisions customary for documents of this nature,
dealing with among other things:

(i) close-out and enforcement (and other enforcement) rights for the Hedge Counterparties
(certain required close-out obligations) and the terms on which the hedging agreements
must be entered into (and may be amended in the future) and on which payments may be
made under such hedging agreements;

(ii) restrictions on amendments to the terms of any Second Lien Liabilities, Senior Unsecured
Liabilities, Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities and Investor Liabilities, restrictions on
payments thereunder, restrictions on the taking of enforcement action by the related
creditors and similar customary provisions;

(iii) information sharing between creditor groups;

(iv) customary protection for trustees and the Security Agent; and

(v) customary provisions regarding assignments and transfers, and accession of future creditors,
HoldCo, Senior Unsecured Security Providers and Debtors.

_Governing Law_

The Intercreditor Agreement (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with
it) are governed by English law.

Shareholder Loans

In 2015, 2018 and 2019, LuxCo 3 as lender and TopCo as borrower entered into three shareholder
loans (the “Shareholder Loans”). The Shareholder Loans are subordinated to all obligations of TopCo. The
Shareholder Loans entered into in 2018 and 2019 mature after the maturity date of the Notes and we intend to
amend the Shareholder Loan entered into 2015 in order that it matures after the maturity date of the Notes. No
cash payments are required to service the Shareholder Loans.

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” under the heading “—Certain Definitions”. For the purposes of this “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes”, references to the “Issuer” refer to Douglas GmbH only and not to any of its Subsidiaries._

The Issuer will issue €1,305 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2026
(the “Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Senior Secured Notes
_Indenture”), among, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”),_
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”), paying agent (the “Paying Agent”)
and transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar (the “Registrar”)
and transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under, or be
subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because
they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

The proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the
Issuer, together with the proceeds of the offering of the Senior PIK Notes, amounts borrowed under the Senior
Credit Facilities and the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the redemption of the Existing Senior Secured Notes
and Existing Senior Notes; (ii) repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities; and
(iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under
the caption “Use of Proceeds”.

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of
the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by Kirk Beauty Two GmbH (the “Company”), Kirk Beauty
One GmbH (the “Parent”), Kirk Beauty Netherlands B.V., Parfümerie Douglas International GmbH, Parfümerie
Douglas GmbH, Douglas Finance B.V. and Douglas Einkaufs- und Servicegesellschaft mbH & Co. KG. (the
“Issue Date Guarantors”). The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) that on or prior to the date falling (a) on the later of the date on which such entity provides a
guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on
which such entity provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as
applicable, certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will become a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
guarantee the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis (the “Post-Closing Guarantors” and together with the
Issue Date Guarantors, the “Guarantors”).

The aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes issued in this offering will be €1,305 million.
We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes from time to time after this
offering having identical terms and conditions as the Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured
_Notes”). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants_
contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, respectively). Except_
with respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and except as otherwise provided in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Senior
Secured Notes subsequently issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. If the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not
fungible with the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with separate ISIN codes or common codes, as applicable.
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”, references to the
“Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are
actually issued.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of Indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the
Indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain Indebtedness,
turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the
Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description
of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

###### 220

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Brief Description of the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees

_The Senior Secured Notes_

The Senior Secured Notes will:

    - be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including
Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes,
to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

    - be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors as of the Issue Date and required to be guaranteed
by the Post-Closing Guarantors, as described under “—Note Guarantees”;

    - be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and obligations of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors; and

    - mature on April 8, 2026.

The Senior Secured Notes will be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in
global registered form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

Following the Closing Date, the Issuer intends to merge with the Company and the Parent, pursuant to
which the Company will be the surviving entity and will acquire all of the rights and assets, and will assume all
of the obligations, of the Issuer, including all rights and obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. See “The
_Transactions—Post-Closing Reorganization”._

_The Senior Secured Note Guarantees_

The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors on the Issue Date. The
Issuer intends to merge with the Company and the Parent following the Issue Date, pursuant to which the
Company will be the surviving entity and will acquire all of the rights and assets, and will assume all of the
obligations, of the Parent and the Issuer. Upon the completion of these mergers, the Note Guarantees of the
Company and the Parent and all intercompany loans between these entities will be extinguished. As a result,
the Company will become the successor Issuer of the Senior Secured Notes and will assume all of the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes. There is no requirement for us to complete the PostClosing Reorganization and failure to do so will not be an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also require the
Issuer to cause, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event on or prior to the date falling (a) on the later
of the date on which the relevant Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities
and 30 days after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which the relevant Post-Closing Guarantor
provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the PostClosing Guarantors to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes as described below. In addition, if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries
may provide a Note Guarantee in the future.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

    - be a general, joint and several, senior obligation of that Guarantor;

###### 221


-----

    - be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including that
Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and in the case of the Senior PIK
Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior PIK Notes;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including that Guarantor’s
Guarantee of the Senior PIK Notes; and

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure its Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantees to
reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests”. By virtue of these limitations, a_
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—The insolvency laws of Germany
_and the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of the Guarantors may not be as favorable to you as the U.S._
_bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.”_

_General_

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption
“—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”, the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain Subsidiaries of
the Company as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. None of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries and no future Unrestricted Subsidiary will guarantee the
Senior Secured Notes.

All of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will
depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Any right of the Issuer or
any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders of Senior Secured Notes to
participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s Indebtedness
and other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations, if any), except to the
extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in
which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively
subordinated to any obligations secured over the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and subordinated in
right of payment to any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to the claims held by the
Issuer or such Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Structure—The Issuers are dependent upon
_cash flow from subsidiaries to meet their obligations on the Notes and the Note Guarantees.” For the twelve-_
month period ended December 31, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (who is also a Guarantor of the
Senior PIK Notes) together with the Guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes (excluding the Company, which is
a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business
operations, material assets (other than the shares it owns in its subsidiaries and intragroup receivables) or
liabilities (other than intragroup liabilities that will be extinguished following completion of the Post-Closing
Mergers)) accounted for 37.3% of the consolidated total assets 48.5% of the consolidated sales and 50.0% of
the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as reported) of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

Principal and Maturity

The Issuer will issue €1,305 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes on the
Issue Date. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on April 8, 2026. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of 6.000% per annum. Interest on the
Senior Secured Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

###### 222


-----

    - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on
October 15, 2021, except for the final interest payment on the Maturity Date;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding each interest payment date; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the
aggregate principal amount outstanding.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Senior Secured Notes are subject to
the applicable procedures of the common depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is
due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined
below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such
payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by
a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, as applicable, will be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents
maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the
option of the Issuer, by wire transfer to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of
Senior Secured Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior
_Secured Notes”._

Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes. The initial Paying
Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar, the Paying
Agent and Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured
Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Senior
Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes
without prior notice to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes. However, for so long as Senior Secured Notes are
listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) and if and to
the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

Transfer and Exchange

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as
follows:

    - Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

    - Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

###### 223


-----

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
“Notice to Investors”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures
and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

During the 40-day distribution compliance period (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation
S), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law
of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such
transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in each case upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law,
be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to,
among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information
regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer
or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such
transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date with
respect to such Senior Secured Notes; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

###### 224


-----

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holders of Senior Secured Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

For the purposes of the applicable securities depositories, the denomination of the Senior Secured
Notes should be considered as €1,000, and Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce
the minimum denomination or tradeable amount of €100,000.

Note Guarantees

_General_

B.V., Parfümerie Douglas International GmbH, Parfümerie Douglas GmbH, Douglas Finance B.V. and Douglas

_Releases of Note Guarantees_

The Note Guarantee of any Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged:

    - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a Holding Company) or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described below “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock” and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a_
result of the sale or other disposition;

    - upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

    - as described in the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees”;_

    - as described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors”;

    - upon the release of the Guarantee and any other of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of
the relevant Note Guarantee under the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees” so long as no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other_
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor at that time is Guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

    - if such Guarantor is subject to or part of a Permitted Transaction; or

    - upon redemption of all of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by
(and at the expense of) the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications, including the delivery of a customary Officer’s
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion

of Counsel absolutely and without further enquiry. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

Security

_General_

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over the
following assets:

    - the issued share capital of the Issuer, the Parent and the Company;

    - certain intercompany receivables owed by each of the Issuer, the Parent and the Company to their
direct parent companies;

    - the bank accounts of the Issuer, the Parent and the Company; and

    - the proceeds loan under which the proceeds of the Senior PIK Notes are on-lent to the Company.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also require the
Issuer to cause, on or prior to the date falling on the later of the date on which any such Collateral secures the
Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date (in respect of Post-Closing Guarantors incorporated in
Germany or the Netherlands) or on the later of the date on which such Collateral secures the Senior Credit
Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date (in respect of Post-Closing Guarantors incorporated in Poland and
the pledges over the shares of Groupe Douglas France SAS and Douglas Italia SpA), the Senior Secured Notes
to be secured by first-priority security interests over the shares of each of the Post-Closing Guarantors, material
bank accounts of each of the Post-Closing Guarantors and material intercompany receivables owed by each of
the Post-Closing Guarantors.

In connection with the Post-Closing Reorganization, certain of the collateral will be released and new
security will be granted to give effect to the new structure. In particular, as part of the Post-Closing
Reorganization, KB A, a German company to be formed following the Issue Date in connection with the PostClosing Reorganization that will initially be the direct subsidiary of KBI, will replace KBI as the new direct parent
of the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and the Company and subsequently, that the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will replace
KB A as the new direct parent of the Company. In connection with such steps, KB A will assume the obligations
of the Company under certain shareholder loans and consequently, the security granted over the related
receivable in favor of the Senior Secured Notes will be released.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the
Collateral (including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement). Any additional security interests that
may in the future be pledged to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees
would also constitute Collateral.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Company and_
its Restricted Subsidiaries and the Senior PIK Notes Issuer will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral
in connection with certain future issuances of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests”._

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders of Senior Secured Notes and the creditors of other obligations secured thereby. No appraisals of
any Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Security Agent or the Trustee in
connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be
sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The collateral may not be
_sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.”_

###### 226


-----

_Priority_

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the
Security Documents (the “Security Interests”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
(b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Agreements, (c) the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
(d) the trustee, security agent and holders of the Senior PIK Notes under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and
(e) certain other credit representatives, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes are secured by a security interest on a first-priority basis in the Collateral. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the
Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. In particular, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement will, permit (i) Super Senior State Supported Debt in an aggregate amount
not to exceed €100 million and (ii) upon the first date on which the Senior Facilities Agreement has been fully
and finally discharged, the Incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to a super priority revolving credit facility
agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of €200 million and 50% of Consolidated
EBITDA as well as in respect of certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Agreements. If Incurred,
any liabilities in respect of obligations under such super priority credit facility agreement and such Hedging
Obligations and Cash Management Agreements would receive priority with respect to any proceeds received
from the enforcement of the Collateral or certain distressed disposals. Any proceeds received upon any such
enforcement would, after all obligations under such super priority credit facility have been repaid and such
Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Agreements have been discharged in full, be applied pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any other Indebtedness that is secured by
the Collateral on a pari passu basis. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Certain debt that we incur in
_the future may be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes in_
_priority to the Senior Secured Notes.”_

_Security Documents_

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to
secure the payment when due of, among others, the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security
Documents have been or will be entered into by, among others as the case may be, the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents,
the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including the Trustee and
the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of the Senior PIK
Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Agreements in
relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, as
applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral. However, the Security Interests with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances as
provided under “—Release of Liens” below. See “—Enforcement of Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to our Structure—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which_
_the collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent_
_or the consent of the relevant Trustee”. The validity and enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to,_
_inter alios, the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests”._

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to
enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may
only act through the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence
governing the creation and perfection of security interests in certain jurisdictions, the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security
interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Indebtedness under the Senior Secured
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the other secured obligations arising in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The security interests in the collateral will be granted to the Security
_Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes and certain collateral will be granted subsequent to the_

###### 227


-----

_issuance of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the collateral may be restricted by_
_local law.”_

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes
might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Notes—It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes.”_

Subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any security provider
will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and
dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash
payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Security Documents; Agreement to be Bound_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by
accepting such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” (including,
without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Collateral and
authorizing the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents on its behalf), as the
same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms;

(2) authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform their
respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance
therewith; and

(3) have appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements”._

_Release of Liens_

The Issuer, the Guarantors and any security provider will be entitled to release Security Interests in
respect of the Collateral owned by it or by any such Guarantor under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than Security Interests in
respect any of the Capital Stock of the Company (the “Company Share Collateral”)) to (a) a
Person that is not the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction
subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor;_
_provided that nothing in this clause (1) shall restrict the release of Security Interests in respect_
of the Company Share Collateral (x) to the extent that substantially concurrently with such
release, Liens over the Company Share Collateral having equivalent ranking as prior to such
release are granted for the benefit of the Holders, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
on substantially the same terms as the initial Security Interest or (y) in connection with the
Post-Closing Reorganization.

(2) other than in respect of Company Share Collateral, in the case of a Guarantor that is released
from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

###### 228


-----

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured
Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release
of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include
Collateral, or the sale of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, pursuant to a
Factoring Transaction;

(8) as permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” (or, in the case of the Company Share Collateral, that would be permitted by such_
covenant were it to apply to the security providers of such Company Share Collateral); or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(10) if required to effect a Permitted Transaction; or

(11) upon redemption of all of the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, the Security Interests in respect of the entire Capital Stock of the Company, the Parent
and/or the Issuer, as applicable, shall be permitted to be released within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial
Public Offering in which any of the Company, the Parent or the Issuer is the IPO Entity; provided that no
Security Interests over the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of the IPO Entity may be released in
reliance on this provision and provided further that such Security Interests so released shall be promptly
granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in the event that the Initial Public Offering is abandoned or does
not complete for any reason.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (to the extent action is required by it in order to effectuate such
release) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent
without the consent of the Holders of Senior Secured Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release).

IPO Debt Pushdown

On or following an Initial Public Offering (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of Collateral if required to implement such IPO Event), the Issuer shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown
_Date”)) on the basis that:_

(1) references to the Issuer, the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions)
shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(2) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any
parent entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the
level of the IPO Pushdown Entity;

(3) each reference in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the Issuer shall be deemed to be a reference to the
IPO Pushdown Entity (subject to the third paragraph of this section “—IPO Debt Pushdown”
and to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and provided that
nothing in this paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause
(3) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the
Issuer, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any

###### 229


-----

representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or other term in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the other collateral documents or a Default or an Event of Default;

(4) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as
applicable, in the Senior Secured Notes Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO
Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes or otherwise);

(5) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking,
covenant or other term in the Senior Secured Notes Documents or a Default or an Event of
Default;

(6) the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes will be (and will be deemed to
have been) novated or otherwise transferred to the IPO Pushdown Entity (or, subject to the
third paragraph of this section “—IPO Debt Pushdown” below, to the Restricted Subsidiary of
the IPO Pushdown Entity set forth therein); provided that such member of the Pushdown
Group is incorporated in the same jurisdiction as the Issuer;

(7) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations and restrictions under the Senior Secured Notes Documents
and any security granted by any such Parent Entity;

(8) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity that had been party to the Senior Secured
Notes Documents, and each Subsidiary of such Parent Entity that is not the IPO Pushdown
Entity or a Subsidiary thereof, will not, on the Pushdown Date after giving pro forma effect
thereto, have any assets (other than shares in its subsidiaries and intercompany receivables)
that are material to, or reasonably necessary for the operation of, the business of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(9) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “HoldCo” or “Investor” (as such
terms are defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (each in such capacity, a “Released
_Person”) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement_
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date
specified by the Issuer, that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in the applicable capacity as a Released Person and
shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in that capacity); and (B) there shall be no obligation or
requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Released
Person; and

(10) in the event that any Person is released from or ceases to be or become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Released Person as
a consequence of this paragraph, any term of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or
assumes that any Person be a Released Person or that any liabilities or obligations to such
Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall, at the request of the Issuer
and without the consent of Holders, enter into any amendment or supplement to, release of, or replacement of,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Documents required by the
Issuer and/or take such other action as is requested by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the
matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant (collectively, an “IPO Pushdown”); provided, that
such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument will not impose any personal obligations on
the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto or adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee, the Security Agent or any other agents party thereto
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or Security Documents. The Trustee, the
Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (without any consent by the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to
execute any such amended, released or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the
Holders (and shall do so on the request of the Issuer).

###### 230


-----

For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company or a Parent Entity of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the Person to be
treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the IPO Pushdown
Entity shall be the entity that will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (such
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or a Parent Entity of the Company, the “Listed Entity”) and provided
_further that if the Senior PIK Notes or any other Senior Unsecured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor_
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement) are not refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date,
clauses (1) through (10) above shall operate such that:

(i) either the Listed Entity shall become the Senior PIK Notes Issuer (or the SUN Borrower/Issuer
as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or a direct subsidiary of the Listed Entity specified
by the Company in the Pushdown Notice shall become the Senior PIK Notes Issuer (or the
SUN Borrower/Issuer as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement); and

(ii) all references to the Pushdown Entity in clauses (1) through (10) above other than clauses (4),
(5) and (7), which shall refer to the Listed Entity) shall be construed as references to the direct
Restricted Subsidiary of the Listed Entity (which is not the Senior PIK Notes Issuer or SUN
Borrower/Issuer as determined by the first paragraph of this paragraph) (and for the purposes
of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured
Finance Documents and the Second Lien Finance Documents the Group (each as defined
therein) shall be defined as such direct Restricted Subsidiary of the Listed Entity and its
Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time and for the purposes of the Senior Unsecured
Finance Documents, the Group (or Restricted Group or equivalent term) shall be defined as
the Listed Entity and its restricted subsidiaries including the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and SUN
Borrower/Issuer).

If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to
the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown
Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (i) the provisions of clauses (1) to (10) of the first
paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any Collateral has
been released pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and in accordance with the section “Security—Release of Liens” above, the provider
of any Company Share Collateral, Company, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary will as soon as
reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that Collateral; and (iii) if any
Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity of a Released Person has been released from the
Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to clauses (9) or (10) of the first paragraph or the third paragraph of this
covenant in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement as the applicable Released Person. For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this
paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to
any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be
deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or
other term in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a Default or an Event of
Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or
committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2023 the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional
Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate

redemption price of 106.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date); provided that:

Senior Secured Notes Indenture (excluding any Additional Senior Secured Notes) remains
outstanding immediately after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2023 the Issuer may, during each calendar year,
redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to
103.000% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2023 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to
time, a part of any Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof
plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

_General_

We may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the
optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders
whose Senior Secured Notes are subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes, including a Change of Control Offer
or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and
the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of the Senior
Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the
right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such
purchase date, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee)
in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to
any provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regarding Senior Secured Notes deemed not to be
outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at
least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes have validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Senior Secured Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds
controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to
the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of
Control, and Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion,
be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related
transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the

###### 232


-----

redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the
notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by
the Issuer in their sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in
their sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so
delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines
that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer may redeem Senior Secured Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to
redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made
pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates.

Sinking Fund

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

Selection and Notice

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes is to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream
will credit their respective participants’ accounts in compliance with their existing requirements and practices,
or if the Senior Secured Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream
prescribes no method of selection, selection will be made on a pro rata basis by way of pool factor (or, in the
case of Senior Secured Notes issued in global form as discussed under “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”,
based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection); provided, however, that no such partial
redemption shall reduce the outstanding aggregate principal amount of any Senior Secured Note not
redeemed to less than €100,000. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any
selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes
to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance
with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be
delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a legal or covenant defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any
change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Secured Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date,
interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

If the due date for any redemption payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is not a business
day in the place of payment (or from where the payment will be made), payment shall be made on the next
succeeding day that is a business day and no interest shall accrue in the intervening period.

Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (with a copy to the
Trustee and the Paying Agents) (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the

###### 233


-----

principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a
“Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption_
or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or revenue guidance) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in
Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to
make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person,
after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a change
or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing to the effect that the Payor (as defined below) has been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on
such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Withholding Taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such
Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is
made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax, by or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note, including payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of
such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in

###### 234


-----

respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being
resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from
the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to
the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding is payable),
to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality,
residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is
required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent
the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the
Senior Secured Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after
the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on
behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by
presenting the relevant Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from,
another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(7) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or
any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner
would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner
held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the
full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in
accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts
to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of
such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will
attach to each certified copy a certificate or other reasonable evidence stating that the amount of withholding
Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount
of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

###### 235


-----

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on
any Senior Secured Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor
will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts
will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to
pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the
payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on
such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the
Senior Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Note
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holders, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent
and the Registrar for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar
charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property
or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that
arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or receipt of
payments with respect to, any Senior Secured Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer
of the Senior Secured Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges
or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Senior Secured Notes, to any
such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
organized engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from
or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes is made by or on behalf of
such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Change of Control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“Change of Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to
€100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, provided that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or
less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
_however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any Senior Secured Notes as described under this_
heading “Change of Control”, in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to
redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes and
given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption
have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will
send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control
Offer, as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee) who will send such notice to each Holder of any Senior Secured
Notes:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right
to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a

###### 236


-----

purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest
on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the
Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not
tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes
repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as
applicable, an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior
Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being
purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer;
and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent or tender agent for such
Change of Control Offer, as applicable, will promptly mail or deliver to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note
equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any;
_provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and_
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and
to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of
Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior
Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s
right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change
of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that
would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the

###### 237


-----

requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given under
“—Optional Redemption” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned
upon the consummation of such Change of Control.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Section 14(e) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The
Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not
recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would
require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain
events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory
prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of
certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon
a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the
Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing
financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make
any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise
_the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events_
_constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of control provision contained in_
_each Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as
to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified
with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

Certain Covenants

_Limitation on Indebtedness_

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness;
_provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of_
such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof),
for the most recently ended Relevant Period, (1) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (y) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.5 to 1.0; (2) to the extent
that the Indebtedness is Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.5 to 1.0 and (3) to the extent that
the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 4.25 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit
or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in

###### 238


-----

respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (a) €800 million, plus (b) the greater
of (i) €300 million and (ii) 75% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (c) in the case of any refinancing
of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred by another provision of this covenant; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”, Indebtedness
arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing
Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary that is
not a Guarantor (except in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the
ordinary course of business in connection with cash management positions of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness shall be unsecured and
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all
obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Company, or
the applicable Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor to the extent required by
the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (y) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of
the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the
Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in
one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of
this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall
be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and
not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in

are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the
first or second paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) “Consolidated EBITDA” shall be calculated in accordance with the section “Certain
_Covenants—Financial Calculations” set forth below;_

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof
will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue
Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (28) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any ratios or baskets or
other applicable provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture for borrowings and
reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the Issuer’s option (A) on the date
of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B) on the
date on which such facility or commitments become available (assuming, in the case of
(A) and (B) of this clause (9) that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) and, in either case, if any such ratio or
basket or other applicable provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with
respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and

###### 242


-----

creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this
covenant irrespective of any such ratio, basket, provision of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be
borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (9) but not actually borrowed
on such date shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of any clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses); and

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this
covenant or any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA as of any date of determination, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of determination of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate
amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs,
indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;
provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in
the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest,
accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and
such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket,
permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred. Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if
such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred or at the Issuer’s discretion, first committed or first Incurred or upon execution of the definitive
documentation in respect thereof; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded
so long as the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock)
of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of
Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency
Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being

###### 243


-----

refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
the second paragraph of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
and/or (iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing
on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner
that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on any relevant
date of determination of such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment.
The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any
non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

For the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBITDA,” pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
in a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or
otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the Company’s
Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to
Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect”
action by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

_Limitation on Liens_

The Company will not and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest
therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial
_Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or_
(2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is
so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) above will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien
to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or
with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed
to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior
Facilities Agreement), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or (c) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or
relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date
on which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with
or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument
is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide
all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired
by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction)
and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another
Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be
deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such
Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement
or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial
_Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an_
agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided,
_however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary_
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect
to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement
or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the
assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Senior Secured Notes

Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the
property or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security
agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized
Lease Obligations permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, that
impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired, or any encumbrance or
restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution
or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property
or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing
of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar
agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to
any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement, together with
the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case,
as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or where the Issuer
determines that such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect, in any material
respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured
Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with Factoring Financing;

_on Liens”;_

those relating to non-wholly owned Subsidiaries.

_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the
Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

###### 251


-----

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in
excess of the greater of €40 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, at least 75% of the
consideration the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset
Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Available Cash received from the conversion within 180 days
of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Company’s or
such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since
the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance
sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the
Company nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such
liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Company and each other
Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a
result of such Asset Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second
paragraph of this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor received
from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the
extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Company or the
applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or
such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at
any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €25 million and 6.5% of
Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause
(2).

If the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available
Cash of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described in clause (8) below)
of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, may be used by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary
tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness Incurred
under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; (ii) unless included in the_
preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market
purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) Pari
Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is not subordinated to the
Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes at a price of no more than 100% of the principal
amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the Issuer shall prepay,
repay, purchase or redeem Public Debt (other than the Senior Secured Notes) pursuant to
this clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an
offer to Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set
forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of

###### 252


-----

such Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Notes); or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor
or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case
other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor or Indebtedness
owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and, for the avoidance of doubt, other
than the Senior Secured Credit Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement));

(2) purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and/or redeem Notes pursuant to the
redemption provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or by making an Asset
Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (in accordance with the
procedures set out below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is
or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3),
(4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that, a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the
date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is
consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day
period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The following amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes
“Excess Proceeds”:

(1) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash is
greater than 4.0 to 1.0, 100% of such Net Available Cash; and

(2) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as at the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash is
equal to or less than 4.0 to 1.0, 50% of such Net Available Cash;

_provided that if immediately prior to making an Asset Disposition Offer, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net_
Leverage Ratio falls into a lower threshold than at the time initially calculated, then the relevant percentage of
Net Available Cash that constitute Excess Cash Proceeds shall be reduced accordingly.

Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce
indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in
clause (8) above has been entered into) or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €40 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be
required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no
more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari
Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of

###### 253

purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Senior Secured Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds
shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on
a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into
their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are
denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received
by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified
with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior
Secured Notes.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No
later than ten Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
_Purchase Date”), the Issuer will repay the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects,_
Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all_
Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer
in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly
(but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or
deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer
will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such
new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior
Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer
to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S.
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

of the greater of €20 million and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be

agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€40 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of

and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements in respect of the most

-----

the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or
director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a
description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act
for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the U.S. Exchange Act by persons
who are not “affiliates” under the U.S. Securities Act.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that
the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or
statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that material differences exist between the results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer
and the Company, the annual and quarterly reports shall give a reasonably detailed description of such
differences. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s (a) total consolidated
revenue or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial
reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent
quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were restricted)
constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations
of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer may at any time elect to become the reporting entity in place of the
Company, after which election, references to the “Company” in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be deemed
to refer to the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).
Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company and the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Subject to compliance with the next paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company, the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ,
the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the
European Union) and the Company, the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission
and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the New
York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European
Union), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Company, the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in
a Member State of the European Union) pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards (or the

###### 259

applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ,
the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the
European Union, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such
requirements require the Company, the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one
or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the New York Stock
Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, as
applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company
so long as such reports (if an annual, half-yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to
content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to such
Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information that explains in reasonable detail
the differences between, to the extent applicable: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not the Company or
Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total
consolidated amounts; or (y) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company that represents substantially all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (the
“Reporting Subsidiary”) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company
therein were references to the Reporting Subsidiary and (b) include condensed consolidated financial
information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between, to the extent applicable,: (i) the
Company; (ii) the Reporting Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other
Subsidiaries of the Company that are not the Reporting Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Reporting Subsidiary
on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying
with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Company will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant will be made in the English language.

_Merger and Consolidation_

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United
Kingdom, any member state of the European Union, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Australia or any state thereof,
Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume,
(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that
becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company
or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Fixed Charge Coverage for
the Company or the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be at least 2.0
to 1.0 or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company or the Successor Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended Relevant Period immediately
preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

###### 260


-----

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee (and the Trustee will be able to rely without
further inquiry on) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that
such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a
legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company in
accordance with its terms (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any
such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect
thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness”._

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties
and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially
all its assets, the Issuer will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
“—Merger and Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset
Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the
surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets
of such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor (with its Note Guarantee subject to limitation as set forth in the
Agreed Security Principles) substantially concurrently with such consolidation,
merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) [reserved];

(c) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the surviving entity or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Note Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee and with its Note Guarantee subject to limitation as set forth in the
Agreed Security Principles); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction,
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

###### 261


-----

(d) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clauses (a) and (c)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference or thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, including in each case the views,
guidance or interpretation of the relevant regulator; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with
respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all
or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of
its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule,
regulation or order, recommendation or direction of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Company and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the
Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation,
the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction;
(v) the solvent liquidation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (vi) the Issuer or any Guarantor
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of such entity or (vii) the Post-Closing Reorganization; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and
(4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to any such transaction in respect of the Issuer.

_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have
Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective
and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default

###### 262


-----

or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in
effect since the date of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension
Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will
be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause
(4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Company or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any
date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured
Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set
forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that, no such notification shall be a
condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no
assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

_Impairment of Security Interest_

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall not and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the
covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Limitation on Liens”, including Permitted
Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred and released and retaken, if applicable, in
accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement

Subject to the foregoing, the applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released and retaken from time to time to (1) cure
any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (2) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens,
(3) add to the Collateral, (4) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect, or (5) for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Transaction or the Post-Closing
Reorganization; provided, however, that in the case of clause (4) above, the Security Documents may not be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either
(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the relevant Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors, Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Executive Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security
Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications
customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, release, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

_Additional Guarantees_

The Company shall cause, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, as soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Issue Date and in any event on or prior to the date falling (a) on the later of the date on
which such Post Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days after the

###### 263


-----

Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which such Post Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the
Senior Credit Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, each Post Closing Guarantor to:

(1) execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary will provide a Note
Guarantee, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu (subject to the super senior
ranking of “Super Senior Lender Liabilities”, as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement or pursuant to a corresponding definition in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) with all other Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary; and

(2) accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company will not cause or permit any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities, any Credit Facility (in an aggregate amount of all such Guarantees of such other Credit Facilities
exceeding €50 million outstanding) or any other Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless
such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the
Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
providing for a Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari
_passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such_
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result
in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference or thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, guidance and coordination
rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or
liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer,
any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to
recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financials assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law. This paragraph shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not Incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Releases of
_Note Guarantees”. A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at_
the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred
after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not
designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors”.

_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer and without the
consent of Holders, in connection with the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any
(1) Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the Company, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor_
Agreement on substantially the same terms (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of
the Security Interest; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement or restatement, amendment or
modification of the Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security

-----

Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without
the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking pari passu
or junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any
other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect
their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that
such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured
Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter
into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business
Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Issuer or at the offices of the listing agent.

_Financial Calculations_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this section.
Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated with reference to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for
purposes of calculating compliance with any covenant determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA.

For the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or
compliance with any covenant determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA, for a Specified Transaction
(and the Incurrence or repayment of any Indebtedness in connection therewith) that has been made (i) during
the applicable Relevant Period or (ii) subsequent to such Relevant Period and prior to or simultaneously with
the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming
that all such Specified Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated EBITDA and the component
financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of the
applicable Relevant Period. If since the beginning of any applicable Relevant Period any Person that
subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into any
Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such Relevant Period shall have made any Specified Transaction
that would have required adjustment pursuant to this section, then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in
accordance with this section.

###### 265


-----

Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall
be made in good faith by an Officer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run rate” cost
savings, operating expense reductions and synergies (excluding revenue synergies) projected by the Issuer in
good faith to be realized as a result of specified actions taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken
(calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies had
been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and
synergies were realized during the entirety of such period) relating to such Specified Transaction and run rate
means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken, committed to be taken or
with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken, net of the amount of
actual benefits realized during such period from such actions; provided that (i) such amounts are reasonably
identifiable, quantifiable and factually supportable in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, (ii) such actions are
taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of such Specified
Transaction and (iii) no amounts shall be added pursuant to this paragraph to the extent duplicative of any
amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA, whether through a pro forma
adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period; provided that any such adjustments made under this
paragraph, together with any “run rate” adjustments under clause (13) of the definition of Consolidated
EBITDA, shall not exceed 20% of Consolidated EBITDA after giving effect to all other adjustments permitted by
the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”; provided, further, that at the election of the Issuer (in its sole and
absolute discretion), such amounts shall not be required to be determined for any Specified Transaction to the
extent the aggregate consideration paid in connection with such Specified Transaction was equal to or less
than €25 million.

In the event that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs (including by assumption or
guarantees) or repays (including by repurchase, redemption, repayment, retirement, defeasance,
extinguishment or other discharge) any Indebtedness included in the calculations of the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as the case may be (in each case, other than Indebtedness Incurred
or repaid under any revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business for working capital purposes),
(i) during the applicable Relevant Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Relevant Period and
prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect
to such Incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the
last day of the applicable Relevant Period with the change in any associated Fixed Charges being calculated as
if such Incurrence or repayment occurred on the first day of such Relevant Period; provided that (A) such pro
_forma calculation shall not give effect to (x) any Indebtedness Incurred on the date on which the event for which_
the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”) pursuant to the
provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or
(y) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the
proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and (B) the cash proceeds (and any resulting cash and Cash Equivalent_
Investments) of such Incurred Indebtedness shall be excluded from amounts that may be netted in the
calculation of pro forma Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, pro forma Consolidated Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or pro forma Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate
of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the
rate in effect on the date such calculation is being made had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Swap Contract applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease
Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by an Officer to be the rate of
interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with the relevant Accounting Principles. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit
facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a LIBOR interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall
be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate
chosen as the Issuer may designate.

With respect to any basket or threshold that is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated at all times as if
Capitalized Lease Obligations are calculated on the basis of IFRS as in effect prior to January 1, 2019,
irrespective of whether an IFRS 16 Election has been made.

On and after the date pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition or Investment and on which the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is Incurring Indebtedness, which acquisition or Investment has yet to be
consummated but for which a definitive agreement governing such acquisition or Investment has been
executed and remains in effect, such pro forma effect shall be deemed to continue at all times thereafter for

###### 266


-----

purposes of determining ratio-based conditions and baskets until the earlier of the date such acquisition or
Investment is consummated or the date such definitive agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation.

Without prejudice to the rights of the Restricted Group under the foregoing paragraphs:

(a) for the purposes of the determination of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the exchange rates used in the calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA shall be the weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period
as determined by the Issuer; and

(b) for the purposes of the determination of Consolidated Total Debt, Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Debt and Consolidated Total Net Debt in respect of any period, the exchange
rates used for the determination of Consolidated Total Debt, Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Debt and Consolidated Total Net Debt for that relevant period shall be (A) in relation to
Indebtedness for which the Restricted Group has entered into cross currency swaps, the rate
at which such swap has been entered into and (B) in relation to all other Indebtedness, the
exchange rate used in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA or calculated in accordance
with paragraph (i) above.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture require (i) compliance with any financial ratio or test, any Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio test, any Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test, any Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio
test or any Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test and/or any threshold expressed as a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA in connection with the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Equity Interests, the
creation of Liens, the making of any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted
Payment, the designation of a Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the
repayment of Indebtedness or Disqualified Equity Interests, (ii) the absence of a Default or Event of Default (or
any type of Default or Event of Default) as a condition or (iii) satisfaction of all other conditions precedent to the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Equity Interests, the creation of Liens, the making of
any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment, the designation of a
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the repayment of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Equity Interests, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, the
determination of such ratio or other provisions, determination of whether any Default or Event of Default has
occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom or the satisfaction of any other conditions shall, at the
election of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition
Transaction, an “LCT Election”, which LCT Election may be in respect of one or more of paragraphs (i), (ii) and
(iii) above), be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements (or other relevant definitive documentation)
for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”). If on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness or Disqualified Equity Interests and the use of
proceeds thereof), with such ratios and other provisions calculated as if such Limited Condition Transaction or
other transactions had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Relevant Period ending prior to the LCT
Test Date, the Issuer could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the
applicable ratios or other provisions, such provisions shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the
avoidance of doubt, if any of such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the person subject to such acquisition or investment, at
or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratios will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the relevant transaction or
action is permitted to be consummated or taken; provided that if such ratios improve as a result of such
fluctuations, such improved ratios may be utilized. In connection with any action being taken in connection with
a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision which requires
that no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or
would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed
satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date
the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof)
is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted
under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or
amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

###### 267

Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured
Note issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice
by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Company, the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists,
or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment
default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €40 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Holdcos, the Company, the
Parent, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company, the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final
judgments aggregating in excess of €40 million other than any judgments covered by
indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy
companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of
€20 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and
any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of the Company, the Parent or a Significant Subsidiary (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to
any limitations)) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases to
be in full force and effect or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms
in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10
days.

However, a default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the

###### 268


-----

Senior Secured Notes Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6) the
Issuer does not cure such default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by written notice to the Issuer
and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is
continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration
of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of
the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with
respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict
with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the
Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity, security or
prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered and, if requested, the Trustee has received, the Trustee security,
prefunding or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request
and the offer of such security, prefunding or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default of which the
Trustee has actual knowledge has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes

###### 269


-----

Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification, security or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the
Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to
the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may (without liability for so
doing) withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further
inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the
signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30
days after any Officer of the Issuer becomes aware of any events which would constitute a Default, written
notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action
the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of
any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with
the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of this Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such
delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the
Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified, prefunded or secured to its satisfaction.
It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and,
accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of
an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with
any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). Without the consent of Holders holding not less
than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior
Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change
the time at which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described
above under “—Optional Redemption” and “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured
Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or
after the due dates therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under
“Withholding Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured
Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that
would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless
the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release any security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than
in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a
rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior
Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the
Issuer or any Guarantor under any Senior Secured Notes Document, including without
limitation, in connection with a Permitted Transaction;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change (including changing the ISIN, Common Code or other identifying number
on any Senior Secured Notes) that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee
or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of
the Holders in any material respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees, to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Senior_
Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm
and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof
with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security
Documents or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

-----

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of
a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for
the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the
Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent,
or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the
transfer and legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Senior Secured Notes;
provided, however, that (i) compliance with this Senior Secured Notes Indenture as so
amended would not result in Senior Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Secured Notes in any material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Merger and_
_Consolidation”, relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or_

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

In connection with such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely on an
Officer’s Certificate and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender
of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with,
“—Certain Covenants” or this “—Amendments and Waivers” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of
Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section “—Amendments and Waivers” to add a
Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture
providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer,
(ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent
(to the extent applicable).

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment
of a consent fee to Holders.

Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Company or by
any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with,
the Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that for the purposes of
determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only
Senior Secured Notes that a responsible officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so
disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a Person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company.

###### 272

Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults
and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the
rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in
connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of
Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration
provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment
default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of
_Default” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior
Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation”, (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events_
_of Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this
purpose) cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an
amount sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be, provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of
the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such
amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the
date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption and must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,
to the effect that Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred;

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be,
have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in
connection with either defeasance option.

Satisfaction and Discharge

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be

###### 273


-----

discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange
of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to all
outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated
and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured
Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the
Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent
in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), money or in euro
or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior
Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of this Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent that an amount
is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to
the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that
such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to
be paid all other sums payable under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered
irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Senior Secured
Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which the Trustee may rely on without further inquiry) each
to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been
complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent (or other entity directed, designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) will
distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case
may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the
Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance
of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above
will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such
amounts.

No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of
the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee
will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the
same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should
it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates.

###### 274


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be
removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any
time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may
resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires
a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent
or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not
less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for
any loss, liability, expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notices

If and for so long as Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be sent to
the Exchange. In addition, for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices
to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of
Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day
after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by firstclass mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given through
Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be
prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due
to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to
make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained
by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for
the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver
granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out
herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Note Guarantee of a
Senior Secured Note, or to the Trustee.

###### 275


-----

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

Listing

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application
to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior
Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on
obtaining this listing or permission.

Enforceability of Judgments

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

Consent to Jurisdiction and Service

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR PIK NOTES

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior PIK Notes”
under the heading “—Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Senior PIK Notes”, references
to the “Issuer” refer to Kirk Beauty SUN GmbH only and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue €475 million aggregate principal amount of Senior PIK Notes due 2026
(the “Senior PIK Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Senior PIK Notes Indenture”),
among, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”), paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) and transfer
agent (the “Transfer Agent”), and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar (the “Registrar”) and transfer
agent (the “Transfer Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act. The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will not be qualified under, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture
and the Senior PIK Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not
restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Senior PIK
Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define
your rights as Holders of the Senior PIK Notes.

The proceeds of the offering of the Senior PIK Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer,
together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, amounts borrowed under the Senior
Credit Facilities and the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the redemption of the Existing Senior Secured Notes
and Existing Senior Notes; (ii) repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities; and
(iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under
the caption “Use of Proceeds”.

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior PIK Notes, the Senior PIK Notes will be obligations of the Issuer
and will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by Kirk Beauty Two GmbH (the “Company”), Kirk Beauty
One GmbH (the “Parent”), Douglas GmbH (the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer”), Kirk Beauty Netherlands B.V.,
Parfümerie Douglas International GmbH, Parfümerie Douglas GmbH, Douglas Finance B.V. and Douglas
Einkaufs- und Servicegesellschaft mbH & Co. KG. (the “Issue Date Guarantors”). The Senior PIK Notes Indenture
will require (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) that on or prior to the date falling (a) on the later of the
date on which such entity provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days after the Issue Date
and (b) on the later of the date on which such entity provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and
90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries will become a party to the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture and guarantee the Senior PIK Notes on a senior subordinated basis (the “Post_Closing Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will require that on or prior to November 30,_
2021 and only if Post-Closing Reorganization has not been completed, either a newly-incorporated company
that will initially be the direct subsidiary of KBI (“KB A”) or KBI (together with KB A, the Issue Date Guarantors
and the Post-Closing Subsidiary Guarantors, the “Guarantors”), whichever is the direct parent company of the
Company, will become a party to the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and guarantee the Senior PIK Notes on a
senior basis.

The aggregate principal amount of Senior PIK Notes issued in this offering will be €475 million. We
may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior PIK Notes from time to time after this offering
having identical terms and conditions as the Senior PIK Notes (the “Additional Senior PIK Notes”). We will only
be permitted to issue Additional Senior PIK Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the covenant
restricting the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, respectively). Except with respect to right of payment and
optional redemption, and except as otherwise provided in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Senior PIK
Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Senior PIK Notes subsequently issued under the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture,
including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. If the
Additional Senior PIK Notes are not fungible with the Senior PIK Notes issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the Additional Senior PIK Notes will be issued with separate ISIN codes or common
codes, as applicable. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Senior PIK Notes”,
references to the “Senior PIK Notes” include the Senior PIK Notes and any Additional Senior PIK Notes that are
actually issued.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding
the relative ranking of Indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the Indebtedness,
the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain Indebtedness, turnover

obligations, release of security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of
certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The registered Holder of a Senior PIK Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

Brief Description of the Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees

_The Senior PIK Notes_

The Senior PIK Notes will:

    - be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior PIK Notes, including the Issuer’s
Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes and the Issuer’s Guarantee of the Senior Facilities
Agreement;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior PIK Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior PIK Notes or that
is secured on a first-priority basis over property and assets that secure the Senior PIK Notes on a
second-priority basis (including the Senior Secured Notes and Indebtedness Incurred under the
Senior Facilities Agreement), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness;

    - be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors as of the Issue Date and required to be guaranteed
by the Post-Closing Subsidiary Guarantors, as described under “—Note Guarantees”;

    - be guaranteed by KB A or KBI, if the Post-Closing Reorganization has not been completed on or
prior to November 30, 2021, as described under “—Note Guarantees”;

    - be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and obligations of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors; and

    - mature on October 1, 2026.

The Senior PIK Notes will be represented by one or more registered Senior PIK Notes in global
registered form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See “Book_Entry, Delivery and Form”._

Following the Closing Date, we intend that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer merges with the Company
and the Parent, pursuant to which the Company will be the surviving entity and will acquire all of the rights and
assets, and will assume all of the obligations, of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including all rights and
obligations under the Note Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “Post-Closing Mergers”).
Furthermore, we intend that KB A will become the direct parent of the Issuer and the Issuer will become the
direct parent of the Company on or before November 30, 2021. See “The Transactions—Post-Closing
_Reorganization”._

_The Note Guarantees_

The Senior PIK Notes will be guaranteed by Issue Date Guarantors on the Issue Date. Subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will also require the Issuer to cause as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event on or prior to the date falling (a) on the later of the date on which the
relevant Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days after the Issue
Date and (b) on the later of the date on which the relevant Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the
Senior Credit Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, the relevant Post-Closing Subsidiary
Guarantors to guarantee the Senior PIK Notes.

###### 313


-----

Upon the completion of Post-Closing Mergers, the Note Guarantees of the Company and the Parent
and all intercompany loans between these entities will be extinguished. As a result, the Company will become
the successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer will assume all of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
including all rights and obligations under the Note Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. There is no
requirement for us to complete the Post-Closing Mergers and failure to do so will not be an event of default
under the Senior PIK Notes and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

Following the completion of the Post-Closing Mergers, KBI intends to undertake the Post-Closing
Reorganization. On or prior to November 30, 2021 and only if the Post-Closing Reorganization has not been
completed, KB A or KBI, whichever is the direct parent company of the Company at such time, will guarantee
the Senior PIK Notes, in either case as described below.

In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”,
certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor (other than a Note Guarantee granted by KB A or KBI, if any)
will:

    - be a general, joint and several, senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor;

    - be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior Indebtedness of that
Guarantor, including that Guarantor’s guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes and Indebtedness
Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any future senior subordinated Indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure its Note Guarantee, or that is secured on a firstpriority basis over property and assets that secure such Note Guarantee on a second-priority basis
(including that Guarantors’ guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes and Indebtedness Incurred
under the Senior Facilities Agreement), to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such Indebtedness.

A Note Guarantee of either of KB A or KBI, if any, will:

    - be a general, joint and several, senior obligation of KB A and KBI;

    - be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any future Indebtedness of KB A and KBI that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of KB A and KBI that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of KB A and KBI that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure its Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantees
to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their
respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests”. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Senior PIK Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—The insolvency laws
_of Germany and the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of the Guarantors may not be as favorable to you as_
_the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.”_

###### 314


-----

_General_

As of the Issue Date, the Company and all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted
_Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described_
below under the caption “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”, the Issuer will be permitted to
designate before completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization certain Subsidiaries of the Company and after
completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization, certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. None
of the restrictive covenants in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries and no
future Unrestricted Subsidiary will guarantee the Senior PIK Notes.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will be a subsidiary of KBI and will have no material assets (other than
the Proceeds Loan) and no liabilities (other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the
Transaction). Following completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization, all of the operations of the Issuer will
be conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries
to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior PIK Notes.

Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior PIK Notes. Any right of the Issuer or
any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders of Senior PIK Notes to
participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s Indebtedness
and other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations, if any), except to the
extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in
which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively
subordinated to any obligations secured over the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and subordinated in
right of payment to any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to the claims held by the
Issuer or such Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Structure—The Issuers are dependent upon
_cash flow from subsidiaries to meet their obligations on the Notes and the Note Guarantees.” For the twelve-_
month period ended December 31, 2020, the Guarantors (excluding the Company, which is a holding
company with no revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations, material
assets (other than the shares it owns in its subsidiaries and intragroup receivables) or liabilities (other than
intragroup liabilities that will be extinguished following completion of the Post-Closing Mergers)) represented
37.3% of the consolidated total assets, 48.5% of the consolidated sales and 50.0% of the consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA (as reported) of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

Subordination on the Basis of the Intercreditor Agreement

The Note Guarantees (other than any Note Guarantee granted by KB A and KBI) are senior
subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, such Note Guarantees rank behind, and are expressly subordinated to, all the
existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors (other than KB A and KBI), including any obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes and any other indebtedness ranking pari
passu therewith incurred after the Issue Date. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors
(other than KB A) is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Note Guarantees
and the collateral securing the Senior PIK Notes and Note Guarantees are subject to release under certain
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to an
enforcement of security over shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer taken by the Security Agent acting at
the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination
provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the
Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior PIK Notes recover in any
insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no
assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior PIK Notes after the repayment in full of all
Senior Indebtedness.

Principal and Maturity

The Issuer will issue €475 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior PIK Notes on the Issue Date.
The Senior PIK Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. The Senior PIK Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof.

Interest

Interest on the Senior PIK Notes will accrue at the rate of 8.250% per annum with respect to interest
payments paid in cash (“Cash Interest”) or 9.000% per annum with respect to interest paid in kind by increasing
the principal amount of the outstanding Senior PIK Notes or issuing Additional Senior PIK Notes (“PIK Interest”).
Interest on the Senior PIK Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

###### 315


-----

    - be payable in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on October 15, 2021, except for
the final interest payment on the Maturity Date;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Senior PIK Notes on the Business Day immediately
preceding each interest payment date; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the
aggregate principal amount outstanding.

Interest payments for each interest period may be made as Cash Interest or PIK Interest, at the Issuer’s
sole option.

The Issuer will inform the Paying Agent and the Trustee of any election to pay Cash Interest or PIK
Interest with respect to each interest period by delivering a notice to the Paying Agent, with a copy to the
Trustee and the Registrar, at least three Business Day prior to the commencement of the relevant interest
period, specifying the amount of Cash Interest or PIK Interest, as applicable, to be paid. For the avoidance of
doubt, interest on the Senior PIK Notes shall be paid in 100% PIK Interest unless the Issuer makes an election to
pay Cash Interest, and failure by the Issuer to inform the Trustee and the Paying Agent or deliver such a notice
as set forth in this paragraph shall not require the Issuer to pay any Cash Interest.

With respect to the final interest period ending at the Stated Maturity of the Senior PIK Notes or upon
any redemption of the Senior PIK Notes, accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable in Cash Interest.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Senior PIK Notes are subject to the
applicable procedures of the common depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Senior PIK Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to
be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior PIK Notes

Principal, Cash Interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be
payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with
respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, Cash Interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents
maintained for such purposes. In addition, Cash Interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the
option of the Issuer, by wire transfer to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of
Senior PIK Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior PIK
_Notes”._

In the event that the Issuer elects to pay all or part of the interest on the Senior PIK Notes as PIK
Interest, such PIK Interest shall be paid as follows:

    - with respect to Senior PIK Notes represented by one or more Global Notes, (a) by increasing the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes in accordance with the procedures
of the relevant clearing system, effective as of the applicable interest payment date, by an amount
equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded down to the
nearest €1.00), or (b) if required, by issuing a new Global Note, dated as of the applicable interest
payment date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the
applicable interest period (rounded down to the nearest €1.00), executed by the Issuer,
authenticated by the Trustee pursuant to an authentication order issued by the Issuer under the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture and delivered by the Trustee for issuance to the Holders on the
relevant record date in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system; and

    - with respect to Senior PIK Notes represented by Definitive Registered Notes, by issuing Senior PIK
Notes in the form of Definitive Registered Notes, dated as of the applicable interest payment
date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable
interest period (rounded down to the nearest €1.00), executed by the Issuer, authenticated by the
Trustee pursuant to an authentication order issued by the Issuer under the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture and delivered by the Trustee in the form of Definitive Registered Notes for original
issuance to the Holders on the relevant record date, as shown by the records of the register of
Holders.

###### 316


-----

Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a payment
of PIK Interest, the Global Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the
applicable interest payment date. Any Senior PIK Notes issued in the form of Definitive Registered Notes will
be dated as of the first date of the following interest period and will bear interest from and after such date.
Senior PIK Notes issued pursuant to a payment of PIK Interest will have identical terms to the originally issued
Senior PIK Notes except interest on such Senior PIK Notes will begin to accrue from the date they are issued
rather than the Issue Date.

Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior PIK Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior PIK Notes. The initial Paying Agent
will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar, the Paying
Agent and Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior PIK Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Senior PIK Notes
on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior PIK Notes without
prior notice to the Holders of Senior PIK Notes. However, for so long as Senior PIK Notes are listed on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect
of the Senior PIK Notes.

Transfer and Exchange

The Senior PIK Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as follows:

    - Senior PIK Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

    - Senior PIK Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
“Notice to Investors”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures
and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

During the 40-day distribution compliance period (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation
S), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S.

###### 317


-----

Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law
of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such
transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof, in each case upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and
will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under
“Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior PIK Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000
in principal amount and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other
things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account
of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and
to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Senior PIK Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Senior PIK Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior PIK Notes to
be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date with
respect to such Senior PIK Notes; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holders of Senior PIK Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

For the purposes of the applicable securities depositories, the denomination of the Senior PIK Notes
should be considered as €1, and Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce the
minimum denomination or tradeable amount of €100,000.

Note Guarantees

_General_

The Senior PIK Notes will be guaranteed by the Company, Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Douglas GmbH,
Kirk Beauty Netherlands B.V., Parfümerie Douglas International GmbH, Parfümerie Douglas GmbH, Douglas
Finance B.V. and Douglas Einkaufs- und Servicegesellschaft mbH & Co. KG. on the Issue Date. Subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will also require the Issuer to cause, as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event on or prior to the date falling on the later of the date on which the
relevant Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days after the Issue
Date (in respect of Post-Closing Guarantors incorporated in Germany or the Netherlands) or on the later of the
date on which such Post-Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 90 days after
the Issue Date (in respect of Post-Closing Guarantors incorporated in Poland) after the Issue Date, certain
subsidiaries of the Issuer that also guarantee the Senior Secured Notes (the “Post-Closing Subsidiary
_Guarantors”) to guarantee the Senior PIK Notes on a senior subordinated basis. The Post-Closing Guarantors will_
be Kirk Beauty Netherlands Holding B.V., Parfümerie Douglas Deutschland GmbH, Douglas Grundstücks-und
Verwaltungsgesellschaft Zossen mbH, Douglas Marken-und Lizenzen GmbH & Co. KG,

###### 318


-----

Parfumerie Douglas Nederland B.V., Douglas Investment B.V. and “Douglas Polska” sp. z o.o. In addition,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will also require the Issuer to cause on
or prior to November 30, 2021 and only if the Post-Closing Reorganization has not been completed, the direct
parent company of the Company which will be either KB A or KBI, to guarantee the Senior PIK Notes on a
senior basis.

_Releases of Note Guarantees_

The Note Guarantee of any Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged:

    - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a Holding Company) or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described below “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock” and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company_
(prior to the Post-Closing Reorganization) or Issuer (following the completion of the Post-Closing
Reorganization), as applicable, as a result of the sale or other disposition;

    - upon the designation in accordance with the Senior PIK Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

    - as described in the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees”;_

    - as described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors”;

    - upon the release of the Guarantee and any other of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of
the relevant Note Guarantee under the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees” so long as no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other_
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor at that time is Guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

    - if such Guarantor is subject to or part of a Permitted Transaction, including the release upon the
completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization, of any Note Guarantees of KBI or KB A; or

    - upon redemption of all of the Senior PIK Notes.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases
or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably
requested by (and at the expense of) the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications including the delivery of a
customary Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel absolutely and without further enquiry. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of
the Trustee.

Security

_General_

On the Issue Date, the Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by security interests
over the following assets: (a) first-priority security interest over the issued share capital of the Issuer and any
intercompany receivables owed by the Issuer to KBI (the “Senior PIK Notes Only Collateral”), (b) a secondpriority security interest over the Proceeds Loan and (c) a second-priority security interest over the issued share
capital of the Company and any intercompany receivables owed by the Company to KBI and KB 2 KG (the
assets described in clauses (b) and (c) being the “Shared Collateral” and together with the Senior PIK Notes
Only Collateral, the “Collateral”).

###### 319


-----

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will also require the Issuer to cause, on or prior to November 30, 2021
and only if the Post-Closing Reorganization has not been completed, the Senior PIK Notes to be secured by
first-priority security interests over the shares of KBI (the “Holding Share Collateral”) and such additional
security shall constitute Senior PIK Notes Only Collateral.

In connection with the Post-Closing Reorganization, certain of the collateral will be released and new
security will be granted to give effect to the new structure. In particular, as part of the Post-Closing
Reorganization, KB A, will initially be the direct subsidiary of KBI, will replace KBI as the new direct parent of the
Issuer and the Company and subsequently, that the Issuer will replace KB A as the new direct parent of the
Company. In connection with such steps, KB A will assume the obligations of the Company under certain
shareholder loans and consequently, the security granted over the related receivable in favor of the Senior PIK
Notes will be released.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the Holders of the Senior PIK Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the
Collateral. Any additional security interests that may in the future be pledged to secure obligations under the
Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees would also constitute Collateral.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Issuer, the_
Company and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in
connection with certain future issuances of Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Company and their respective
Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Senior PIK Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Senior
PIK Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests”._

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders of Senior PIK Notes and the creditors of other obligations secured thereby. No appraisals of any
Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Security Agent or the Trustee in connection
with the offering of the Senior PIK Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have
no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period
of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The collateral may not be sufficient to secure the
_obligations under the Notes.”_

_Priority_

The Senior PIK Notes will be secured on an exclusive basis, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, by
the Senior PIK Notes Only Collateral.

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Shared Collateral that are created by the
Security Documents (the “Security Interests”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
(b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Agreements, (c) the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior PIK Notes under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture (d) the
trustee, the security agent and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and (e) certain other credit representatives, respectively, is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes are secured by a security interest on a first-priority basis in
the Shared Collateral and that the obligations under the Senior PIK Notes are secured by a security interest on
a second-priority basis in the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

_Security Documents_

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer, KBI and any other security provider will grant security over
the Collateral to secure the payment when due of, among others, the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the Senior PIK Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture. The Security
Documents have been or will be entered into by, among others as the case may be, the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents,

###### 320


-----

the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including the Trustee and
the Holders of Senior PIK Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will
also act as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Agreements in
relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will
be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior
PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release
_of Liens” below. See “—Enforcement of Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—There_
_are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing the Notes_
_and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the relevant_
_Trustee”. The validity and enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alios, the limitations_
described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests”._

Holders of the Senior PIK Notes may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce
any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders of the Senior PIK Notes may only act
through the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing
the creation and perfection of security interests in certain jurisdictions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security interests in such
jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Indebtedness under the Senior PIK Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the other secured obligations arising in connection with the Senior PIK Notes). The parallel
debt construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—The security interests in the collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than_
_directly to the holders of the Notes and certain collateral will be granted subsequent to the issuance of the_
_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

In the event that the Issuer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries enter into insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights
and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any
challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful,
the Holders of the Senior PIK Notes might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the
_Notes.”_

Subject to the terms of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, KBI and any security provider will have the
right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior PIK Notes, to
freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income
therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of
Capital Stock of the Issuer that is part of the Collateral).

_Enforcement of Security Interest; Limitations_

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of Senior PIK Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in relation to the Shared Collateral and provides for the
release of Security Interests over Shared Collateral created by the Security Documents upon a disposal of
Shared Collateral which is being effected (a) by way of an enforcement of Security Interests over the Shared
Collateral; (b) at the request of an instructing group of senior secured creditors in circumstances where the
Security Interests over the Shared Collateral have become enforceable; or (c) by a member of the Group or a
Holding Company of a member of the Group to a person outside of the Group following an acceleration of the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior PIK Notes or any other indebtedness ranking
pari passu with any of the foregoing. In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its behalf or on
behalf of the holders of the Senior Notes) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents in respect
of the Shared Collateral are subject to certain standstill provisions and other limitations on enforcement. The
ability of the holders of Senior PIK Notes to enforce Security Interests in the Shared Collateral may also be
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Shared Collateral in
compliance with the Senior PIK Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of Senior Secured Notes, the
counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Shared Collateral and the Trustee have, and, by
accepting a Senior PIK Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed, the Security Agent to act as its

###### 321


-----

agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including
the Security Documents, and by accepting a Senior PIK Note, each Holder will be deemed to have authorized
the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

The restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement do not restrict the ability of the Security Agent
(acting on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior PIK Notes and any future Pari Passu
Indebtedness of the Issuer) to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior PIK Notes Only Collateral or
against the Issuer in respect of its obligations under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Security Documents; Agreement to be Bound_

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Senior PIK Notes, by accepting
such Senior PIK Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” (including,
without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Collateral and
authorizing the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents on its behalf), as the
same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms;

(2) authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform their
respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance
therewith; and

(3) have appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements”._

_Release of Liens_

The Issuer and any security provider will be entitled to release Security Interests in respect of the
Collateral owned by it or by any such Guarantor under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than Security Interests in
respect any of the Capital Stock of the Company (prior to the completion of the Post-Closing
Reorganization only) or the Issuer (the “Company Share Collateral”) or any Holding Share
Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer or the Company, as applicable, (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the_
covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; provided that_
nothing in this clause (1) shall restrict the release of Security Interests in respect of the
Company Share Collateral or the Holding Share Collateral (x) to the extent that substantially
concurrently with such release, Liens over the Company Share Collateral or Holding Share
Collateral, as applicable, having equivalent ranking as prior to such release are granted for
the benefit of the Holders on substantially the same terms as the initial Security Interest or
(y) in connection with the Post-Closing Reorganization.

(2) other than in respect of Company Share Collateral or Holding Share Collateral, in the case of
a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

###### 322


-----

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior PIK Notes or
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior PIK Notes,
as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the release of
the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include
Collateral, or the sale of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, pursuant to a
Factoring Transaction;

(8) as permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” (or, in the case of the Company Share Collateral or Holding Share Collateral, that_
would be permitted by such covenant were it to apply to the security providers of such
Company Share Collateral or Holding Share Collateral, as applicable); or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior PIK Notes Indenture;

(10) if required to effect a Permitted Transaction; or

(11) upon redemption of all of the Senior PIK Notes.

In addition, the Company Share Collateral shall be permitted to be released in connection with the
Post-Closing Reorganization provided that any replacement Holdco has granted a security interest over the
shares that it owns in the Company. Further, the Security Interests in respect of the entire Capital Stock of the
Company, the Parent and/or the Issuer, as applicable, shall be permitted to be released within a reasonable
time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in which any of the Company, the Parent or the Issuer is the IPO Entity;
_provided that no Security Interests over the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of the IPO Entity may be_
released in reliance on this provision and provided further that such Security Interests so released shall be
promptly granted in favor of the Senior PIK Notes in the event that the Initial Public Offering is abandoned or
does not complete for any reason.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (to the extent action is required by it in order to effectuate such
release) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral
securing the Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the
consent of the Holders of Senior PIK Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by
it to effect such release).

The Proceeds Loan

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will loan the gross proceeds of the offering of the Senior PIK Notes
issued on the Issue Date to the Company (the “Proceeds Loan”) pursuant to a proceeds loan agreement (the
“Proceeds Loan Agreement”). The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Company will pay to the
Issuer Cash Interest and principal as, and to the extent that, it becomes payable on the Senior PIK Notes
(including any additional amounts due thereunder). The Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal
to the interest rate of the Senior PIK Notes and interest on the Proceeds Loan will be payable semi-annually in
arrears (i) if Cash Interest is payable under the Senior PIK Notes, at least one, and no more than five, Business
Days prior to the corresponding Cash Interest payment under the Senior PIK Notes and (ii) if PIK Interest is
payable under the Senior PIK Notes on the corresponding interest payment date. Principal payments of the
Proceeds Loan will be payable at least one, and no more than five, Business Days prior to a corresponding
payment of the Issuer to redeem or defease the Senior PIK Notes or as consideration payable under a Change
of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined below), each in accordance with the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture. The Company may on-lend a portion of the Proceeds Loan to certain of its Subsidiaries to
repay Indebtedness of those Subsidiaries.

The terms of the Proceeds Loan Agreement and any agreement governing such onlending of portions
of the Proceeds Loan will permit the prepayment of all such loans in whole or in part at any time. As a result, the
initial amount of the Proceeds Loan and such on-lending may be reduced, potentially to zero, prior to the
maturity of the Senior PIK Notes. Payments by the Company and any subsequent borrower under the Proceeds
Loan will be subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

###### 323


-----

The Proceeds Loan will be pledged on a second-priority basis to secure the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors under the Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees and will secure, on a first priority
basis, the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Credit Facilities.

IPO Debt Pushdown

On or following an Initial Public Offering (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of Collateral if required to implement such IPO Event), the Issuer shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Senior PIK Notes
Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown

Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or
assumes that any Person be a Released Person or that any liabilities or obligations to such
Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall, at the request of the Issuer
and without the consent of Holders, enter into any amendment or supplement to, release of, or replacement of,
the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Documents required by the Issuer
and/or take such other action as is requested by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant (collectively, an “IPO Pushdown”); provided, that such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee, the Security Agent or any other agents party thereto under the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or Security Documents. The Trustee, the Security Agent
and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the Senior
PIK Notes (without any consent by the Holders of the Senior PIK Notes) to execute any such amended, released
or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the
request of the Issuer).

For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary or a
Parent Entity of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the Person to be treated as the
IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the
entity that will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event and provided further that
either the Listed Entity shall be the Issuer or a direct subsidiary of the Listed Entity specified by the Company in
the Pushdown Notice shall become the Issuer.

If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to
the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown
Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (i) the provisions of clauses (1) to (10) of the first
paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any Collateral has
been released pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary will as soon as
reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that Collateral; and (iii) if any
Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity of a Released Person has been released from the
Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to clauses (9) or (10) of the first paragraph or the third paragraph of this
covenant in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement as the applicable Released Person. For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this
paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to
any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be
deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or

-----

At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2023 the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes (including any PIK Interest and the principal amount of any
Additional Senior PIK Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate
amount (the “Redemption Amount”) not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a
redemption price of 108.250% of the principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest) and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes issued under the Senior
PIK Notes Indenture (excluding any PIK Interest and Additional Senior PIK Notes) remains
outstanding immediately after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2023 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to
time, a part of any Senior PIK Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest) and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

_General_

We may repurchase the Senior PIK Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior PIK Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the optional
redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest) will be paid to the Person in whose name the
Senior PIK Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Senior PIK Notes are subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any tender offer for the Senior PIK Notes, including a Change of Control Offer or
Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior PIK Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior PIK Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of the Senior PIK Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to
redeem all Senior PIK Notes, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender
offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate
of Cash Interest) and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.
Without prejudice to any provision of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture regarding Senior PIK Notes deemed not
to be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders
of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior PIK Notes have validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn Senior PIK Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or
Asset Disposition Offer, Senior PIK Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed
by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of
such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior PIK Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control,
and Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction.
If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice
shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption
or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of
redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Issuer in their sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in
their sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so
delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines

###### 326


-----

that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer may redeem Senior PIK Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions
made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to
different provisions will have different redemption dates.

Sinking Fund

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior PIK Notes.

Selection and Notice

If less than all of the Senior PIK Notes is to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their respective participants’ accounts in compliance with their existing requirements and practices, or if
the Senior PIK Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no
method of selection, selection will be made on a pro rata basis by way of pool factor (or, in the case of Senior
PIK Notes issued in global form as discussed under “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”, based on a method that
most nearly approximates a pro rata selection); provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall
reduce the outstanding aggregate principal amount of any Senior PIK Note not redeemed to less than
€100,000. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in
accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior PIK Notes to be
redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with
a legal or covenant defeasance of the Senior PIK Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture.

If and for so long as any Senior PIK Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the Senior
PIK Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the
principal amount of Senior PIK Notes outstanding.

If any Senior PIK Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior PIK Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior PIK Notes called
for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Senior PIK Notes or portions of Senior PIK Notes called for redemption.

If the due date for any redemption payment in respect of the Senior PIK Notes is not a business day in
the place of payment (or from where the payment will be made), payment shall be made on the next
succeeding day that is a business day and no interest shall accrue in the intervening period.

Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Senior PIK Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Senior PIK Notes (with a copy to the Trustee
and the Paying Agents) (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest), if any, to the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined
below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date
as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

###### 327


-----

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or revenue guidance) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior PIK Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior PIK Notes (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in
Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to
make at least one payment on the Senior PIK Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after
such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or
amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any Senior
PIK Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that
it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing to the effect that the Payor (as defined below) has been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on
such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Withholding Taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the
Senior PIK Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such
Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior PIK Note is made, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by
or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2),
a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior PIK Note, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest
or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional
_Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such_
payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in
respect of such payments on any such Senior PIK Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being
resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from

###### 328


-----

the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior PIK Note or the receipt of any payment
or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior PIK Note, the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Senior PIK Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding is payable), to
provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality,
residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is
required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent
the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the
Senior PIK Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or
with respect to the Senior PIK Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior PIK Note presented for payment by or on
behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by
presenting the relevant Senior PIK Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another
Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(7) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or
any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior PIK Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner
would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner
held such Senior PIK Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the
full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in
accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts
to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of
such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will
attach to each certified copy a certificate or other reasonable evidence stating that the amount of withholding
Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount
of Senior PIK Notes then outstanding.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on
any Senior PIK Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to
pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the
payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on
such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

###### 329


-----

Wherever in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Senior PIK Notes or this “Description of the Senior PIK
_Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior PIK Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior PIK Notes or any Note
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holders, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent
and the Registrar for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar
charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property
or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that
arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or receipt of
payments with respect to, any Senior PIK Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the
Senior PIK Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies
that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Senior PIK Notes, to any such taxes or
similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior PIK
Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior PIK Notes is made by or on behalf of such
Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Change of Control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“Change of Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to
€100,000 or integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof, provided that Senior PIK Notes of €100,000 or less may
only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Senior PIK Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest (paid at
the rate of Cash Interest) and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any Senior PIK Notes as described_
under this heading “Change of Control”, in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its
right to redeem all of the Senior PIK Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior PIK Notes and given
notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send
a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer,
as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee) who will send such notice to each Holder of any Senior PIK Notes:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right
to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior PIK Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior PIK Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest) and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a
record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control
_Payment”);_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

###### 330


-----

(3) stating that any Senior PIK Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change
of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior PIK Notes or part thereof not tendered
will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior PIK Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior PIK Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as
applicable, an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior PIK
Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Senior PIK Notes or portions of the Senior PIK Notes being purchased by
the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior
PIK Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent or tender agent for such
Change of Control Offer, as applicable, will promptly mail or deliver to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior PIK Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note
equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior PIK Notes surrendered, if any; provided
that each such new Senior PIK Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior PIK Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to
the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of
Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior PIK Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior PIK Notes
in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the
Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior PIK Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a
third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change
of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuer and purchases all Senior PIK Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control
Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior PIK Notes has been given under “—Optional
_Redemption” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable_
redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained
in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the
consummation of such Change of Control.

###### 331


-----

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Section 14(e) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, conflict with provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer may
rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior PIK Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would
require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and would require
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to offer to repurchase all of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, certain
events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory
prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior
PIK Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of
certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon
a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the
Senior PIK Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the
Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing
financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make
any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise
_the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events_
_constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture and the change of control provision contained in_
_each Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as
to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior PIK Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior PIK Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes.

Certain Covenants

_Limitation on Indebtedness_

The Issuer will not, the Company will not, and each of the Issuer and the Company will not permit any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Issuer, the Company and

Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Note Guarantee, in the case of a
Guarantor to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement; and

Subsidiary, as the case may be;

-----

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall
be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the

included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer, the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any
redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) “Consolidated EBITDA” shall be calculated in accordance with the section “Certain
_Covenants—Financial Calculations” set forth below;_

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof
will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(9) in the event that the Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue
Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (28) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any ratios or baskets or other
applicable provision of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture for borrowings and reborrowings
thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) may be determined, at the Issuer’s option (A) on the date of such revolving credit
facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B) on the date on which such facility
or commitments become available (assuming, in the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (9) that
the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed
as of such date) and, in either case, if any such ratio or basket or other applicable provision of
the Senior PIK Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of any such ratio,
basket, provision of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
(the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of
this clause (9) but not actually borrowed on such date shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
_Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the_
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of any clause
of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses); and

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this
covenant or any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA as of any date of determination, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of determination of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate
amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue

discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs,
indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;
_provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in_
the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest,
accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and
such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket,
permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred. Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred or at the Issuer’s discretion, first committed or first Incurred or upon execution of the definitive
documentation in respect thereof; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded
so long as the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock)
of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of
Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency
Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

_Limitation on Layered Debt_

The Issuer will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer unless such Indebtedness is also
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior PIK Notes on substantially identical terms and no
Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of
payment to any other Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is pari passu with such
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to, such Guarantor’s
Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely
by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being

###### 342


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
the second paragraph of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
and/or (iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing
on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner
that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on any relevant
date of determination of such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market
value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

For the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBITDA,” pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to
purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to
Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect”
action by the Issuer, the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

_Limitation on Liens_

The Issuer will not, the Company will not, and each of the Issuer and the Company will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or
assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after
that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness
(such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,
(1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior PIK Notes and the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with
respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior PIK Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) above will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien
to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_

The Issuer will not, the Company will not, and each of the Issuer and the Company will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

###### 343

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination
of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer,
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer, the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior
Facilities Agreement), (b) the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into
on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or
relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date

instrument is assumed by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the
purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under
“—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer, the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement
or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial
_Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an_
agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided,
_however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary_
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect
to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement
or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the

set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer
of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property

any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Senior PIK Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement, together with
the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case,
as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or where the Issuer

Asset Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by
the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

none of the Issuer, the Company nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains
obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary

such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer, the Company or

Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this
clause (2).

If the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net

this clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an
offer to Holders to purchase their Senior PIK Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth

and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and/or redeem Notes pursuant to the
redemption provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or by making an Asset Disposition
Offer to all Holders of the Senior PIK Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out
below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

-----

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3),
(4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that, a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the
date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is
consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 395-day
period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The following amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes
“Excess Proceeds”:

(1) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (under and as defined in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as of the Issue Date) as at the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash is
greater than 4.0 to 1.0, 100% of such Net Available Cash; and

(2) if the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (under and as defined in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as of the Issue Date) as at the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash is
equal to or less than 4.0 to 1.0, 50% of such Net Available Cash;

_provided that if immediately prior to making an Asset Disposition Offer, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net_
Leverage Ratio (under and as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) falls into a lower threshold than
at the time initially calculated, then the relevant percentage of Net Available Cash that constitute Excess Cash
Proceeds shall be reduced accordingly.

Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce
indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

On the 396th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 576th day if a binding commitment as described in
clause (8) above has been entered into) or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €40 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be
required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum
principal amount of Senior PIK Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior PIK
Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than)
100% of the principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest), if any, to, but
not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof in the case of the Senior PIK Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior PIK Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds,
the Issuer, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose permitted by the Senior PIK Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior PIK
Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered
by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be
allocated among the Senior PIK Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata
basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior PIK Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into
their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero.

###### 347


-----

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior PIK Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior PIK Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior PIK Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the
currency in which such Senior PIK Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The provisions under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer
to repurchase the Senior PIK Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior PIK Notes.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior PIK Notes, will remain open for a period
of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than ten Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
_Purchase Date”), the Issuer will repay the principal amount of Senior PIK Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari_
Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
_Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior PIK_
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior PIK Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior PIK Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior PIK Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating
that such Senior PIK Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the
terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not
later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior PIK Notes so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue
a new Senior PIK Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent),
upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) such new Senior PIK Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior PIK Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior PIK Note will be
in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior PIK Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S.
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior PIK
Notes pursuant to the Senior PIK Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture
by virtue of such compliance.

_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_

The Issuer will not, the Company will not, and each of the Issuer and the Company will not permit any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related
transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service)
with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate
_Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €20 million and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA_
unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could
be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of
the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is
not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€40 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of
related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested
members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with
clause (1) above.

In addition, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act

any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were
restricted) constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition
and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition
and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).
Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company and the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Subject to compliance with the next paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company, the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ,
the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the
European Union) and the Company, the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission
and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the New
York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European
Union), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Company, the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in
a Member State of the European Union) pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards (or the
applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,

###### 353


-----

Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ,
the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the
European Union, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such
requirements require the Company, the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one
or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the New York Stock
Exchange or any other regulated stock exchange established in a Member State of the European Union, as
applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company
so long as such reports (if an annual, half-yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to
content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to such
Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information that explains in reasonable detail
the differences between, to the extent applicable: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Issuer, the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not the
Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total
consolidated amounts; or (y) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company that represents substantially all the assets of the Issuer, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
(the “Reporting Subsidiary”) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company
therein were references to the Reporting Subsidiary and (b) include condensed consolidated financial
information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between, to the extent applicable,: (i) the
Company; (ii) the Reporting Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) the Issuer any
other Subsidiaries of the Company that are not the Reporting Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Reporting
Subsidiary on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon
complying with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant will be made in the English language.

_Merger and Consolidation_

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United
Kingdom, any member state of the European Union, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Australia or any state thereof,
Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume,
(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior PIK Notes and the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that
becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company
or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Fixed Charge Coverage for
the Company or the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be at least 2.0
to 1.0 or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company or the Successor Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended Relevant Period immediately
preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee (and the Trustee will be able to rely without
further inquiry on) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that

###### 354


-----

such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with
the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a
legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company in
accordance with its terms (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result
of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with
respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties
and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the Issuer will not be released from its obligations under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or the Senior
PIK Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
“—Merger and Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset
Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms
of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the
surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets
of such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor (with its Note Guarantee subject to limitation as set forth in the
Agreed Security Principles) substantially concurrently with such consolidation,
merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) [reserved];

(c) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the surviving entity or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Note Guarantee and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental
indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
and with its Note Guarantee subject to limitation as set forth in the Agreed Security
Principles); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

###### 355


-----

(d) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer, the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clauses (a) and (c)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference or thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, including in each case the views,
guidance or interpretation of the relevant regulator; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with
respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all
or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of
its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule,
regulation or order, recommendation or direction of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Issuer, the Company and/or any Restricted Subsidiary; (iv) any consolidation or merger of
the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or
consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior PIK Notes, the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction;
(v) the solvent liquidation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (vi) the Issuer or any Guarantor
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of such entity or (vii) the Post-Closing Reorganization; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and
(4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to any such transaction in respect of the Issuer.

_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior PIK Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status
and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior PIK Notes cease to have Investment Grade
Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture summarized under the following
captions will not apply to the Senior PIK Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default

###### 356


-----

or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in
effect since the date of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event.
On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be
deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Senior
PIK Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer, the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on
which the Senior PIK Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments
were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior PIK Notes no longer
having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for
the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that
the Senior PIK Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

_Impairment of Security Interest_

The Issuer will not, the Company will not, and each of the Issuer and the Company will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the
proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security
interests in respect of the Collateral shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer will not, the
Company will not, and each of the Issuer and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to
any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Issuer, the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the
covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Limitation on Liens”, including Permitted
Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred and released and retaken, if applicable, in
accordance with the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement

Subject to the foregoing, the applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released and retaken from time to time to (1) cure
any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (2) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens,
(3) add to the Collateral, (4) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect, or (5) for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Transaction or the Post-Closing
Reorganization; provided, however, that in the case of clause (4) above, the Security Documents may not be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either
(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the relevant Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors, Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Executive Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security
Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications
customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, release, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

_Additional Guarantees_

The Company shall cause, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, as soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Issue Date and in any event on or prior to the date falling (a) on the later of the date on
which such Post-Closing Subsidiary Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and 30 days

###### 357


-----

after the Issue Date and (b) on the later of the date on which such Post Closing Guarantor provides a guarantee
of the Senior Credit Facilities and 90 days after the Issue Date, as applicable, each Post-Closing Guarantor to:

(1) execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee
on a senior subordinated basis; and

(2) accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Company shall procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on or prior to
November 30, 2021 and only if the Post-Closing Reorganization has not been completed, either KB A or KBI,
whichever is the direct parent company of the Company, shall (1) execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior PIK Notes Indenture pursuant to which such
Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee which will be pari passu with, or senior to, any other Indebtedness of
KB A or KBI, as applicable and (2) accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company will not cause or permit any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities, any Credit Facility (in an aggregate amount of all such Guarantees of such other Credit Facilities
exceeding €50 million outstanding) or any other Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless
such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the
Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
providing for a Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be subordinated to
any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee
is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or thin
capitalization rules, retention of title claims, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations
(or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary
(or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than
reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on
Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financials
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. This paragraph shall not be applicable to
any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary
and was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Releases of
_Note Guarantees”. A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at_
the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred
after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior PIK Notes Indenture
if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance
with the Senior PIK Notes Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a
Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors”.

_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer and without the consent
of Holders, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of any
(1) Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the Company, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor_

###### 358


-----

Agreement on substantially the same terms (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of
the Security Interest; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement or restatement, amendment or
modification of the Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the
consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking pari passu or junior in right of payment to the Senior PIK Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior PIK Notes
(including Additional Senior PIK Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to
secure Additional Senior PIK Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any
other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect
their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture also will provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior PIK Notes thereby; provided, however, that such
transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior PIK Note,
shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior
written request at the offices of the Issuer or at the offices of the listing agent.

_Post-Closing Reorganization_

KBI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure that the Senior PIK Issuer Reorganization is
completed; provided that if the completion does not occur as a result of any action or inaction of any judicial or
regulatory authority or because KBI determines, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the completion of the
Senior PIK Issuer Reorganization would contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of
personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer, then KBI shall be deemed to have used its commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with this covenant.

_Financial Calculations_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this section.
Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated with reference to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for
purposes of calculating compliance with any covenant determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA.

For the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio or compliance with any covenant determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA, for a Specified
Transaction (and the Incurrence or repayment of any Indebtedness in connection therewith) that has been
made (i) during the applicable Relevant Period or (ii) subsequent to such Relevant Period and prior to or

###### 359


-----

simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a pro
forma basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated
EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had
occurred on the first day of the applicable Relevant Period. If since the beginning of any applicable Relevant
Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or
consolidated with or into any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such Relevant Period shall have
made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this section, then the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA shall be
calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this section.

Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall
be made in good faith by an Officer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run rate” cost
savings, operating expense reductions and synergies (excluding revenue synergies) projected by the Issuer in
good faith to be realized as a result of specified actions taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken
(calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies had
been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and
synergies were realized during the entirety of such period) relating to such Specified Transaction and run rate
means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken, committed to be taken or
with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken, net of the amount of
actual benefits realized during such period from such actions; provided that (i) such amounts are reasonably
identifiable, quantifiable and factually supportable in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, (ii) such actions are
taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of such Specified
Transaction and (iii) no amounts shall be added pursuant to this paragraph to the extent duplicative of any
amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA, whether through a pro forma
adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period; provided, that any such adjustments made under this
paragraph, together with any “run rate” adjustments under clause (13) of the definition of Consolidated
EBITDA, shall not exceed 20% of Consolidated EBITDA after giving effect to all other adjustments permitted by
the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”; provided, further, that at the election of the Issuer (in its sole and
absolute discretion), such amounts shall not be required to be determined for any Specified Transaction to the
extent the aggregate consideration paid in connection with such Specified Transaction was equal to or less
than €25 million.

In the event that the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs (including by assumption
or guarantees) or repays (including by repurchase, redemption, repayment, retirement, defeasance,
extinguishment or other discharge) any Indebtedness included in the calculations of the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as the case may be (in each case, other than Indebtedness
Incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business for working capital
purposes), (i) during the applicable Relevant Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Relevant
Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then
the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro
forma effect to such Incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had
occurred on the last day of the applicable Relevant Period with the change in any associated Fixed Charges
being calculated as if such Incurrence or repayment occurred on the first day of such Relevant Period; provided
that (A) such pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (x) any Indebtedness Incurred on the date on which
the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”)
pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or (y) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such_
discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (B) the cash proceeds (and any resulting cash and
Cash Equivalent Investments) of such Incurred Indebtedness shall be excluded from amounts that may be
netted in the calculation of pro forma Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. If any Indebtedness bears a floating
rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if
the rate in effect on the date such calculation is being made had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Swap Contract applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease
Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by an Officer to be the rate of
interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with the relevant Accounting Principles. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit
facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a LIBOR interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall
be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate
chosen as the Issuer may designate.

With respect to any basket or threshold that is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated at all times as if

###### 360


-----

Capitalized Lease Obligations are calculated on the basis of IFRS as in effect prior to January 1, 2019,
irrespective of whether an IFRS 16 Election has been made.

On and after the date pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition or Investment and on which the
Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is Incurring Indebtedness, which acquisition or Investment
has yet to be consummated but for which a definitive agreement governing such acquisition or Investment has
been executed and remains in effect, such pro forma effect shall be deemed to continue at all times thereafter
for purposes of determining ratio-based conditions and baskets until the earlier of the date such acquisition or
Investment is consummated or the date such definitive agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation.

Without prejudice to the rights of the Restricted Group under the foregoing paragraphs:

(a) for the purposes of the determination of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the exchange rates used in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA
shall be the weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period as determined by the
Issuer; and

(b) for the purposes of the determination of Consolidated Total Debt and Consolidated Total Net
Debt in respect of any period, the exchange rates used for the determination of Consolidated
Total Debt and Consolidated Total Net Debt for that relevant period shall be (A) in relation to
Indebtedness for which the Restricted Group has entered into cross currency swaps, the rate
at which such swap has been entered into and (B) in relation to all other Indebtedness, the
exchange rate used in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA or calculated in accordance
with paragraph (i) above.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the terms of the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture require (i) compliance with any financial ratio or test, any Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test or
any Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test and/or any threshold expressed as a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA in connection with the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Equity Interests, the
creation of Liens, the making of any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted
Payment, the designation of a Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the
repayment of Indebtedness or Disqualified Equity Interests, (ii) the absence of a Default or Event of Default (or
any type of Default or Event of Default) as a condition or (iii) satisfaction of all other conditions precedent to the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Equity Interests, the creation of Liens, the making of
any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment, the designation of a
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the repayment of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Equity Interests, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, the
determination of such ratio or other provisions, determination of whether any Default or Event of Default has
occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom or the satisfaction of any other conditions shall, at the
election of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition
Transaction, an “LCT Election”, which LCT Election may be in respect of one or more of paragraphs (i), (ii) and
(iii) above), be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements (or other relevant definitive documentation)
for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”). If on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness or Disqualified Equity Interests and the use of
proceeds thereof), with such ratios and other provisions calculated as if such Limited Condition Transaction or
other transactions had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Relevant Period ending prior to the LCT
Test Date, the Issuer could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the
applicable ratios or other provisions, such provisions shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the
avoidance of doubt, if any of such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the person subject to such acquisition or investment, at
or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratios will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the relevant transaction or
action is permitted to be consummated or taken; provided that if such ratios improve as a result of such
fluctuations, such improved ratios may be utilized. In connection with any action being taken in connection with
a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision which requires
that no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or
would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed
satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date
the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof)

###### 361


-----

is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted
under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or
amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

Prior to the completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated to include (without duplication)
any applicable Indebtedness, Fixed Charges or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company, the Issuer and their
respective Restricted Subsidiaries. After the completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization, the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated as if
references to the “Company” are references to the “Issuer”.

Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior PIK Note issued under the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior PIK Note
issued under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after
notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Senior PIK Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Company, the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by the Issuer, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary) other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment
default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €40 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Holdcos, the Company, the
Parent, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company, the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final
judgments aggregating in excess of €40 million other than any judgments covered by
indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy
companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or
Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of €20 million
for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the
Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

###### 362


-----

Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall
be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such
Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of the Company, the Parent or a Significant Subsidiary (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee, the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to
any limitations)) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases to
be in full force and effect or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms
in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10
days.

However, a default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior PIK Notes under the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure
such default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior PIK Notes under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the
Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest) on all the Senior PIK Notes under the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and
unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above
occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior
PIK Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holders.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior PIK Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration
of the Senior PIK Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering
such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration
of the Senior PIK Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Holders of the Senior PIK Notes may not enforce the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or the Senior PIK
Notes except as provided in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents
except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior PIK Notes under the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration
with respect to such Senior PIK Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders
unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity, security or prefunding
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment
of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture or the Senior PIK Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior PIK Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered and, if requested, the Trustee has received, the Trustee security,
prefunding or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request
and the offer of such security, prefunding or indemnity; and

###### 363


-----

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior PIK Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default of which the Trustee
has actual knowledge has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers
to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior PIK Notes Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification, security or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee
is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior PIK Note, the Trustee may (without liability for so
doing) withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further
inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the
signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within
30 days after any Officer of the Issuer becomes aware of any events which would constitute a Default, written
notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action
the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of
any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references
the Senior PIK Notes and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also
be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of this Senior PIK Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such
delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in
certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified, prefunded or secured to its satisfaction. It may not
be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior PIK Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and
it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior PIK Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior PIK
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior PIK Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Senior PIK Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior PIK Notes). Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90%
(or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes then
outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior PIK Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior PIK Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior PIK
Note;

###### 364


-----

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior PIK Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior PIK Note or change the time
at which any Senior PIK Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under
“—Optional Redemption” and “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(5) make any Senior PIK Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior PIK Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior PIK Notes on or after
the due dates therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture described under
“Withholding Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior PIK Notes in
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior PIK Notes in a way that would result
in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from
any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer or the
applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than
in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior PIK Notes (except pursuant to a
rescission of acceleration of the Senior PIK Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Senior PIK Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior
PIK Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the
Issuer or any Guarantor under any Senior PIK Notes Document, including without limitation,
in connection with a Permitted Transaction;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(4) make any change (including changing the ISIN, Common Code or other identifying number
on any Senior PIK Notes) that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the
Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the
Holders in any material respect under the Senior PIK Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior PIK Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees, to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Senior PIK_
Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior PIK Notes, or to confirm and
evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof

###### 365

with respect to or securing the Senior PIK Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security
Documents or the Senior PIK Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior PIK
_Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Senior PIK Notes” was_
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, the
Note Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Senior PIK Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the
Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent,
or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior PIK
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is
complied with;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture relating to the
transfer and legending of Senior PIK Notes as permitted by the Senior PIK Notes Indenture,
including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Senior PIK Notes; provided,
however, that (i) compliance with this Senior PIK Notes Indenture as so amended would not
result in Senior PIK Notes being transferred in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any other
applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of
Holders to transfer Senior PIK Notes in any material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Merger and_
_Consolidation”, relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or_

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

In connection with such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely on an
Officer’s Certificate and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior PIK Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior
PIK Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior PIK Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s
Senior PIK Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with,
“—Certain Covenants” or this “—Amendments and Waivers” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of
Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior PIK Notes.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section “—Amendments and Waivers” to add a
Guarantor under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture
providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer,
(ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the
extent applicable).

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a
consent fee to Holders.

###### 366

Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior PIK Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior PIK Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer
will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether
the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Senior PIK Notes that a
responsible officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.

Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior
PIK Notes and the Senior PIK Notes Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and
Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in
connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior PIK Notes, registration of Senior PIK
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior PIK Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration
provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment
default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of
_Default” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Senior PIK Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior PIK Notes.
If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior PIK Notes, payment of the
Senior PIK Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with
respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”, (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default”_
above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this
purpose) cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an
amount sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior PIK Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be, provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of
the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such
amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the
date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption and must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,
to the effect that Holders of the relevant Senior PIK Notes will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred;

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent

provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be,
have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in
connection with either defeasance option.

Satisfaction and Discharge

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior
PIK Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior PIK Notes
when (1) either (a) all the Senior PIK Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost,
stolen or destroyed Senior PIK Notes, and certain Senior PIK Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior PIK Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer;
(2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or
appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), money or in euro or euro-denominated European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Senior PIK Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior PIK Notes that have become
due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be provided that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of this Senior PIK Notes Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to
the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium
Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption, and any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously
with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall
be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under
the Senior PIK Notes Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
funds deposited towards the payment of the Senior PIK Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which the Trustee may rely on without further inquiry) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under
the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely
on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1),
(2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent (or other entity directed, designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) will
distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case
may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the
Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance
of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above
will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such
amounts.

No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Senior PIK Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior PIK Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior PIK Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that
such a waiver is against public policy.

Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior PIK Notes
Indenture. The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

###### 368


-----

During the existence of an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee will exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior PIK Notes Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take
or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be
removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any
time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior PIK Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict
of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or
bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior PIK Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any
loss, liability, expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior PIK Notes Indenture.

Notices

If and for so long as Senior PIK Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior PIK Notes will be sent to the
Exchange. In addition, for so long as any Senior PIK Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders of the Senior PIK Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day
after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by firstclass mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given through
Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Senior PIK Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against
the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior PIK Notes will be prescribed five years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior PIK Notes and the Note Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due
to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to
make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

###### 369


-----

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Senior PIK Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by
such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient
or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of
this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a
Senior PIK Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources
of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate
and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate
and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior PIK
Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and
effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due
under any Senior PIK Note or any Note Guarantee of a Senior PIK Note, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

Listing

Application will be made to list the Senior PIK Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted
to deal in the Senior PIK Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Senior
PIK Notes on the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior PIK Notes thereon will be
granted, and settlement of the Senior PIK Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

Enforceability of Judgments

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect
to the Senior PIK Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

Indenture and the Senior PIK Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior PIK Notes Indenture

New York, County and State of New York, United States.

thereunder, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The

###### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM

General

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule
144A Global Notes”). Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the “Rule 144A Global Notes,” the “Global Notes”). The
Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together
with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. BookEntry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Senior
Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. The Book-Entry Interests in the Senior PIK Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof.

Except under the limited circumstances described below, the Book-Entry Interests will not be held in
definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and
transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of
some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the
ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of
interest in the Global Notes will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indentures for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will be considered the sole registered holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under
the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indentures.

None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any
of their respective affiliates will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

    - if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the applicable Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the applicable Issuer
within 120 days; or

    - if the owner of a Book-Entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indentures and enforcement
action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indentures.

In such an event, the applicable Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is not required by the
Indentures or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the applicable Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of
the relevant Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of
the applicable Issuer and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

###### 406


-----

The Issuers will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and Clearstream.

Redemption of Global Notes

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders
of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of
such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with
the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuers understand that under existing
practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that
no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

Payments on Global Notes

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any,
interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuers to the respective Principal
Paying Agent. In turn, each Principal Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depository for
Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective procedures. The applicable Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Withholding Taxes” If any such deduction_
or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the applicable Issuer_
will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the
Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts
that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest,
as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The applicable Issuer expects that standing
customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indentures governing the Notes, the applicable Issuers, the Trustee, the
Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and their respective agents will treat the registered
holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
Issuers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such for any such
payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

Currency and payment for the Global Notes

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Euro.

###### 407


-----

Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised each Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be
taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other
action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of
Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in
certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

Transfers

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must
transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements discussed in
“Notice to Investors”.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes
and the closing of the offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated
in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the
applicable Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the applicable Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities
laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
without compliance with these certification requirements.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the relevant
Rule 144A Global Note.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon
receipt by the applicable Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the applicable Indenture)
from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144
under the Securities Act or any other exception (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange” and Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of_
the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and
become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and
_Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers_
to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

###### 408

Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The applicable Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system
are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the
Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to
their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently,
the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A
Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

Global clearance and settlement under the Book-Entry System

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuers, any Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Principal
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear,
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

Initial settlement

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

Secondary market trading

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

###### CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES

German taxation

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposal of the Notes. This discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all
German tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes. In particular, this discussion
does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is
based on the laws (including tax treaties) currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering
memorandum in the Federal Republic of Germany which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or
retrospective effect.

The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate (‘‘flat tax regime’’; Abgeltungssteuer) for
certain investment income and, in particular, interest income on the part of German tax resident private
investors. There is an ongoing discussion in Germany whether the reduced tax rate should be increased or
abolished so that investment income would be taxed at higher rates. It is still unclear whether, how and when
the current discussion may result in any legislative changes. If the ‘‘flat tax regime’’ for interest income were
repealed, this would, most likely, result in the taxation of interest income (derived from private investments) at
the regular progressive tax rates of up to 45% (plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge (Solidaritatszuschlag) thereon)
on the part of German tax resident individuals.

PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS
AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL OF THE NOTES,
INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY STATE OR LOCAL TAXES UNDER THE TAX LAWS APPLICABLE IN THE
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND EACH COUNTRY OF WHICH THEY ARE RESIDENTS OR WHOSE
TAX LAWS APPLY TO THEM FOR OTHER REASONS.

_Withholding Tax_

For German tax residents (e.g., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of
management is located in Germany), interest payments on the Notes are subject to withholding tax, provided
that the Notes are held in custody with a German custodian, who is required to deduct the withholding tax from
such interest payments (the “Disbursing Agent”). Disbursing Agents are German resident credit institutions and
financial services institutions (including in both cases German permanent establishments of foreign
institutions), securities trading companies or securities trading banks. The applicable withholding tax rate is
25% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%). If the individual holder is
subject to church tax, a church tax surcharge will also be withheld. For the church tax surcharge, an electronic
information system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income, with the
effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has
filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für
_Steuern) in which case the investor will be assessed to church tax._

The withholding tax regime generally also applies to any gains from the sale, transfer or redemption of
Notes realized by private investors holding the Notes as private (and not as business) assets in custody with a
Disbursing Agent. Subject to exceptions, the amount of capital gains on which the withholding tax charge is
applied is generally levied on the difference between the proceeds received upon the sale, transfer or
redemption of the Notes and (after the deduction of actual expenses directly related thereto) the acquisition
costs. If Notes held or managed in the same custodial account were acquired at different points in time, the
Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes of determining any capital gains.
Where the Notes are acquired and/or sold in a currency other than Euro, the sales/redemption price and/or the
acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the
sale, transfer or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively. If interest claims are disposed of
separately (i.e. without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are also subject to withholding tax. The
same applies to proceeds from the payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

If the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since their
acquisition and the current Disbursing Agent has not been notified of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes
in the form required by law (e.g. by the previous Disbursing Agent), the tax at a rate of 25% (plus 5.5%
solidarity surcharge thereon, the total withholding being 26.375% and, if applicable, church tax) will be
imposed on an amount equal to 30% of the proceeds from the sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes.

In computing any withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent generally deducts from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the private individual investor via the Disbursing Agent
(e.g. losses from sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent also deducts

###### 410


-----

accrued interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security
via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent
credits foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the
private individual investor in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

The withholding tax is not applied to the extent the total investment income of a private investor is not
exceeding the lump sum deduction (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for
partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft)
filing jointly), provided that the private individual investor files an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag)
with the Disbursing Agent. Expenses of the private individual investor actually incurred are not deductible. No
withholding tax will be levied if a private individual investor has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate
of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent German tax office.

German resident corporate and other German resident business investors (including those investing
via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal
forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) should in
essence not be subject to the withholding tax on gains from the sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes
(i.e., for these investors only interest payments, but not gains from the sale, transfer or redemption of the
Notes, are subject to the withholding tax regime). In computing the withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent will
not account for any deductions of foreign tax and capital losses incurred.

Interest and capital gains received on the Notes by non-tax residents of Germany are, in general, not
subject to German withholding tax or solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain
is subject to German taxation (as set forth under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non Tax
_Residents”) and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be_
levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be (partially) refunded based on an assessment to
tax or under an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management is located in Germany).

_Private Individual Investors_

Income (i.e., interest and capital gains) derived under the Notes held by a private individual investor
who is tax resident in Germany, irrespective of any holding period, is in general subject to German income tax
at a flat tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer).
Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer_Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered_
partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred
higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

For private individual investors the withholding tax is—without prejudice to certain exceptions—
definitive. Private individual investors can apply to have their income from the investment into the Notes
assessed in accordance with the general rules on determining an individual’s tax bracket if this would result in a
lower tax burden. The deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not
permitted.

To the extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad
or if no Disbursing Agent is involved in the payment process, the private individual investor must report his or
her income and capital gains derived from the Notes on his or her tax return and then will also be taxed at a
rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax if applicable, thereon). If the withholding tax on a sale,
transfer or redemption of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than on the basis of the actual gain), a private individual investor may and in case the actual gain is higher than
30% of the disposal proceeds must also apply for an assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition
costs.

Losses resulting from the sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes can only be set off against other
investment income. In the event that a set-off is not possible in the assessment period in which the losses have
been realized, such losses can be carried forward into future assessment periods only and can be set off
against investment income generated in future assessment periods. However, if the losses result from the full or

###### 411


-----

partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including a default of the Issuer or a
(voluntary) waiver, such losses together with other losses of such kind of the same year and loss-carry forwards
of previous years can only be offset up to an amount of EUR 20,000 (“Limitation on Loss Deduction”). Any
exceeding loss amount can be carried forward and offset against future investment income, but again subject
to the EUR 20,000 limitation. Pursuant to the legislative reasoning, a non-recoverability shall also be assumed if,
based on the overall assessment of the facts and circumstances, it becomes apparent that the Issuer will not
redeem the Notes in full, e.g. because the solvency risk has already materialized. Given that the Limitation on
Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the Notes in
custody, holders suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare
such losses in their income tax return.

_Business Investors_

Interest payments and capital gains from the sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes held as
business assets by German tax resident business investors are generally subject to German income tax or
corporate income tax (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and church tax (where applicable) thereon). The
respective investor will have to report income and related (business) expenses on the tax return and the
balance will be taxed at the investor’s applicable tax rate. Any withholding tax deducted from interest
payments is subject to certain requirements creditable as advance payment against the personal or corporate
income tax liability of the holder. To the extent the amount withheld exceeds the (corporate) income tax
liability, the withholding tax is—as a general rule—refundable.

The interest payments and capital gains are also subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer), if the
Notes are attributable to a German trade or business. The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax
factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade
tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax
credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e.,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not located in
Germany).

Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any)
from the sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany are
generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a
permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the
holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income. To the extent the German source
income is subject to German withholding tax, this withholding tax is, in general, final and the German tax
liability is satisfied by the tax withheld.

Where the German source income is not subject to German withholding tax or in case Notes form part
of the business property of a German permanent establishment as described in this paragraph above, a tax
regime similar to that explained above under “Tax Residents” applies. Subject to certain requirements, a holder
who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided under an
applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) and German tax law.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax_

Inheritance or gift taxes with respect to the Notes will, in principle, arise under German law if, in the
case of inheritance tax, either the decedent or the beneficiary or, in the case of gift tax, either the donor or the
donee is a resident of Germany at the relevant point in time, or if the Notes are attributable to a German trade
or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been
appointed in Germany. In addition, certain German expatriates who previously maintained a residence in
Germany will be subject to inheritance and gift tax.

However, applicable double taxation treaties may provide for exceptions to the German domestic
inheritance and gift tax regulations.

_Other Taxes_

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial fees). Under

###### 412


-----

certain conditions, entrepreneurs (for value added tax purposes) may opt for a liability to value added tax with
regard to the sale of Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is
not levied in Germany.

_Amendments to the Solidarity Surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) Regime_

As of the assessment period 2021, the solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished for certain
individuals. The solidarity surcharge, however, continues to apply for capital investment income and, thus, on
withholding taxes levied. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder is lower than 25%
the holder can apply for his/her capital investment income being assessed at his/her individual tariff-based
income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

_The proposed Financial Transactions Tax_

The European Commission has published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for
a common financial transactions tax (the “FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal is currently under review and remains subject to negotiations between the
participating member states. The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced,
apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

However, it is still unclear if and when an FTT will be implemented and what the exact scope will be.

Prospective holders of the Notes could be exposed to higher transaction fees and are advised to seek
their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following discussion is a summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion addresses only
U.S. Holders (as defined below) who purchase Notes in the offering at the original offering price, hold Notes as
capital assets and use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This discussion is not a complete description of
all U.S. tax considerations relating to purchase, ownership and disposition of a Note. It does not address the tax
treatment of prospective purchasers subject to special rules, such as banks and certain other financial
institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark-to-market, insurance companies,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax,
investors required to take certain amounts into income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on their
audited financial statements, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities, pass-through entities (including partnerships
and S-corporations) or persons holding Notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other integrated
financial transaction. It also does not address the tax treatment of U.S. Holders that will hold Notes in connection
with a permanent establishment or fixed base outside of the United States. This summary also does not address
U.S. federal taxes other than the income tax (such as the Medicare surtax on net investment income or estate or
gift taxes) or U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax laws or considerations. The following discussion assumes that
the Notes will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

EACH PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE FROM ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS ABOUT
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER ITS OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF INVESTING IN NOTES
UNDER THE LAWS OF GERMANY, THE UNITED STATES AND ITS CONSTITUENT JURISDICTIONS AND ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE THE PURCHASER MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other business entity
treated as a corporation) that is organized under the laws of the United States or its political subdivisions, (iii) a
trust subject to the control of a U.S. person and the primary supervision of a U.S. court or (iv) an estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or an entity treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that acquires, owns or disposes of a Note generally will
depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective investor that is a
partnership should consult its own advisors about the tax consequences for its partners of the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of a Note.

_Senior Secured Notes_

_Characterization of the Senior Secured Notes_

All or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed prior to their stated maturity at
redemption prices equal to 100% of the principal amount of the relevant Notes redeemed plus accrued and

###### 413


-----

unpaid interest to the redemption date and additional amounts, if any, plus either (i) a “make-whole” premium
or (ii) a premium over their principal amount, as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Optional Redemption.” In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the_
holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have the right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control.” The rules applicable to debt instruments with payment_
contingencies are unclear. In general, if the amount or timing of any payment on a debt instrument is
contingent and the amount or the contingency is neither remote nor incidental, the debt instrument could be
subject to special rules that apply to contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”). The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer intends to take the position that the occurrence of such events is remote and that, therefore, the
possibility of such payments does not result in the Senior Secured Notes being treated as CPDIs for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such
holder discloses that it is taking a contrary position on a statement attached to its tax return in the manner
required by applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s position is not, however,
binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and if the IRS were successfully to assert, and a court were
to sustain, a contrary position, all stated interest received by U.S. Holders would generally be treated as original
issue discount (“OID”) with the result that a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue OID on the Senior Secured
Notes prior to receipt of or in excess of stated interest and gain realized on a sale or other taxable disposition
of the Senior Secured Notes would be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. The remainder of
this discussion assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will not be treated as CPDIs. Prospective purchasers of
the Senior Secured Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the treatment of the Senior Secured
Notes as CPDIs.

_Interest and Original Issue Discount on Senior Secured Notes_

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes, including any tax withheld therefrom and Additional Amounts
paid in respect of such withholding, if any, generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder in
accordance with its regular method of tax accounting. The interest generally will be ordinary income from
sources outside the United States. Subject to applicable limitations, a U.S. Holder may claim a deduction or a
foreign tax credit only for tax withheld at the appropriate rate.

If the Senior Secured Notes are issued with more than a statutory de minimis amount of OID, a U.S.
Holder must accrue the OID into income on a constant yield to maturity basis whether or not it receives cash
payments. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued with OID to the extent that their stated redemption price at
maturity exceeds their issue price. However, a U.S. Holder will not have to accrue the OID if such excess is less
than ¼ of 1% of the stated redemption price at maturity of the Senior Secured Notes multiplied by the number
of complete years to their maturity (“de minimis OID”). The issue price of the Senior Secured Notes is the initial
price at which a substantial amount of the Senior Secured Notes are first sold to the public (excluding sales to
underwriters, placement agents, brokers or similar persons). The stated redemption price at maturity is
generally the sum of all payments due on a Senior Secured Note other than payments of stated interest that is
unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate or, subject to certain conditions, one or more
qualified floating rates. Any redemption premium that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to offer to
pay following a Change of Control is not part of the stated redemption price for this purpose because the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not believe that a Change of Control is significantly more likely than not to
occur. The applicable “make whole” premium or redemption premium, if any, due on an optional redemption
of the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, is not treated as part of the stated redemption price for this
purpose because under applicable OID rules, an issuer option that would increase a debt instrument’s yield to
maturity are presumed not to be exercised. OID, if any, will be treated as ordinary income from sources outside
of the United States.

If the Senior Secured Notes are issued with more than a statutory de minimis amount of OID, a U.S.
Holder generally must include in income the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to a Senior
Secured Note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which such holder held that
Senior Secured Note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual
period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” for a debt
instrument issued with OID may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the debt instrument,
provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or
interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. OID for any accrual period will be
determined in Euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an
accrual method U.S. Holder, as described below.

The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of: (i) the product of the Senior Secured Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the
beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close

###### 414


-----

of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period, over (ii) the aggregate of all
qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference
between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of qualified stated interest, and the adjusted
issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a note at the beginning of
any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period, and
reduced by any payments previously made on the Senior Secured Note other than a payment of qualified
stated interest. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder will generally have to include in income increasingly greater
amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.

A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all yield on a Senior Secured Note (including de
minimis OID) using a constant yield method. The constant yield election will generally apply only to the Senior
Secured Note with respect to which it is made, and it may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

A cash basis U.S. Holder receiving stated interest in Euro must include in income a U.S. dollar amount
based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt whether or not the payment is converted to U.S.
dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder (and a cash basis U.S. Holder accruing OID) generally must include in
income a U.S. dollar amount based on the average exchange rate during the accrual period (or, for an accrual
period that spans two taxable years, the partial accrual period within each taxable year). An accrual basis U.S.
Holder (and a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to OID) may elect to translate accrued interest into U.S.
dollars at the spot exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the first taxable year for
the initial portion of an accrual period that spans two taxable years) or, with respect to interest received within
five business days of the last day of an interest accrual period, the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt.
Currency translation elections apply to all debt instruments that the electing U.S. Holder holds or acquires, and
they cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Upon receipt of a payment in Euro (including, upon sale of a Senior Secured Note, the receipt of
proceeds which include accrued OID and accrued, unpaid interest previously included in income), U.S. Holders
that have accrued interest or OID (to the extent thereof, if any) will recognize foreign currency gain or loss
equal to any difference between the U.S. dollar amount accrued and the U.S. dollar value of the payment
received at the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S.
source ordinary income or loss.

For purposes of this discussion, the “spot exchange rate” generally means a rate that reflects a fair
market rate of exchange available to the public for currency under a “spot contract” in a free market and
involving representative amounts. A “spot contract” is a contract to buy or sell a currency other than the U.S.
dollar on or before two business days following the date of the execution of the contract. If such a spot rate
cannot be demonstrated, the IRS has the authority to determine the spot rate. The “average rate” for an accrual
period (or partial period) is the average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of such period or
other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently applied by a U.S. Holder.

_Disposition of Senior Secured Notes_

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on a sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Senior Secured Note in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the
amount realized (less any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not
previously included in income) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. A US
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note will generally be its purchase price as determined at the
U.S. dollar value of the Euro used to purchase it at the spot exchange rate on the purchase date (or, if the
Senior Secured Notes are traded on an established securities exchange and the holder is a cash basis or an
electing accrual basis US Holder, the settlement date), increased by the U.S. dollar amount of OID included in
the US Holder’s income with respect to the Senior Secured Note, if any, and less the U.S. dollar value of any
payments previously received by the holder (other than payments of stated interest).

Gain or loss recognized on a disposition of a Senior Secured Note will generally be treated as from
U.S. source and will, except to the extent of any foreign currency gain or loss, be capital gain or loss. Payments
that are attributable to accrued interest or OID, if any, will be treated as interest or OID for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and will be treated in accordance with the rules applicable to interest and OID discussed above
under “—Interest and Original Issue Discount.” Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the U.S. Holder has held the Senior Secured Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. A noncorporate U.S. Holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are
subject to limitations.

A U.S. Holder that receives currency other than U.S. dollars upon sale, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note will realize an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the
currency on the date of sale. If the Senior Secured Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash

###### 415


-----

basis U.S. Holder or electing accrual basis taxpayer will determine the amount realized on the settlement date.
A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the currency equal to the U.S. dollar amount realized. Any gain or loss
realized by a U.S. Holder on a subsequent conversion of currency for U.S. dollars will generally be U.S. source
ordinary income or loss. Any foreign currency gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder generally will be U.S.
source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on sale or other taxable disposition
of a Senior Secured Note equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Note on the date of acquisition and the date of disposition (or, if the Senior Secured Notes are
traded on an established securities exchange and the U.S. Holder is a cash basis or an electing accrual basis
holder, the settlement date). In addition, upon the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior
Secured Note, a U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss attributable to amounts received with
respect to accrued and unpaid interest and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under
“—Interest and Original Issue Discount.” Foreign currency gain or loss cannot exceed overall gain or loss
realized on a disposition of the Senior Secured Note. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source
ordinary income or loss.

_Senior PIK Notes_

_Characterization of the Senior PIK Notes_

The Senior PIK Note Issuer intends to take the position that the Senior PIK Note Issuer and each U.S.
Holder are entitled to account for the Senior PIK Notes using a payment schedule in which it is assumed the
Senior PIK Note Issuer has elected to pay all stated interest on the Senior PIK Notes as Cash Interest rather than
as PIK Interest and that the Senior PIK Notes accordingly are not subject to the CPDI rules. This assumption
regarding accrued interest being paid as Cash Interest is made solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
does not constitute a representation by the Senior PIK Note Issuer regarding the likelihood that interest on the
Senior PIK Notes will be paid as Cash Interest or PIK Interest.

Moreover, in certain circumstances, the Senior PIK Note Issuer may be obligated to make payments in
excess of stated interest (including PIK Interest, if any) and the principal of the Senior PIK Notes and/or redeem
the Senior PIK Notes in advance of their stated maturity. All or a portion of the Senior PIK Notes may be
redeemed prior to their stated maturity at redemption prices equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
relevant Senior PIK Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest (paid at the rate of Cash Interest) to the
redemption date and additional amounts, if any, plus either (i) a “make-whole” premium or (ii) a premium over
their principal amount, as described under “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Optional Redemption.” In
addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the holders of the Senior PIK
Notes will have the right to require the Senior PIK Note Issuer to offer to repurchase the Senior PIK Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase as described under “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—Change of
_Control.” The rules applicable to debt instruments with payment contingencies are unclear. In general, if the_
amount or timing of any payment on a debt instrument is contingent and the amount or the contingency is
neither remote nor incidental, the debt instrument could be subject to special rules that apply to CPDIs. The
Senior PIK Note Issuer intends to take the position that the occurrence of such events is remote and that,
therefore, the possibility of such payments does not result in the Senior PIK Notes being treated as CPDIs for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Senior PIK Note Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such holder discloses that it is
taking a contrary position on a statement attached to its tax return in the manner required by applicable U.S.
Treasury regulations. The Senior PIK Note Issuer’s position is not, however, binding on the IRS and if the IRS
were successfully to assert, and a court were to sustain, a contrary position, U.S. Holders would be required to
accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated rate for Cash Interest, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s
accounting method and gain realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the Senior PIK Notes would be
treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Senior
PIK Notes will not be treated as CPDIs. Prospective purchasers of the Senior PIK Notes should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the treatment of the Senior PIK Notes as CPDIs..

_Interest and Original Issue Discount on Senior PIK Notes_

The Senior PIK Notes will be treated as being issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes
because no portion of the stated interest on the Senior PIK Notes is unconditionally payable in cash at least
annually and, therefore, no stated interest payments on the Senior PIK Notes will be treated as qualified stated
interest for purposes of determining the amount of OID. As a result, the Senior PIK Notes will be treated as
issued with OID in an amount equal to the excess of the sum of all payments of principal and stated interest on
the Senior PIK Notes (initially taking into account the assumption that Cash Interest will be paid, as described
above) over their issue price (the initial price at which a substantial amount of the Senior PIK Notes are first sold
to the public (excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents, brokers or similar persons)).

###### 416


-----

A U.S. Holder of Senior PIK Notes must accrue the OID into income on a constant yield to maturity
basis whether or not it receives cash payments. A U.S. Holder generally must include in income accrued OID.
The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID
allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” for a debt instrument issued with OID may be of any
length and may vary in length over the term of the debt instrument, provided that each accrual period is no
longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final
day of an accrual period. OID for any accrual period will be determined in Euro and then translated into U.S.
dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual method U.S. Holder, as described below.

The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount
equal to the product of the Senior PIK Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period and
its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between
the amount payable at maturity and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. The
“adjusted issue price” of a note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by
the accrued OID for each prior accrual period, and reduced by all payments, if any, previously made on the
Senior PIK Note. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder will generally have to include in income increasingly greater
amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.

Any payment of PIK Interest will not be treated as a payment of interest on the Senior PIK Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, any PIK Interest paid on a Senior PIK Note will be treated together
with the Senior PIK Note as a single note for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

As discussed above under “—Characterization of the Senior PIK Notes,” for purposes of calculating the
yield to maturity of the Senior PIK Notes, the Senior PIK Note Issuer intends to take the position that the Senior
PIK Note Issuer and each holder are entitled to assume initially that all of the interest on the Senior PIK Notes
will be paid in cash. This assumption is made solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and does not
constitute a representation regarding the likelihood that the Senior PIK Note Issuer will pay Cash Interest. If,
contrary to this assumption, the Senior PIK Note Issuer pays PIK Interest in any period, then solely for the
purposes of determining the amount of OID on the Senior PIK Notes going forward, the Senior PIK Notes will
be treated as retired and reissued on the date on which the Senior PIK Note Issuer pays such PIK Interest for an
amount equal to their then adjusted issue price, and the yield to maturity of the Senior PIK Notes will be
redetermined taking into account the change in circumstances. In such event, the deemed reissued Senior PIK
Notes could be retested for the application of the CPDI rules and could be subject to the CPDI rules. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the payment
of PIK Interest.

A cash basis U.S. Holder receiving a payment of Cash Interest or accrued OID in Euro must include in
income a U.S. dollar amount based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt whether or not the
payment is converted to U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder (and a cash basis U.S. Holder accruing OID)
generally must include in income a U.S. dollar amount based on the average exchange rate during the accrual
period (or, for an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial accrual period within each taxable
year). An accrual basis U.S. Holder (and a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to OID) may elect to translate
accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day
of the first taxable year for the initial portion of an accrual period that spans two taxable years) or, with respect
to interest received within five business days of the last day of an interest accrual period, the spot exchange
rate on the date of receipt. Currency translation elections apply to all debt instruments that the electing U.S.
Holder holds or acquires, and they cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Upon receipt of a payment in Euro (including, upon sale of a Senior PIK Note, the receipt of proceeds
which include accrued OID and accrued, unpaid interest previously included in income), U.S. Holders that have
accrued interest or OID (to the extent thereof, if any) will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to any
difference between the U.S. dollar amount accrued and the U.S. dollar value of the payment received at the
spot exchange rate on the date of receipt. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ordinary
income or loss.

_Disposition of Senior PIK Notes_

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on a sale, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Senior PIK Note in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the
amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior PIK Note.

###### 417


-----

A US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Senior PIK Note will generally be its purchase price as
determined at the U.S. dollar value of the Euro used to purchase it at the spot exchange rate on the purchase
date (or, if the Senior PIK Notes are traded on an established securities exchange and the holder is a cash basis
or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder, the settlement date), increased by the U.S. dollar amount of OID
included in the U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Senior PIK Note, if any, and less the U.S. dollar value of
any payments of Cash Interest previously received by the holder.

Although not free from doubt, if the Senior PIK Note Issuer pays PIK Interest on a Senior PIK Note, a
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior PIK Note should be allocated between such Senior PIK Note and
any PIK Notes received in connection with the payment of PIK Interest in proportion to their relative principal
amounts. A U.S. Holder’s holding period in any such PIK Note would likely be identical to its holding period for
the original Senior PIK Note with respect to which the PIK Note was received.

Gain or loss recognized on a disposition of a Senior PIK Note will generally be treated as from U.S.
source and will, except to the extent of any foreign currency gain or loss, be capital gain or loss. Payments that
are attributable to accrued OID, if any, will be treated as OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will be
treated in accordance with the rules applicable to OID discussed above under “—Original Issue Discount on the
_Senior PIK Notes.” Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the_
Senior PIK Notes for more than one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder’s long-term
capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.

A U.S. Holder that receives currency other than U.S. dollars upon sale, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Senior PIK Note will realize an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency on
the date of sale. If the Senior PIK Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder
or electing accrual basis taxpayer will determine the amount realized on the settlement date. A U.S. Holder will
have a tax basis in the currency equal to the U.S. dollar amount realized. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S.
Holder on a subsequent conversion of currency for U.S. dollars will generally be U.S. source ordinary income or
loss. Any foreign currency gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder generally will be U.S. source ordinary income
or loss.

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on sale or other taxable disposition
of a Senior PIK Note equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Senior
PIK Note on the date of acquisition and the date of disposition (or, if the Senior PIK Notes are traded on an
established securities exchange and the U.S. Holder is a cash basis or an electing accrual basis holder, the
settlement date). In addition, upon the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior PIK Note, a
U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to
accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Original Issue Discount on the Senior PIK
_Notes.” Foreign currency gain or loss cannot exceed overall gain or loss realized on a disposition of the Senior_
PIK Note. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

_IPO Debt Pushdown_

In connection with a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”), we may issue a notice to the Trustees (a
“Pushdown Notice”) requiring that, among other matters, the terms of the relevant Notes Documents shall
operate with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice on the basis that references to the
relevant Issuer, TopCo and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to our Restricted
Subsidiary or Parent Entity that will or has issued shares, or whose shares are to be or were sold, pursuant to
that IPO Event (the “IPO Pushdown Entity”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, including that each
reference in the Indentures or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the
relevant Issuer shall be deemed to be a reference to such IPO Pushdown Entity (such change in terms, an “IPO
Debt Pushdown”) and the restricted group shall consist of the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (the “Pushdown Group”). In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, and
each Guarantor or security provider that is not a member of the Pushdown Group would be released from its
obligations under the applicable Indenture and the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the covenants under
the Indentures governing the Notes will no longer apply to such entities. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—IPO Debt Pushdown”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO_
_Debt Pushdown” and “Description of the Senior PIK Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown.”_

Such change in the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
deemed exchange of the originally issued Notes for new Notes, which would generally be treated as a taxable
exchange for such purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain
or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with OID. In such event, noteholders that are subject to U.S. federal
income tax would be required to include the OID in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash

-----

corresponding to such income. Noteholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax should consult their
own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the
Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown.

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

Payments of interest and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of a Note may be
reported to the IRS unless the holder is a corporation or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption. Backup
withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal
income tax returns. A holder can claim a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability for the amount of any
backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess.

Certain rules may require individual U.S. Holders to report to the IRS information with respect to Notes
not held through an account with certain financial institutions. Investors who fail to report required information
could become subject to substantial penalties. Potential investors should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the possible implications of these rules for their investment in Notes.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT
MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO
CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE
NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS

European Union

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 848/2015 on insolvency proceedings (as amended, the
“Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000, the court which shall
have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member
state of the European Union (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main
interests” at the time the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The determination of where such
company has its “center of main interests” is generally a question of fact on which the courts of different EU
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Under Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation, a court that is requested to open insolvency proceedings shall examine, of its own motion, whether
it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static, but rather a fact and circumstances-based concept
and may hence change from time to time. In accordance with Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation the center of main interests shall be the place where such company conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties and there is a rebuttable presumption,
in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the place of its registered office is its center of main interests.
Factors such as the location where board meetings are held and the location where the company conducts the
majority of its business, with a special focus on the perception of the company’s creditors of the local center of
the company’s business operations, may all be relevant in determining whether such proof to the contrary can
be established.

If the center of main interests of such company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be
entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to
be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
opened in another Member State in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such
other Member State. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
located in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other
Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of
such issuer or guarantor under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions,
be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction
for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

In the event that the Issuer or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of
the obligations of the Issuer and the collateral provided by the Issuer or any other company. The insolvency,
administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate
may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency
laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

The concept of “group proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation with
the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of
companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be
requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by
an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group.
Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s
recommendations or plan, however, is voluntary.

Germany

_Insolvency_

The Issuers and certain Guarantors, are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered
offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. Consequently, under Article 3(1)
of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, absent any change in circumstances, the Issuers’ and certain
Guarantors’ center of main interests at the time of an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings

(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is likely to be in Germany, and insolvency proceedings are likely to be initiated in
Germany, in which case German insolvency law would govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws of
Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in
respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as security interests and
the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the
notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of
companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there
exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be
legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no
consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also no pooling of
claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the
handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which
entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation
between insolvency proceedings of group companies as well as the concentration of proceedings at the same
court. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group
companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims
amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German
Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be
competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency
administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on
insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for
“coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency
administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of overindebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and
when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their
liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely for a prognosis period
covering the next twelve months (positive Fortführungsprognose). The management of a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH), a European law stock corporation based in Germany
(Societas Europaea—SE) or a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or any other company not having
an individual as personally liable shareholder and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to
file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest (i) within 3 weeks
after the mandatory insolvency reason of, illiquidity occurred and (ii) within 6 weeks after the mandatory
insolvency reason of over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes
management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In particular, once
illiquidity or over-indebtedness has occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, may be
voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under
German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will
presumably (predominantly likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain
prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, in the case of imminent illiquidity only the
debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in
the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID 19 Pandemic, which was adopted on 27 March 2020 (as
amended from time to time, the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for
insolvency until, currently, April 30, 2021. The suspension—as in force from January 1, 2021—applies to debtors
who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, have applied for financial assistance under
state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or have been prevented,
as eligible debtors, from filing such application for legal or factual reasons, unless the insolvency is not caused
by consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial
assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the over-indebtedness or illiquidity.
The COVInsAG also provides for a certain relief from claw back provisions, if the debtor fulfilled the
requirements for the suspension of filing duties, for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for
these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and
refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the
meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Furthermore,

###### 421


-----

for an interim period until December 31, 2021, the COVInsAG reduces the forecast period
(Fortführungsprognose) relevant for determining whether a continuation of the debtor’s business is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for the purposes of the assessment of the insolvency
ground of over-indebtedness from twelve months to four months provided that the debtor’s overindebtedness is caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which is assumed if (i) the debtor was not cash-flow
insolvent as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the
last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in
calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the
due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will
also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has
petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s
management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision
of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that, inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent selfadministration plan (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to the petition for the debtor-in-possession status and no
circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on
inaccurate facts. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may
appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on the profile of the
officeholder to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the
court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such
suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., incompetent and/or not
impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor
constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for the
small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in
particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of the business
carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s
net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening
(Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements
are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the
assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency
proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such
advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of
assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not
necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency
court unless a debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of
the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being
entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’
assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by
heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency
administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, businessexperienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other
liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator
qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency
claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after
realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to
participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and
creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately but
can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Therefore,
secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings.
In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such
security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be
noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the
debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets
(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims

###### 422


-----

that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is
vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for
(i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets
(Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9%. of the gross enforcement proceeds plus
VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount
equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency
administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of
the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—
_Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to_
the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the
preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the
realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of the
Issuers or under a guarantee granted by any German guarantor in full after the secured creditors have been
satisfied. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are
satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims)
have been fully satisfied.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal
sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach
aiming at the rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan
can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject
to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with
specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the
shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan,
e.g., these can be transferred to third-parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap.
Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency
reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate
such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not
obviously futile, the court may grant a period of up to three months to utilize up an insolvency plan for the
debtor business (Schutzschirm). In addition, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, debtors have
access to the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) even in the state of illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) if such illiquidity occurred due to COVID-19. During the respective period granted by the
court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing
debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian
(Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as
custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is
obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator may avoid (anfechten) transactions,
performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior
to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. Generally, if
transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts
or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the
insolvency estate. The administrator’s right to avoid transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend
to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuers based on and governed by the
insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as the granting of
collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges
by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In case
the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is avoided successfully, you may
not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the collateral. If payments have already been made
under the Notes or collateral, the insolvency administrator may require that the recipients return the payment
to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes
without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the
granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:

    - any act granting a creditor security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be
avoided if the act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was cash flow

###### 423


-----

insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and
the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being cash
flow insolvent (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggested such cash flow
insolvency or filing);

- any act granting a creditor security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which
such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner,
can be avoided if the act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings; if the transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to
the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was cash flow insolvent,
or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor;

- any legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months
prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at
the time of the legal transaction the debtor was insolvent and the other party to the legal
transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had
knowledge thereof or of the debtor being insolvent;

- if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third party debt is regarded as having been
granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be avoided unless it was
effected earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings against the debtor;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the
intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the
beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act
granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above
ten year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of
such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in
case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors;
the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred
payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this
time;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party (nahestehende
_Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such_
contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate
entities, the term ‘affiliated party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of
the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them
access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are
spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

- any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a claim (Befriedigung) of a shareholder
for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim
can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security (Sicherung), if the transaction was effected
within the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or
thereafter or (ii) in the event it provided satisfaction (Befriedigung), if the transaction was effected
in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter;
or

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the
filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the
debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder
has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

###### 424


-----

For purposes of the above, the knowledge of circumstances from which a compelling conclusion
regarding the debtor’s insolvency or regarding the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings can be drawn, will be considered tantamount to the actual knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency
or of the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The COVInsAG, however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans
under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On
that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third- party financing and shareholder
loans by before September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant
financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for
the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of
third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the
repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically
equivalent to such a loan.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator avoiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the relevant
security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency
proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance
periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

Finally, the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors
against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims
of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual
insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence
binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and
(v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in
economic terms to such a loan.

_Restructuring Proceedings_

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which
aims to ensure that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in
financial distress to solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings
(Directive of the European Parliament and the Council (EU) 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks,
on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures
concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the
“Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further
Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021.
An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for
Enterprises (“Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal
framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany.

Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are
initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent
restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). A debtor can access the new restructuring tools
of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is predominantly likely that the debtor will not be able to meet_
its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged
to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may
alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under
“—Insolvency.”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do
not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the
Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the
debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected
liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools
available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent

###### 425


-----

restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used
without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under
the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for
each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security
provided to secure debts owed by the debtor and granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene
_Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a_
respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate
the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency.”).

The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court
restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal
amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact
(including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its
subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding
for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The
restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that
in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are
determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership
rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the
restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not
approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the
restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the
debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools
include a stabilisation order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor).
Such stabilisation order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilisation order
can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the
stabilisation order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under
the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by the Issuers, a German guarantor or any other guarantor
having its centre of main interest in Germany would be the following:

    - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or
only limited review and/or supervision by a court;

    - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a
period of up to eight months due to a stabilisation order;

    - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be
compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in
principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and
an adjustment of the ranking of the security right);

    - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral;

    - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder
of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a crossclass cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes;

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be
recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU)
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon
such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation (which has, as of
the date of this offering memorandum, not yet been initiated). In any other case, the recognition of the
restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests_

The granting of guarantees and security interests by German subsidiary guarantors is subject to
certain limitations under German law.

###### 426


-----

Any guarantee and security interest granted by a German guarantor being a direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Issuers incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung—“GmbH”) or a limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner_
(GmbH & Co. KG) is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz
_betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung—“GmbHG”)._

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s, or in
the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of
the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an
existing shortfall of, the amount of its registered share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz).
Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to secure the liabilities
of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31.
Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and security interests securing liabilities
of a direct or indirect parent or a sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect
management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees
and security documents to contain so-called—limitation language—in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in
Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
enforcement of any subsidiary guarantee and security documents given by the German subsidiary
incorporated as a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or as a German
limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) will be limited
if and to the extent payments under any such subsidiary guarantee or, as the case may be, the enforcement of
security documents would cause the German subsidiary Guarantor’s (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its
general partner’s) net assets to fall below, or increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its registered share
capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) (provided that the determination and calculation of
such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and guarantee
provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuers in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG
incorporated or established in Germany will contain such limitation language in the manner described.

Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of any guarantee and security interest granted by a
German guarantor being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuers incorporated in Germany in the form of a
stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—“AG”) or of any subsidiary of the AG are subject to certain provisions of
the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz—“AktG”).

As a general rule, section 71a of the AktG prohibits an AG such as Douglas Holding AG (and any of its
subsidiaries) from making any payment, granting any loan, any security (including any guarantee) or any other
benefit to any other person for the purpose of, with a view to or in support of, the (direct or indirect) acquisition
of any shares in the AG. According to section 71a of the AktG any transaction or agreement providing for any
such financial assistance would be held void. In addition, section 57 of the AktG prohibits an AG generally from
disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders or to its sister companies. Therefore, in order to
enable a German subsidiary incorporated as an AG or subsidiaries of an AG to grant guarantees and security
interests securing liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating
sections 57 and 71a of the AktG and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market
practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called—limitation
language—in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of an AG (such as Douglas
Holding AG) and any of the AG’s subsidiaries. Pursuant to such limitation language, the subsidiary guarantee
and security documents given by the German subsidiary incorporated as an AG or any subsidiaries of an AG do
not secure any liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company of the AG (or any of its subsidiaries)
unless the AG is subject to a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as the dominated entity (beherrschtes Unternehmen) with a direct or indirect_
shareholder or any subsidiary of such shareholder (other than the AG and the subsidiaries of the AG) as the
dominating entity (herrschendes Unternehmen). If the AG is subject to such a domination and/or profit and loss
pooling agreement as the dominated entity, payments under the subsidiary guarantee or, as the case may be,
the enforcement of security documents may be limited by reference to the dominating entity’s ability to
compensate losses of the AG under the domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement due to the
dominating entity’s solvency situation. Accordingly, any security and guarantee provided by a (direct or
indirect) subsidiary of the Issuers in the legal form of an AG incorporated in Germany and any subsidiary of the
AG will contain such limitation language in the manner described.

These limitations would, to the extent applicable, restrict the right of payment and would limit the
claim accordingly irrespective of the granting of the subsidiary guarantee or the security interests pursuant to
the security documents. In addition, subsidiary guarantees in other jurisdictions may be subject to similar
limitations.

German capital maintenance and financial assistance rules and other restrictions referred to above are
subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of

-----

shareholders to assets of the German subsidiary guarantors, which can negatively affect the ability of the
Issuers to make payment on the Notes, of the German subsidiary guarantors to make payments on the
subsidiary guarantees or of the secured parties to enforce any collateral.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG)
now contained in section 15b para 5 InsO (i.e. a situation where a managing director makes a payment to the
GmbH’s shareholder which inevitably leads to the illiquidity of the GmbH) or a so-called —“destructive
interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e. a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited
liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its payment obligations towards its creditors (or in the
case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner)) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a
subsidiary guarantee or collateral granted by the German subsidiary guarantors or security provider. In such
case, the amount of proceeds permitted or capable to be realized in an enforcement process may be (further)
reduced (up to zero). According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), inter
_alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows_
about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant
collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German
courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German subsidiary
guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of
the grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for
example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other
creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could
be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the
guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

_Accessory security interests / Parallel debt_

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of a strict accessory
nature (akzessorisch) and are therefore dependent on the corresponding secured claims and require the
security holder and the creditor of the secured claims to be identical. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged
or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in
case the relevant secured claim is assigned, and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be
secured by the accessory security interests. The accessory security interests will only be granted to the Security
Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, in contrast with
holders of the Notes (the “Holders”), who are creditors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In order to
allow the Holders to benefit from such accessory security interests, the accessory security interests will only
secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security
Agent, rather than securing the Holders’ claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees directly. The parallel
debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt, and any payment in respect of the parallel
debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to
the parallel debt, a theoretical legal claim against the Issuers and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of
the Notes and the Note Guarantees, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been
tested before a German court. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that this concept will not be
recognized by German courts or that the courts will eliminate or mitigate the validity or the enforceability of
accessory security interests, and that the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may thus be
restricted.

Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes
must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, Security grantors may have a right to claim the release
of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of security interest granted
significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can
even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive over-collateralization. As a general rule, value of collateral
should not exceed the amount of the secured obligations by more than 50%. A security transfer or assignment
violating this rule either in itself or in combination with other security interests will be deemed void if the
violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If the ratio is exceeded later as a result of partial
prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor is entitled to a
corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied
in the context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral (i.e.,
account pledges, claim pledges and share or interest pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be
taken into account. While the German Federal High Court (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a
case-by-case basis, legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of
the security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims by more than 50%.

###### 428


-----

In addition, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged
assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods and notice requirements may
apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial
owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured.
Finally, the provision of Guarantees and execution of the Collateral will be subject to certain Agreed Security
Principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or security providers of the obligation to provide guarantees
and/or grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could have a
material adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.

As a matter of applicable German law (Section 20 para. 1 of the German Transformation Act—
_Umwandlungsgesetz), upon the registration of any post-closing merger with the competent commercial_
register of the acquiring legal entity (übernehmender Rechtsträger), all assets and liabilities of the transferor
entity (übertragender Rechtsträger) transfer to the acquiring legal entity by way of universal succession
(Universalsukzession) and the transferor ceases to exist.

_Discharge of assigned receivables_

Furthermore, under conflict of laws rules, the enforceability of an assignment against the obligor of the
assigned right will typically be governed by the law applicable to the assigned right. The assignability of a claim
governed by German law may be limited because of the nature of the assigned claim or as a result of an
agreement between the creditor and the obligor thereof. Although a contractual agreement cannot validly
preclude an assignment if the assigned claim results from a transaction entered into between two commercial
parties, any payment on such claim to the assignor will extinguish such claim in a corresponding amount. As
long as the obligor of an assigned claim is not aware of the assignment, such third-party debtor is entitled to
assume that the assignor is still the creditor (e.g. the claim will extinguish if and to the extent that the debtor
pays the assignor).

Italy

_Enforcement limitations_

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

a) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement, precautionary measures or
remedy the availability of which is subject to equitable consideration or which is otherwise at
the discretion of the Court;

b) pursuant to Article 1241 and following of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of
reciprocal obligations (“compensazione”), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may
set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have
as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

c) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions
concerning advance waivers or forfeitures;

d) claims may become barred under statutes of limitation (prescrizione or decadenza) or may be
or become subject to the defence of set-off or to counterclaim, including counterclaims
related to counterparties’ default (eccezione di inadempimento);

e) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is
prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (“colpa grave”), willful misconduct
(“dolo”) or the violation of mandatory provisions;

f) to the extent that any matter is expressed to be determined by future agreement or
negotiation, the relevant provision may be unenforceable or void by reason of its uncertainty;

g) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation; and

h) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor, other than the grantee of
such security interest, from seeking attachment or continuing enforcement or enforcement
proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant security interest.

_Trust and Security Agent_

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the
relevant security document. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a
security interest can be validly created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes),

###### 429


-----

which are neither directly parties to the relevant Security Documents or are not specifically identified therein or
in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; (ii) in favor of a “trustee” on the
basis that the recent Italian law provisions on “collateral agent” (as set out under Article 2414-bis of the Italian
Civil Code) do not apply to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or (iii) where the share pledge is created and
perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as (A) joint and several creditor under “parallel
debt” or similar arrangements or (B) agent (“mandatario con rappresentanza”) of the holders of the Notes,
considering that the holders of the Notes (x) are not expected to be direct parties to the relevant Italian law
governed Security Document, (y) may not be specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates
and corporate documents or public registers and (z) may change over time without any share pledge
confirmation and extension deed being entered into from time to time. Therefore, there is a risk that an Italian
court may determine that the holders of the Notes are not secured by the security under the Italian law
governed share pledge and/or cannot enforce that security.

Poland

The obligations under the Note Guarantees and security interests granted by any Guarantor
incorporated in Poland (the “Polish subsidiary guarantor”) and satisfaction of creditors’ claims under the Note
Guarantees are subject to limitations resulting from the application of the bankruptcy laws, as set out in the
Polish Bankruptcy Act (Prawo Upadłos´ciowe) of February 28, 2003 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1228, as
amended) (the “Polish Bankruptcy Law”) and the restructuring laws, as set out in the Polish Restructuring Act
(Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of May 15, 2015 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 814, as amended) (the “Polish
Restructuring Law”), as well as limitations resulting from provisions regarding protection of share capital as
further described under the heading “Other Issues Concerning the Limitations and Effectiveness of the Note
_Guarantees” below._

_Insolvency and Insolvency Threat_

If a Polish subsidiary guarantor’s “center of main interests” (about which see further the section
“European Union” above) is in Poland, then pursuant to Polish Bankruptcy Law and EU Insolvency Regulation,
bankruptcy proceedings of the Polish subsidiary guarantor should be conducted before a Polish court.
Consequently, in the event of the insolvency of such Polish subsidiary guarantor, insolvency proceedings would
be governed by Polish law. Similarly, in the event of such Polish subsidiary guarantor’s insolvency or its threat,
restructuring proceedings would also be subject to Polish law.

According to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Polish subsidiary guarantor will be declared bankrupt if it
is insolvent. The Polish subsidiary guarantor as a debtor will be insolvent: (i) if it has lost its ability to fulfill its
due pecuniary liabilities (wymagalne zobowia˛zania pienie˛ z˙ne) (cash flow test). The inability to fulfill the due
pecuniary liabilities is presumed to arise, if the delay in fulfilling pecuniary obligations exceeds three months),
or (ii) its pecuniary liabilities (except for future liabilities and those to shareholders relating to loans and legal
acts of similar effect, granted within five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the total value of its
assets (except for assets not constituting the bankruptcy estate) and such situation persists for longer than 24
months (balance sheet test). It is presumed that the pecuniary liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets if,
according to the balance sheet, its liabilities (except for reserves for liabilities and liabilities to affiliates) exceed
the value of its assets and such situation persists beyond 24 months.

Despite meeting the balance sheet test by the Polish subsidiary guarantor, the Polish Bankruptcy Law
allows the court dismissing an application for bankruptcy if there is no threat of losing ability by the Polish
subsidiary guarantor to fulfill its due pecuniary liabilities in near future.

Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish subsidiary guarantor (whether individually or
jointly) is obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish subsidiary guarantor bankrupt within 30 days from when
the grounds for declaration of bankruptcy above are met.

###### 430

Under the Anti-Crisis Act Regarding COVID-19 (Ustawa z dnia 2 marca 2020 r. o szczególnych
_rozwia˛zaniach zwia˛zanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdziałaniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chorób_
_zakaz´nych oraz wywołanych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych) of March 2, 2020 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1842, as_
amended), debtors whose insolvency occurred between 14 March 2020 and the date on which the state of
epidemiological threat or epidemic in Poland was cancelled, are temporarily exempt from the obligation to file
a petition for bankruptcy if their insolvency was due to COVID-19 (it is presumed that the insolvency was a
result of COVID-19 if it arose during the state of epidemiological threat or epidemic). After cancellation of the
state of epidemiological threat or epidemic, the 30-day deadline for filing a petition for bankruptcy shall run
anew.

Additionally, the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s personal creditors may file for bankruptcy of the Polish
subsidiary guarantor.

According to the Polish Restructuring Law, restructuring proceedings may be opened in respect of the
Polish subsidiary guarantor as debtor if it is insolvent or will be threatened with insolvency, i.e., if its commercial
position shows that it may become insolvent within a short period of time.

If the Polish subsidiary guarantor is insolvent or threatened with insolvency, it may file a restructuring
motion. If the Polish subsidiary guarantor is insolvent, a restructuring motion to open remedial proceedings
may be filed by the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s personal creditors.

If a motion for declaration of bankruptcy and motion for opening restructuring proceedings have both
been filed, the court should first decide on the restructuring motion and put on hold the proceedings on the
motion for bankruptcy (unless putting them on hold would be against the interests of all creditors). The debtor
cannot be declared bankrupt during restructuring proceedings.

_Bankruptcy Proceedings_

The principal aim of bankruptcy proceedings is the satisfaction of the creditors from the proceeds
obtained from the sale of the debtor’s assets. In the event of bankruptcy proceedings, the court appoints a
bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) who takes over the management of the bankrupt’s assets. From this moment on,
the management of a debtor–bankrupt entity is replaced by the bankruptcy receiver who administers the
bankrupt entity’s assets and represents the bankrupt entity. The bankrupt entity’s assets become bankruptcy
assets which will be liquidated to pay off creditors. The composition of bankruptcy assets is determined during
preparation of the inventory list and creditors’ receivables list which are prepared by the bankruptcy receiver. A
motion for approval of the terms of sale of the debtor’s enterprise or its organized part, or substantial part of its
assets, may be appended to the petition to commence bankruptcy proceedings (pre-packaged liquidation).

Upon the bankruptcy declaration all of the debtor’s debts become due and payable and
non-pecuniary debts are converted to pecuniary and become due and payable. Interest may be paid from the
bankruptcy estate only for the period up to the date of the declaration of bankruptcy, unless they are secured
by mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages, and satisfied from
the security assets’ proceeds.

The bankrupt’s claim may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the date of
declaration of bankruptcy, regardless of whether the claims have not yet become due and payable. A set-off is
not admissible if the bankrupt’s debtor acquired the claim by assignment or endorsement after bankruptcy was
declared or acquired it during the year preceding the date of declaration of bankruptcy, while being aware that
there were grounds for declaring bankruptcy. However, this limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has
become the bankrupt’s creditor as a result of repaying the bankrupt’s debt, for which it was liable personally or
with certain property items, and if the acquirer was not aware of the existence of grounds for declaring
bankruptcy at the time of assuming liability for the bankrupt’s debt or (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one
year before the date on which bankruptcy was declared. The set off is also not admissible if bankrupt’s creditor
become bankrupt’s debtor after the date of declaration of bankruptcy. The sum proposed to be set off on the
part of the bankrupt is the total of the bankrupt’s claim and on the part of the creditor it is the creditor’s
principal claim only, along with interests accrued until the date of declaration bankruptcy. If the bankrupt’s debt
without interest had not become due and payable by the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the sum to be
set-off is the amount due reduced by statutory interest (which may not exceed six percent) between the date of
declaration of bankruptcy until the date of payment, and may not exceed two years. A creditor wishing to
exercise the set-off right must make a statement in this respect not later than when submitting the claim.

Once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject to security, charged with
a pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers
may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such
entry had been filed at least six months prior to filing the motion for bankruptcy.

###### 431


-----

Provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party which explicitly stipulate that the
agreement is amended or terminated in the case its bankruptcy (or filing for it) are invalid. Also, provisions of
an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the bankruptcy
proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate. These
specific provisions of Polish Bankruptcy Law are deemed to apply also to contracts that are subject to laws
other than the laws of Poland, as long as the provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is subject
to bankruptcy proceedings under the Polish Bankruptcy Law.

If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy declaration
in any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. In particular, in the bankruptcy
proceedings, unless separate statutory laws provide otherwise, proceedings initiated against the bankrupt
before the date of declaration of bankruptcy concerning a claim which was submitted within the bankruptcy
proceedings may be continued only if this claim has not been included in the list of claims (see below) once
this list was finalised. If proceedings were pending in which the bankrupt entity was the plaintiff, the bankruptcy
receiver replaces the bankrupt entity. If enforcement proceedings regarding the claims which may be
submitted within the bankruptcy proceedings were pending against the bankrupt entity on the day of
bankruptcy declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and
proceeds received are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after the decision on the declaration of bankruptcy
becomes final. If the arbitration proceedings were not commenced on the date of declaration of bankruptcy,
the bankruptcy receiver may with the consent of the judge—commissioner renounce the arbitration clauses if
the arbitration proceedings hinder the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate. If the bankruptcy receiver
renounces the arbitration clause it expires.

Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring
bankruptcy. Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of claims. If a
claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal.. Under the Polish Bankruptcy Law, any
debt payable in a currency other than Polish złoty, if being put on the list of claims, must be converted into
Polish złoty according to the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate prevailing on the date the
bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen
due or not).

In the bankruptcy proceedings, creditors under the Note Guarantees will be satisfied from the
proceeds obtained from the sale of the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s assets if their claim under the Note
Guarantees is due and payable, otherwise the proceeds of that sale will be deposited in the court deposit in
their favor and released once their claim under the Note Guarantees becomes due and payable and not
satisfied.

As a rule, Polish subsidiary guarantor’s debts are divided into four categories and creditors whose
receivables are ranked in a lower category cannot be satisfied before all the debts in the higher category have
been fully satisfied. The first category principally includes payments to the state or employees (remuneration,
health benefit payments and social security obligations, etc.) or related to the restructuring proceedings
(including arising under a credit facility, loan, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit, or other form of financing
envisaged in the arrangement concluded in the restructuring proceedings and provided in connection with the
arrangement’s performance). Most unsecured commercial debts, tax and other public dues are listed in the
second category. The third category encompasses interest on debts in the first and second categories (in the
order in which the principal is satisfied), court or administrative penalties, donations etc. The fourth category
concerns debts to direct and certain indirect shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect that
were granted within five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy including interest accrued thereon. Within
a category, each creditor’s receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in that category.
Before satisfying any claims, the bankruptcy receiver covers the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and the
liabilities of the bankruptcy estate.

The Polish Bankruptcy Law does not require a bankruptcy receiver to give effect to intercreditor
arrangements such as subordination agreements. Although the law does not preclude creditors from
attempting to enforce such rights in separate proceedings based on their entitlements arising from respective
contracts, such proceedings are conducted outside of and following bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, the
claims of all unsecured creditors may be paid on a pari passu basis in bankruptcy proceedings.

If an asset owned by the bankrupt entity (the Polish subsidiary guarantor) is encumbered with a
mortgage, pledge, registry pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage, then a creditor has a right to be
satisfied from that asset before other creditors (with a few exceptions such as, for instance, a certain portion of
employee salaries). Where a number of mortgages or pledges have been established on a real estate or the
object of the pledge, creditors are repaid from according to their priority. The pledgee under the registered
pledge or financial pledge may seize the pledged object if the relevant pledge agreement provides for such
method of satisfaction of creditor’s claim. However, seizure is not allowed if such object is the part of bankrupt’s
enterprise and the sale of such object with the rest of the enterprise is more beneficial than its separate sale.

###### 432


-----

In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, an arrangement between the debtor and creditors can
be voted on and approved by the creditors. In such case after the approval by the court, the provisions of the
arrangement determine the manner of satisfaction of creditors’ receivables. If the repayment of receivables
arising under the Note Guarantees are covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that such receivables
may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain
mandatory rules of the Polish Bankruptcy Law).

A creditor who fails to satisfy his claim during bankruptcy proceedings may try to raise this claim
directly against persons acting on behalf of the Polish subsidiary guarantor being a limited liability company.
Pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000
(Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1526, as amended) (the “Polish Commercial Companies Code”) if enforcement
against a company proves to be ineffective, members of the management board of a limited liability company
shall be jointly and severally liable for the company’s liabilities. A member of the management board may be
discharged from liability referred to above if he proves that the bankruptcy petition was filed in a timely manner
or in the appropriate time the decision on the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the approval of the
arrangement in the approval arrangement proceedings were issued, or that a failure to file a bankruptcy
petition occurred through no fault on his part or that despite the failure to file a bankruptcy petition or to issue
the decision on the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the decision on the approval the arrangement
in the approval arrangement proceedings, the creditor suffered no additional damage.

_Restructuring Proceedings_

Restructuring proceedings essentially aim to avoid the debtor’s bankruptcy through its debt
restructuring under an arrangement with creditors and, in the event of remedial proceedings (poste˛ powanie
_sanacyjne), also through remedial steps, while securing the justified rights of creditors._

Restructuring proceedings may be initiated by a debtor’s motion, or, in case of remedial proceedings
also on a debtor’s personal creditor’s motion, if the debtor is insolvent or threatened with insolvency. The court
will refuse to open restructuring proceedings, if they are detrimental to creditors, or, in case of arrangement
proceedings (poste˛ powanie układowe) and remedial proceedings if the debtor’s ability to fund the costs of
such proceedings and obligations arising after the date of opening of these proceedings cannot be
substantiated.

The debtor may request the opening of one of the four following restructuring proceedings:
(i) approval arrangement proceedings, (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings; (iii) arrangement
proceedings and (iv) remedial proceedings.

In addition, in relation to COVID-19, on June 24, 2020, a new simplified restructuring proceeding
entered into force and will be available until 30 June 2021. There are legislative work carried out to incorporate
the simplified restructuring proceeding (with some amendments) to the Polish Restructuring Law.

In the case of approval arrangement proceedings, the debtor solicits votes from creditors on a
proposed arrangement without participation of the court. Once creditors have cast a sufficient number of
votes, the debtor may apply to the court for approval of the arrangement. This type of proceedings is available
when the sum of the disputed claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims.

Accelerated arrangement proceedings are designed to allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement
with the creditors following the preparation of a list of creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge–
commissioner in simplified proceedings. The procedure may be applied provided that the sum of disputed
claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims. At the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings, the
debtor’s assets constitute the arrangement estate. The arrangement estate is administered by the debtor,
unless the court decides that an administrator should be appointed (e.g. if the debtor fails to perform the
instructions of the judge–commissioner or the court supervisor). From the opening of accelerated arrangement
proceedings, the debtor or administrator (if appointed) cannot satisfy any creditors’ receivable which is
covered by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement proceedings concerning the claims to be
covered by the arrangement are stayed by the operation of law.

In arrangement proceedings, an arrangement may be concluded following the preparation of the list
of creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge-commissioner in ordinary proceedings. This procedure
may be used when the sum of the disputed claims exceeds 15% of the total claims. As in accelerated
arrangement proceedings, the assets of the debtor form the arrangement estate, which is administered by the
debtor or administrator (if appointed). The debtor, or administrator (if appointed) also may not satisfy any debt
which is covered by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement proceedings concerning the
claims to be covered by the arrangement are also stayed by the operation of law.

###### 433


-----

Remedial proceedings allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement with creditors and undertake
various remedial actions which aim to improve the economic situation of the debtor and restore the debtor’s
capacity to perform his obligations. At the opening of remedial proceedings, the debtor is deprived of its right
to administer its assets (from the opening of proceedings they constitute the remedial estate) and the assets
are administered by a court-appointed administrator (unless the court allows the debtor to retain the right to
administer the remedial estate). The administrator can undertake a number of restructuring steps, including
renouncing a not performed mutual agreement, or challenging the effectiveness of certain acts undertaken by
the debtor before filing the motion to open remedial proceedings. Upon opening of the remedial
proceedings, the debtor or administrator are legally prohibited from making payments to satisfy claims which
are covered by the arrangement. The enforcement proceedings are also stayed by the operation of law.

The claim of the company which is subject to restructuring may be set off against a creditor’s claim if
both claims existed on the date of opening of restructuring proceedings (other than the approval arrangement
proceedings). However, the set-off is not admissible if (i) the creditor became a debtor or the debtor after the
opening of the restructuring proceedings or (ii) the debtor of the company subject to restructuring acquired
the claim against the company subject to restructuring by assignment or endorsement after opening of the
restructuring proceedings and such claim came into existence prior to the opening of the restructuring
proceedings. This limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become the creditor of company subject to
restructuring as a result of repaying such company’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain
property items, and (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date of opening of the
restructuring proceedings. Similarly, the set off is not permissible if the creditor of the company subject to
restructuring become a debtor of such company after the opening of the restructuring proceedings. A creditor
wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement within 30 days from opening of the restructuring
proceedings and if the grounds for set off arose after that date, then within 30 days from arising of the ground
for set off.

Once the accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings or remedial proceedings
are opened, the entity’s assets may not be encumbered with security, charged with a pledge, registry pledge
or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to establish
any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had been filed at least six
months prior to filing the motion for opening of the proceedings.

Additionally, provisions of an agreement to which the debtor is a party which explicitly stipulate that
the agreement is amended or terminated in the case of opening restructuring proceedings (or filing for it)
(except for approval arrangement proceedings) are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the
debtor is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the restructuring proceedings from being achieved will be
deemed ineffective in relation to the arrangement or remedial estate (as applicable). These specific provisions
of the Polish Restructuring Law are deemed to apply also to contracts that are subject to laws other than the
laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is subject to
restructuring proceedings (other than approval arrangement proceedings) under the Polish Restructuring Law.

If the arrangement proceedings or accelerated arrangement proceedings are opened with respect to
the Polish subsidiary guarantor, then certain actions in court proceedings against the Polish subsidiary
guarantor will require court supervisor’s consent. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables which
are subject to arrangement were pending against the Polish subsidiary guarantor on the day of opening of
such restructuring proceedings, they are suspended with effect from the opening of such proceedings and
proceeds received are transferred to the arrangement estate after the issuance of decision on opening of the
restructuring proceedings. The creditor secured with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge
and/or maritime mortgage can conduct the enforcement only with respect to the object of such security
interest. The court may also stay enforcement of the claim which is not subject to the arrangement for the
period of up to three months if such enforcement concerns the object which is necessary to run Polish
subsidiary guarantor’s enterprise.

In the case of opening of the remedial proceedings against the Polish subsidiary guarantor, if
proceedings were pending in which the Polish subsidiary guarantor was the plaintiff, the administrator replaces
the Polish subsidiary guarantor. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables were pending against
the Polish subsidiary guarantor on the day of opening of the remedial proceeding, they are suspended and
proceeds received are transferred to the remedial estate after the issuance of decision on the opening of the
remedial proceedings.

If creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and then approved by the
court. The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed against. An approved arrangement is
binding on (affects) all creditors, whose receivables are covered by the arrangement. Certain receivables are
not covered (affected) by the arrangement. These include, among other things: (i) receivables secured with
mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages, however only up to the

###### 434


-----

value of the collateral (to the extent they can be satisfied from the security assets on which such security was
established); a creditor whose claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject to arrangement,
(ii) receivables under derivative or repo transactions, and (iii) receivables under employment contracts.

The arrangement may also concern only certain types of receivables (partial arrangement). In such
case, the arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors who have receivables of such type. In a partial
arrangement, there are several exceptions to the general rule that receivables secured by mortgages, pledges,
registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages are not covered by the arrangement, without
the consent of the creditor, up to the value of the collateral. The consent of the creditor is not required, if the
arrangement’s initial proposals envisage full satisfaction of the creditor within the timeframe specified in the
arrangement, or if they envisage satisfaction to an extent not less than may be expected from the collateral.

If the receivables arising under the Note Guarantees are covered by the arrangement, there is a
possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions
would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Restructuring Law).

A simplified restructuring proceeding is a hybrid of solutions provided for in other restructuring
proceedings. It is for the most part extrajudicial and refers to the approval arrangement proceedings regulated
in the Polish Restructuring Law, but with significant modifications. A simplified restructuring proceeding is
opened automatically by publishing an announcement in the judicial and commercial gazette Monitor Sa˛dowy i
_Gospodarczy, indicating the debtor’s details, the arrangement date, and the arrangement supervisor. Before_
making an announcement, the debtor prepares and submits to the selected arrangement supervisor
arrangement proposals, a list of claims, and a list of disputed claims. As in the approval arrangement
proceedings, the debtor, with the help of a restructuring adviser, presents creditors with arrangement
proposals, collects their votes and, only at the end, applies to the court for approval of the arrangement, which
has already been voted on. A creditors’ meeting to vote on the arrangement may be conducted remotely using
electronic communications. The application for approval of the arrangement must be submitted to the court no
later than four months after the announcement in Monitor Sa˛dowy i Gospodarczy. If no application for approval
is filed within this period, the proceedings will be discontinued by operation of law.

During the period from the date of making an announcement on opening the simplified restructuring
procedure to the date of completion or discontinuance, existing enforcement proceedings are suspended by
operation of law and no new proceedings may be instigated against the debtor. In addition, during the period
of simplified restructuring, it is prohibited to terminate key agreements concluded with the debtor, including
rental, tenancy, leasing or loan agreements, without the arrangement supervisor’s permission. There is also a
ban, known from the accelerated arrangement procedure, on payment of claims covered by the arrangement
by operation of law, as well as restrictions on setoff. Another new feature is the possibility to include in the
arrangement a claim secured against the debtor’s assets without the secured creditor’s consent.

Any creditor may apply to the court for lifting in its entirety of the effects of the announcement of the
opening of a simplified restructuring proceeding, including the prohibition of enforcement against the debtor’s
assets. Creditors will also be entitled to pursue a claim for redress of damages if the debtor made an
announcement on the opening of proceedings in bad faith.

_Limitations and Effectiveness of the Note Guarantees in Bankruptcy or Restructuring Proceedings_

Pursuant to Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law, a corporate entity is deemed to be insolvent
if its pecuniary liabilities (except for future liabilities and those to shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of
similar effect, granted within five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the total value of its assets
(except for assets not constituting the bankruptcy estate) and such situation persists for longer than 24 months.
Given certain legal controversies regarding the application of this rule, and in order to mitigate the possibility
that the Polish subsidiary guarantor could be declared bankrupt under this rule, the liability of any Polish
subsidiary guarantor on account of payments under the Note Guarantees shall be limited to the amount
equivalent to the Polish subsidiary guarantor’s assets (except for assets which do not form part of the estate
subject to bankruptcy). This limitation of liability will no longer apply when the Polish subsidiary guarantor
becomes insolvent in the meaning of Article 11 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law or upon acceleration of the
receivables under the Note Guarantees (in spite of the previous application of that limitation of liability).

Under the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Note Guarantees may be declared ineffective or deemed to be
ineffective in certain situations. In particular, the enforceability of the receivables arising under the Note
Guarantees in the insolvency proceedings depends on whether it was granted at least six months before the
filing of the motion for bankruptcy of the Polish subsidiary guarantor and, furthermore, whether the secured
receivables are due and payable. Pursuant to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, if: (i) the debt secured by the Note
Guarantees is not due (dług niewymagalny); and (ii) the Note Guarantees were granted within six months
before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy, then it will be deemed ineffective. However, in such case, the

###### 435


-----

creditor may bring an action or charge in order to seek the recognition of the Note Guarantees as effective if at
the time when the same was granted the creditor was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaration of
bankruptcy of the grantor.

Furthermore, if the Note Guarantees are granted within six months preceding the date of the filing of
the motion for bankruptcy, it will be assessed whether the Note Guarantees in this state of facts was granted by
the bankrupt entity to its partners or shareholders, their representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates,
their partners or shareholders, representatives, or spouses of the same as well as with another company, in the
event of either being the controlling company. If so, the Note Guarantees will be declared ineffective towards
the bankruptcy estate, unless the other party is able to prove that it is not detrimental to other creditors.

The disposals made by the bankrupt in respect of its estate (czynnos´ci prawne, którymi upadły
_rozporza˛dził swoim maja˛tkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy will be deemed_
ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if the value of the disposal significantly (raz˙a˛co) exceeded
consideration for the bankrupt, or there was no consideration for the bankrupt. It is not entirely clear under the
Polish Bankruptcy Law whether the guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions since it is debatable
whether they can be qualified as disposals.

Under the Polish Restructuring Law, the Note Guarantees may also be declared ineffective or deemed
ineffective in certain situations.

The disposals made by the debtor in respect of its estate (czynnos´ci prawne, którymi dłuz˙nik
_rozporza˛dził swoim maja˛tkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for remedial proceedings will be_
deemed ineffective towards the remedial estate if the value of the disposal materially (istotnie) exceeded
consideration for the debtor or third party, or there was no consideration for the debtor. It is not entirely clear
under the Polish Restructuring Law whether the guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions since it is
debatable whether they can be qualified as disposals.

Additionally, pursuant to the Polish Restructuring Law, if: (i) the Note Guarantees were granted within
one year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings; and (ii) the Note Guarantees
were not granted directly in connection with consideration received by the Polish subsidiary guarantor, then
the Note Guarantees will be ineffective towards the remedial estate.

The Note Guarantees will be ineffective towards the remedial estate in the part in which it exceeds (as
at the date of granting the Note Guarantees) the value of the secured claim together with ancillary claims
specified in the document establishing the Note Guarantees by more than a half, and provided that the Note
Guarantees were granted within a year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings.

_Fraudulent Conveyance_

Under the Polish Civil Code of April 23, 1964 (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 1145, as amended), a
creditor (or, if the debtor is declared bankrupt, the bankruptcy receiver) may request that the relevant Polish
court declare a given legal act (such as the granting of a guarantee) ineffective towards such creditor, and the
court will do so if it finds that granting a guarantee constituted a transaction effected by a debtor to the
detriment of its creditors (i.e., where the debtor became insolvent or became insolvent to a greater extent as a
result of the transaction) while a third party has gained a benefit, and provided that (i) the debtor consciously
acted to the creditors’ detriment and (ii) the third party knew or, had it acted with due diligence, could have
known that the debtor was acting to the detriment of its other creditors (and the third party’s knowledge that
the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment is presumed if the entrepreneur who received the
benefit as a result of the transaction with the debtor remained in a permanent economic relationship with such
debtor) or gave no consideration for the benefit obtained in such transaction.

In addition, if a Polish subsidiary guarantor’s entering into a given agreement made it wholly or
partially impossible to satisfy a third party’s claim, such third party may request that the court declare such an
agreement ineffective towards that party, provided the Polish subsidiary guarantor and the other party to the
agreement knew of the third party’s claim or if the agreement was for no consideration.

The creditor with respect to whom the company’s legal transaction was declared ineffective may, with
priority over the creditors of the third party, enforce the rights over assets which as a result of such legal
transaction, were removed from the company’s estate or did not become a part of the estate.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law
applied. Generally, however, the Polish subsidiary guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay
its debts as they became due. If a court decided that the Note Guarantees provided by the Polish subsidiary

###### 436


-----

guarantor was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Note Guarantees or held it unenforceable for any
other reason, a holder of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of the Polish subsidiary guarantor
and would be a creditor solely of the Issuers and remaining Guarantors.

_Application of Foreign Law_

If any obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the Republic of Poland, it might not be
enforceable in the Republic of Poland, inter alia, to the extent that such performance would be illegal or
contrary to public policy under the laws of the other jurisdiction and a Polish court may take into account the
law of the place of performance when evaluating the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the
event of defective performance.

No law of any other jurisdiction will apply in the Republic of Poland if its application would have an
effect that is contrary to the basic principles of public order in the Republic of Poland (principles of social
co-existence).

_Other Issues Concerning the Limitations and Effectiveness of the Note Guarantees_

The Note Guarantees by the Polish subsidiary guarantor is subject to certain provisions of the Polish
Commercial Companies Code.

In accordance with Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, shareholders of a
limited liability company (spółka z ograniczona˛ odpowiedzialnos´cia˛) may not receive, on whatever account,
payments out of company’s assets which are necessary for the share capital to be fully paid up. A more general
Article 189 § 1 prohibits the return of contributions to share capital to such shareholders. In relation to a Polish
joint stock company (spółka akcyjna) Article 344 § 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code stipulates that
no payments for shares may be reimbursed to a shareholder, either fully or partially, except as allowed by the
law for the duration of the company’s existence. In the Polish legal doctrine opinions are expressed that in
certain situations, for example when the financial standing of a company entering into a transaction is poor and
the shareholder of such a company benefits from a transaction, it may constitute in fact the return of share
capital contribution to the shareholder. A breach of these rules results in the shareholders’ obligation to return
the payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, there is a risk that the Note Guarantees of the
Polish subsidiary guarantor in such form will be affected, or could be set aside, to the extent it would result in a
reduction of its assets necessary to cover in full its share capital in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish
Commercial Companies Code, a return of contribution to share capital prohibited by Article 189 § 1 of the
Polish Commercial Companies Code, or a payment prohibited by Article 344 § 1 of the Polish Commercial
Companies Code.

Additionally, in respect of the joint stock companies, Article 345 of the Polish Commercial Companies
Code stipulates certain conditions for granting financial assistance by a joint stock company for the acquisition
of its shares. If these strict conditions are not met, then the financial assistance is unlawful and all the payments
are invalid. Moreover, financial assistance is understood broadly as providing by a company, directly or
indirectly, any financing for the purposes of the acquisition of shares issued by that company, inter alia by
granting of credit, loan, guarantee or security. Therefore, the Note Guarantees will state that it does not apply
to any liability of the Polish subsidiary guarantor in the form of a joint stock company to the extent that it would
result in the Note Guarantees constituting unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 345 of the
Polish Commercial Companies Code.

_Maximum Interest Rate_

Please note that pursuant to Polish law the enforcement of interests to be paid by the Polish subsidiary
guarantor may be limited by the Polish laws setting out maximum interest rate.

The maximum interest rate is: (i) in the case of regular interest, two times the statutory interest rate (i.e.
the reference rate announced by the National Bank of Poland plus 3.5 percentage points); and (ii) in the case of
default interest, two times the default statutory interest rate (i.e. the reference rate announced by National Bank
of Poland plus 5.5 percentage points). As of the date hereof the maximum interest rate resulting from a legal
transaction is equal to 7.2% p.a. and the maximum default interest rate (odsetki maksymalne za opóz´nienie) is
equal to 11.2% p.a.

Regulation on the maximum interest rates applies irrespectively of the law governing the agreement.
Consequence of breach of the provisions on maximum interest rates is an automatic application of the
maximum interests stipulated in law as opposed to the agreed higher rate.

The Netherlands

_Insolvency_

Three of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. In the event of insolvency
of a Dutch company or a provider of security interests having its center of main interests in the Netherlands
(each a “Dutch Provider”), any insolvency proceedings relating to the Dutch Provider would likely be based on
Dutch insolvency law, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings, as amended from time to
time. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in the Netherlands in
accordance with Dutch law against companies that are not established under Dutch law provided that such
company has an establishment in the Netherlands.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, suspension of payments
(surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor
to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the
assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments
often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it
will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they come due. Once the application for a suspension of
payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint
one or more administrators (bewindvoerders) and often also a supervisor judge (rechter-commissaris). A
meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition
(ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, a court can order
that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the
composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by a court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of
payments ends as soon as a court’s decision becomes final. The definitive suspension of payment will generally
be granted by the court, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by
creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the
amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential creditors declare against it or if there is
a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no
prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to
satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to
some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition).
Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a
of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors.
During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject
to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments
or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of
the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also
request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het
_Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest_
(openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to their respective priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the
extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties,
such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and
mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the general
costs of the bankruptcy; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a
statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed
by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, which has the same effects as set forth
above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a bankruptcy trustee (curator) can force a secured
party to enforce its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the bankruptcy trustee
pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the bankruptcy trustee will be entitled to
sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of general
costs of the bankruptcy; (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s bankruptcy
trustee and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor; and (iv) the
bankruptcy trustee may force the secured creditor to hand the proceeds of certain pledged assets

###### 438


-----

(bodemzaken) over to the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the Dutch tax authorities pursuant to Article 57
(3) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act.

In general, under Dutch law, rights of mortgage and pledge rank above other rights of priority,
including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, this is
subject to exceptions, such as set forth under (iv) above. Under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’
priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on machinery and inventory (not including stock
(voorraden)) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). In addition, a pledgee is obligated to
notify the Dutch tax authorities of (i) its intention to exercise its rights under a pledge on movable property (not
including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken) within the meaning of the Tax
Collection Act (Invorderingswet 1990), or (ii) its intention to perform, to procure in any way the performance of,
or cooperate with any legal of factual act with respect to such property which could prejudice the Dutch tax
authorities’ priority right to such property. Following such notification, a statutory waiting period of up to four
weeks starting from the date of notification has to be observed. In the four weeks following such notification,
the pledgee may not exercise its security rights in respect of such assets or perform any action with respect to
such assets which could prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right. During this waiting period, the Dutch
tax authorities may exercise their priority right in respect of specific property for certain tax debts
(bodemvoorrecht). Failure to notify the Dutch tax authorities, or the exercise of its security rights within the
aforementioned waiting period in the manner contemplated in subclause (i) or (ii) above, may result in the
pledgee having to pay to the Dutch tax authorities an amount equal to the value of the relevant assets or—in the
case of an enforcement—the proceeds derived from the enforcement, provided that the amount payable shall
not exceed the amount of the relevant taxes due, regardless of whether such taxes have already assessed or
not. After the four-week waiting period has lapsed, or upon an earlier notification by the Dutch tax authorities
that they will not exercise their priority right, a pledgee may exercise its security rights. However, the pledgee
may only exercise such security rights during the four weeks following the lapse of the waiting period, or the
date of the notification from the Dutch tax authorities, as the case may be. After the four-week period has
ended, the aforementioned limitations are applicable again and the pledgee will only be able to exercise its
security rights with respect to such property, after a new notification to the Dutch tax authorities and
observance of a new waiting period.

Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch bankruptcy trustee (curator) and a
supervisory judge are appointed. The bankruptcy trustee is charged with the administration and liquidation of
the bankruptcy estate and acts under the supervision of the supervisory judge.

Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce the potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy
proceedings. Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from midnight of the day
on which the suspension of payments or the bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared.

A suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured
creditors and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) to satisfy their claims by
proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of
payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above may be ordered by the competent court
both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference
by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to enforce on assets of the
bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets. Restrictions on the
enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher-ranking rights must be respected. These may
include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights
and other rights, as described above, may be imposed. Furthermore, a bankruptcy trustee can force a secured
creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing which the bankruptcy trustee will
be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of
the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be
significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set
off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy,
although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in
obtaining the claim used for the set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by the operation of law
when a suspension of payments is granted and terminate by the operation of law when bankruptcy is declared.
In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments
having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as
the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending
on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A
composition will generally be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a

###### 439


-----

simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting of the
recognized and of the admitted creditors representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the
(conditionally) admitted claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by a court. Under certain
conditions, a court or judge commissioner (rechter-commissaris) (as the case may be) may derogate from this
procedure. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the
Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of
payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a suspension of
payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the
proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their
claims. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal
treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain preferred creditors
(such as the tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other
creditors. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that are due and payable by their terms within
one year of the date of the bankruptcy of the relevant guarantor or security grantor will be accelerated and
become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy to
be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the bankruptcy trustee determines the value of the claim
and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings to the purpose of the
distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that would not have been payable within one year from
the date of the bankruptcy may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after
the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the
noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting
(verificatie vergadering), the bankruptcy trustee, the insolvent debtor and all provisionally verified creditors
may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed
in the creditors meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). Such renvooi
procedures could also cause payments to the Holders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed
claims. As a suspension of payments proceedings, in a bankruptcy a composition may be offered to creditors,
which shall in general be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple
majority of the meeting of unsecured non-preferential creditors, with admitted and provisionally admitted
claims representing at least 50% of the total amount of the admitted and provisionally admitted unsecured non
preferential claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under certain conditions, the
supervisory judge (rechter- commissaris) may derogate from this procedure. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does
not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the
secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who
will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch
insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors which have a right in rem (goederenrechtelijke rechten) may enforce their rights
against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in
suspension of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of four
months during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained
leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. The bankruptcy trustee may force a secured creditor to
realize its security right by giving the creditor notice to do so within a reasonable time. A failure to take
recourse by the creditor will result in the creditor forfeiting its rights to enforce its security rights, albeit that its
claim shall continue to be preferred. However, in such an event the creditor must contribute to costs of the
bankruptcy which may be considerable. Any excess proceeds of enforcement and for which there is no valid
security right must be returned to the bankruptcy estate and may not be off set to any unsecured claims against
the debtor.

Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without
limitation, the provision of security or an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency
proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its bankruptcy trustee, if (i) it performed
such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of its
bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was
performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration (om niet)) the party with or towards which it
acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In
addition, in the case of such a bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may nullify the debtor’s performance of any
due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a
third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been
filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation
between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.

###### 440


-----

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments
against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets, will be terminated by operation of law.
Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch bankruptcy trustee will be appointed. The
proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankrupt estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured
creditors under the guarantees granted by a bankrupt guarantor after the secured and the preferential
creditors have been satisfied. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.
Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated different from creditors that are incorporated or residing in the
Netherlands.

On 6 October 2020 the Dutch legislator has adopted a bill for the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord), with the aim to implement an
out-of-court restructuring instrument enabling companies in financial distress to restructure their debts without
the need to initiate formal insolvency procedures (such as bankruptcy or suspension of payment). The bill has
entered into force on 1 January 2021.

The goal of the new legislation is to introduce a preventive restructuring procedure enabling debtors
in financial difficulties to restructure at an early stage and avoid insolvency. A restructuring plan under the new
legislation can be proposed by a debtor who foresees that it will not be able to continue paying its due and
payable debts (the debts as they fall due). Under such circumstances, the debtor or a court appointed
restructuring specialist may offer a restructuring plan to the debtor’s creditors and shareholders. A
restructuring plan could propose an amendment or discharge of the rights and claims of all creditors and
shareholders involved. Once approved and confirmed by the relevant percentage of creditors and the court,
the restructuring plan will be binding on all creditors and shareholders involved in the restructuring plan.
Subject to certain safeguards, creditors and shareholders who have voted against the restructuring plan could
be (cross-) crammed down and thus also be bound by the restructuring plan. Taking into account the
provisions in the act, claims against the relevant Guarantor can, inter alia, be (partially) discharged or extended
as a result of a restructuring plan if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in
favour of such a plan and the court subsequently approves the plan to avoid the relevant Guarantor’s
insolvency.

Under the Temporary Act COVID 19 Ministry of Social Affairs and Ministry of Justice (Tijdelijke wet
_COVID-19 SZW en JV) a debtor is (amongst others) entitled to request the court for suspension of enforcement_
measures and/or any court decisions concerning bankruptcy petitions. The court may grant such request of the
debtor under certain specific circumstances, such as either (i) a suspension is necessary for continuation of the
company’s activities, or (ii) it is summarily evidenced that the current financial situation is mainly (or entirely)
caused by the measures imposed as from 16 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as a result of
which the company is temporarily unable to pay its debts, and it is evidenced that the financial situation of the
company before the COVID-19 outbreak was normal and is expected to improve in the (near) future. If
approved, such suspension would be initially granted for two months and could be extended by up to two
additional suspension periods of two months each.

The temporary act entered into force on 17 December 2020 and was originally scheduled to expire on
1 February 2021. The expiration date has since then been extended by Royal Decree to 1 April 2021 and can
be further extended indefinitely for periods of two months each.

_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests_

If a Dutch company grants a guarantee or a security interest and that guarantee or security interest is
not in the Company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the Dutch
company, its bankruptcy trustee and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in conjunction with the board of the
Dutch company and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining
whether the granting of such guarantee or security interest is in the interest of the relevant company, the Dutch
Courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but
all relevant circumstances including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the
transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted. In addition, if it is determined
that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the
guarantee or security interest, then such company (and its bankruptcy trustee) may contest the enforcement of
the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may,
according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the
interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant
whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company
would foreseeable be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible
that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void
if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant
company’s objects.

Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a security document may be withheld under the
doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet toerekenbare
_tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden) and other defenses afforded by_
Netherlands law to obligors generally. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security
interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van
_omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling); furthermore, under Netherlands law,_
a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance of its obligations under such
agreement pursuant to the exception non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise. Other impeding factors include
rights of suspension (opschorting), a dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). The
enforceability of the obligations of a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act
(Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the
enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation,
enforcement and collection costs.

Under Dutch rules on financial assistance, a company may not grant guarantees or collateral with a
view to the acquisition of its shares by a third party. This prohibition also applies to any subsidiaries of the
relevant company (including foreign subsidiaries). It is generally assumed that a guarantee or collateral which
violates Dutch financial assistance rules prohibitions is null and void. More specifically, if a guarantee or
collateral partly violates financial assistance prohibitions, the guarantee or collateral will be void for that part. In
addition, there is a risk that the void part will contaminate the remainder of the guarantee or collateral so that,
from a Dutch law perspective, the guarantee or collateral is void in its entirety. In order to enable Dutch
subsidiaries to grant guarantees or other collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company without the risk of violating Dutch rules on financial assistance, it is standard market practice for
indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so called “limitation language” in
relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in the Netherlands. Pursuant to such limitation language, it
is agreed between the relevant parties that such guarantee or collateral is deemed not to be given to the
extent the same would constitute a violation of the Dutch rules on financial assistance. Such limitation language
will also be included in the guarantee and security documents granted by any Dutch Provider. Legislation
which abolishes the financial assistance prohibition came into force on October 1, 2012. There is no transitional
law included in the new legislation and therefore the financial assistance prohibition for private companies with
limited liability (besloten vennootschappen met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) has ceased to exist as per
October 1, 2012. To the extent any agreement, articles of association, security documents or any other
document refer to “Section 2:207c Dutch Civil Code” only or do not contain any reference to financial
assistance, the prohibition has ceased as per October 1, 2012. However, to the extent any agreement, articles
of association, security documents or any other document has reflected in it the literal text of Section 2:207c
Dutch Civil Code or similar provision, such provision will continue to apply as a contractual matter between
parties regardless the abolishment of the financial assistance itself.

Pursuant to Dutch law it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other
than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the security
documents pursuant to which a security interest will be granted in the assets of the Dutch subsidiaries use a
parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch subsidiaries, as separate and independent obligations, undertake to
pay to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts
due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent
claim of the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a
security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders
of the Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt,
and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt
provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered
hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are
reduced (and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a Dutch court
and we cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by the any Dutch Guarantor under a guarantee or
security interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch
law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such guarantee or security interest. The
validity and enforceability of a guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in, any Dutch Guarantors may
also be successfully contested by the any Dutch Guarantors (or their bankruptcy trustee) on the basis of an ultra
vires claim. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of our Dutch subsidiaries under a guarantee or
security interest may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the subsidiaries’ respective
bankruptcy trustee when the subsidiary is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the
interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Netherlands Civil
Code and Netherlands Bankruptcy Act are met. As a result, the value of the guarantee and security interests
provided by the Dutch Guarantors may be limited.

###### 442


-----

Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into
by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its bankruptcy trustee (curator) if the objects of that
entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known
this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Netherlands
Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal
entity are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association
(statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the
transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether
the subsistence of the company is jeopardized by the transaction.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant security
document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a
fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.
However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the
maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or
security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Guarantee, or the granting of the security,
was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that
the payment obligations under such Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security
over the collateral, or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
Notes or such Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event
of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect
of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor
or security provider, if applicable, under any Note Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been
declared void.

France

_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens
on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the
Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it
should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or
action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a
stock company (socie´ te´ par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities
account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The
securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (de´ claration de
_nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each_
statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and
shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French company whose shares are pledged. In
France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges
over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is
not publicly registered.

_Limitation on Enforcement of Security Interests_

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be
enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that is
due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the
secured creditors either (i) before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the
proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged_
assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged
assets.

If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or
contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed
assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) or by an expert (pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge) in the context of a contractual_
foreclosure (pacte commissoire).

###### 443


-----

In case of enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure),
if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be
required to pay the relevant pledgor a cash amount (“soulte”) equal to the difference between the value of the
pledged assets as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual
amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. On
the contrary, if the value of such pledged assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant
amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets,
and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could also be undertaken through a public auction in
accordance with applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business
as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the
value of our group as a going concern.

_Security Agent_

A security agent may be appointed as « agent des suˆ rete´ s » pursuant to articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of
the French Civil Code which will be acting in its own name (en son nom propre) for the benefit of the secured
creditors (au profit des cre´ anciers de l’obligation garantie) in relation to the security interests and personal
guarantees created. The security agent will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As a result, the
rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security
agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of
pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful
misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured
creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency
proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its
duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and
the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third
parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the
French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des suˆ rete´ s) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, (which
will be the case here for the Security Documents governed by French law). The holders of interests in the Notes
from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to
benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel
debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and
the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Senior
Secured Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall
discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of
a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly
secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through
the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the
Collateral). Although the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held (in a decision dated September
13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-25.533 Belve´ de` re) rendered in the context of safeguard
proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt”
governed by the laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of
international public policy (ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt
obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French
courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the
Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

###### 444


-----

_Trustee_

Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Trustee as trustee for the holders
of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes
Indenture, and may therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been
recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code (although the scope of and definitions
in Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code are tax-specific and do not reconcile entirely with the common law
vision of trusts) and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belve´ de` re decision referred
to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the
laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in
France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the La Haye
Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of
“trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the
Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in
the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Trustee.

_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French courts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or
lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (socie´ te´ par actions) governed by French law is a pledge
over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such
company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered,
such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a
company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities
account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower
ranking pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore
provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as
“tiers convenus” (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have
consented to the creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have
accepted their appointment as tiers convenus and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of
both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. To our knowledge, French courts have
never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities
account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognise the possibility to create multiple pledges
in respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial
securities account, and consequently, no assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges
would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities
account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by
a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as
applicable) following an enforcement event.

_Fraudulent Conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
insolvency proceedings, the “action paulienne” provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation,
an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or
agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be
challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire a` l’exe´ cution du plan)
insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside
insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the
act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the
person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the
person’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of
the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction
knew or should have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (a` titre gratuit), in

###### 445


-----

which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of
fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the
Collateral, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense
under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or
the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared
unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such
successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes or the security interests in
the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes,
the security interests in the Collateral could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and,
possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be
held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuers or the Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

_Assumptions as to the Validity of the Intercreditor Agreement_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French supreme court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor
Agreement, except for article L.626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of
safeguard proceedings, the safeguard plan which is put to the committees of creditors takes into consideration
(prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into
prior to the opening of the safeguard proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above
(which, as at the date of this offering memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out
that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Luxembourg

_Insolvency_

The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to holders of Senior Notes as insolvency
laws of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. If the LuxCo is incorporated and has its centre of
main interests (centre des intérêts principaux), for the purposes of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, and its
registered office and central administration (administration centrale) in Luxembourg, insolvency proceedings
affecting the LuxCo would be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of
the key features of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg.
_Luxembourg insolvency proceedings_

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of insolvency proceedings (together referred
to as “Insolvency Proceedings”) may be opened against the LuxCo to the extent that the LuxCo has its central
administration (administration centrale) or its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux) (for the
purposes of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) in Luxembourg:

    - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite);

    - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée); and

    - preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite).

In addition to these Insolvency Proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Senior Notes to recover
payment on the Senior Notes may be affected by a decision of the Commercial District Court (Tribunal
_d’arrondissement siégeant en matière commerciale) granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or_
putting the LuxCo into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire).

_Bankruptcy proceedings (faillite)_

_General administration of bankruptcy proceedings_

The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested r by any of its creditors. Following such a
request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that
the LuxCo (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its commercial
creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are
met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the LuxCo or a
creditor. Moreover, the management body of the LuxCo must declare bankruptcy if it comes to the conclusion
that the two aforementioned conditions are met.

###### 446


-----

If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy
receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge_commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings._

The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in
the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken
into account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds.

The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the LuxCo in place of the
managers. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the LuxCo’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the LuxCo’s
creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt
company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents the LuxCo as well as the creditors collectively
(masse des créanciers).

The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain
acts, such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the LuxCo during the
bankruptcy proceedings.

Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit
restructuring options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs.

On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved.

_Effects of bankruptcy proceedings_

The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against
the LuxCo, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of unsecured
creditors of the LuxCo in accordance with their rank upon the realization of the assets of the LuxCo.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement
of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial
(intuitu personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by
law, such as employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions
purporting to terminate a contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid.

Unsecured claims of the LuxCo will, in the event of a bankrupcty of the LuxCo, only rank after (i) the
cost of bankrupcty (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such bankrupcty) and (ii) the debts of the
LuxCo that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include,
_inter alia:_

    - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

    - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

    - social security contributions; and

    - remuneration owed to employees.

    - For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution
to unsecured creditors of the LuxCo (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realised and
subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During
insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the LuxCo are suspended.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the
LuxCo during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the Luxembourg court
and dates back not more than six months as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates
a company bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days
before the commencement of such period. In particular:

pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions (in particular, the
granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within
the meaning of the Luxembourg act of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the

###### 447


-----

Collateral Act 2005), the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by
way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any
means other than in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from
inception), transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into
during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside, if so requested by the bankruptcy
receiver;
pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as
well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to setting aside by
the Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded
with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and

pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil
code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge
any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made
prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

_Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée)_

_General administration of controlled management proceedings_

The LuxCo, which has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) or which is not in a
position to completely fulfil its obligations, can apply for the regime of controlled management in order either
(i) to restructure its business or (ii) to realize its assets in good conditions. An application for controlled
management can only be made by the LuxCo.

The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied
in bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criterium (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to
completely fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the LuxCo is taken. Controlled
management proceedings are only available for a good-faith debtor.

Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally
lead to bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance
companies, which are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a
default of group companies.

The proceedings are divided into three steps:

The LuxCo must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court
can reject the application because (i) the LuxCo has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence
brought forward by the LuxCo does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the LuxCo’s
business or improve the realization of the LuxCo’s assets in better conditions. If the application is upheld at this
stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the
overall situation of the LuxCo.

Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down
the application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the
reorganization of the business or the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or more
administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of the LuxCo If the Commercial
District Court ascertains that the LuxCo is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the LuxCo has ceased its payments
(cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which the LuxCo will be deemed to have been in such
situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of application for controlled management
proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for bankruptcy are met
(cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de
_crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after consideration of the report by the_
investigating judge or after the reorganization plan proposed by the administrators (commissaires) at the third
step described below. The administrators will draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial
situation of the LuxCo. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of the LuxCo. The administrators may
also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or its creditors. The administrators
have to be convened to any meeting of the board of managers. They may attend all board meetings but have
no voting rights. They have the right to convene such board meetings.

The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for
realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall
equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages (hypothèques)
and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual clause regarding

###### 448


-----

termination, penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the creditors, joint debtors
and guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial
District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be considered as
having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the guarantors may submit
written observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan
if a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the
administrators, at least half of the LuxCo’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed
by the administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been
challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which
case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an
amended plan (such amended plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving
the plan will be binding upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the
administrators will be fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The
administrators who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees.

_Effects of a controlled management proceedings_

As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on the
application for controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts, even if initiated by
privileged creditors (including creditors who have the benefit of pledges (gages) and mortgages
(hypothèques)) are stayed, save as provided for by the Collateral Act 2005. The LuxCo may not enter into any
act of disposition, mortgage and contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the
investigating judge.

Once the administrators have been appointed, the LuxCo may not carry out any act (including
receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization
of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to
have any act made in violation of the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the
creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may
bring an action (i) to have the managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District
Court has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments, compensations or
security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445 et seq. of the Luxembourg code
of commerce).

_Preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite)_

_General administration of preventive composition proceedings_

The LuxCo may enter into a preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) in
order to resolve its financial difficulties by entering into an agreement with its creditors, the purpose of which is
to avoid bankruptcy.

Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial
difficulty. Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition proceedings are not
available if the company has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the
company is acting in bad faith. The application for the preventive composition proceedings can only be made
by the LuxCo and must be supported by proposals of preventive composition.

The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify,
and to prepare a report on, the situation of the LuxCo. Based on such report, the Commercial District Court will
decide whether or not to pursue the preventive composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court
considers that the procedure should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the
company (which bankruptcy may also be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the
conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the
procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which
the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its report at the assemblée concordataire.

The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their
unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the LuxCo’s debt, has adhered to the proposal and if the preventive
composition has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages
(hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the
concordat, if they renounce the benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the
concordat entails renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but
representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights.

###### 449


-----

The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a
pledge and on claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition arrangement
sanctioned by the Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still either be annulled (if it has
not been executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the
Commercial District Court may adjudicate bankrupt the LuxCo. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the
date of cessation of payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that
date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of
payment date at six months prior to its judgment.

Preventive composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon
secured creditors.

_Effects of a preventive composition proceedings_

The LuxCo’s business activities continue during the preventive composition proceedings. While the
preventive composition is being negotiated, the LuxCo may not dispose of, or grant any security over, any
assets without the approval of the delegated judge. Once the preventive composition has been agreed by the
Commercial District Court, this restriction is lifted. However, the LuxCo’s business activities will still be
supervised by the delegated judge.

While the preventive composition is being negotiated, unsecured creditors may not take action
against the company to recover their claims. Secured creditors who do not participate in the preventive
composition proceedings may take action against the LuxCo to recover their claims and to enforce their
security. Fraudulent transactions which took place before the date on which the Commercial District Court
commenced preventive composition proceedings may be set aside (please see the bankruptcy proceedings
section above).

_Suspension of payments proceedings (sursis de paiements)_

_General administration of a suspension of payments proceedings_

A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the sursis
_de paiement proceedings available to banks and insurance companies. It can only be applied to a company_
which, as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which
has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of
payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious
elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts.

The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking
experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding
involving both the Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority
of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured
by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)).

The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons
it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to
obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured
claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned.

_Effects of suspension of payments proceedings_

During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against
the LuxCo or the LuxCo ‘s assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to
creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements
governed by the Collateral Act 2005. The LuxCo continues to manage its own business under the supervision
of a court-appointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the LuxCo.

When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the LuxCo’s
managers can run the business again.

_Judicial liquidation_

Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against
companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the Luxembourg
commercial code or of the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the
Companies Law 1915).

###### 450


-----

The management of such judicial liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those
applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.

_Exceptional measures taken by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in response to the COVID-19 virus pandemic_

It should be noted that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has exceptionally taken, in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, certain measures including a suspension of certain procedural deadlines applicable in
civil and commercial matters. This suspension of delays applies to the one month procedural time-limit for the
insolvency filing obligation provided by article 440 of the Luxembourg commercial code. In principle, such a
suspension of delays should (i) not prevent directors / managers of a Luxembourg company from filing for
bankruptcy (if the conditions thereof are met) and (ii) not restrict the rights of creditors to petition for
bankruptcy of a Luxembourg company. Based on the current legislation, suspension of delays to file for
bankruptcy within one month should remain in place until 30 June 2021.

_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests_

_Granting of security interests_

When a Luxembourg company grants security interests, the granting of the envisaged security
interests must notably comply with the company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must
be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation of the French “intérêt social,” a somewhat
equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not
defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being
reasonable or “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.”

The concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment and is of particular importance in the
context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915. The failure to
comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (civil and/or criminal) for the
directors or managers of the security provider concerned. The security interests granted by a Luxembourg
company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public
policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the
Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of
corporate assets if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an
interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition,
it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse
of corporate assets became known to him / her. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by
court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of
Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void.

The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based
judgment is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company.

_Creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests_

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex
rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a
pledge) are situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such
assets.

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement
of pledges over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as shares in Luxembourg
companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law
and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are
held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over
financial collateral located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends
on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a
Luxembourg company must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares
(subject to the pledge) and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are
pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such
company. A pledge under a receivables pledge agreement will be validly created and perfected provided that
the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is executed by the parties thereto. However, if the
debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the

###### 451


-----

pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement
must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any
pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are
pledged, additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of
the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event,
including, but not limited to:

    - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value
determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

    - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (in case of listed
shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction;

    - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

    - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need
to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges
might be substantially delayed.

The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third
party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security
interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such
creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the
beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject
to preferred rights by operation of law).

The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent
that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions
depending on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Collateral Act 2005,
a financial collateral may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral takers, a fiduciary or a
trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these
third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis
third-party beneficiaries of such financial collateral, persons acting on behalf of the third-party beneficiaries of a
financial collateral, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries
of a financial collateral under the Collateral Act 2005.

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges
and transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if
entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and
any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or
foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganisation affecting any one of the parties.

_Recognition of foreign law governed security interests_

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be
enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. The powers of
any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets
located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider becomes
subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction
because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets.

Article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 applies to (i) Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements
and (ii) any “similar” foreign law collateral arrangement, to the extent that it covers assets (avoirs) within the
meaning of the Collateral Act 2005, i.e. (i) financial instruments and (ii) claims (together, the Collateral Act 2005
Assets), to the exclusion of any other rights or assets.

To determine if a foreign law governed collateral arrangement could be considered (for the purposes
of article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005) as a “similar” collateral arrangement (i.e. similar to a Luxembourg law
governed collateral arrangement governed by the Collateral Act 2005), a Luxembourg court (if having

###### 452


-----

jurisdiction) might, presumably, analyze elements, such as, the main features and effects of such foreign law
governed collateral arrangement taking into account, notably, the scope and type of security (e.g., fixed
charge, floating charge), the nature of the security assets (i.e. whether or not they consist in Collateral Act 2005
Assets), the type of rights created in favor of a creditor (e.g., personal guarantee or right in rem) and whether a
similar type of security interest may exist under Luxembourg law. Should a Luxembourg judge come to the
conclusion that a foreign law governed collateral constitutes a “similar” collateral arrangement (within the
meaning of article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005), such foreign law governed collateral arrangement would
benefit from the above-mentioned protection under article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 insofar Collateral Act
2005 Assets are concerned.

In a European cross-border insolvency context, paragraph 1 of article 8 of the European Insolvency
Regulation, pursuant to which the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of
creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets – both specific
assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time – belonging to the debtor
which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of insolvency
proceedings, should be binding upon Luxembourg insolvency courts.

Subject to certain exceptions (provided for in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation), in the scenario
where (i) main insolvency proceedings (within the meaning of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) would be
opened against the LuxCo in Luxembourg and (ii) the assets over which security is granted under and pursuant
to the foreign security agreements would be located or deemed to be located within the territory of a Member
State (as defined in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) other than Luxembourg, the opening of such main
proceedings against the LuxCo in Luxembourg should not affect the rights in rem of the creditors in respect of
assets of the LuxCo over which security is granted under and pursuant to the foreign security agreements, in
accordance with the above-mentioned paragraph 1 of article 8 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.

###### CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the
Notes (or any interest therein) by (i) “employee benefit plans” that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) “plans” (including individual retirement
accounts) as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(“Code”), (iii) entities whose underlying assets include the assets of any such employee benefit plan subject to
ERISA or other plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and (iv) governmental plans (as defined in
Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as
described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) that, while not subject to Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to other federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) (each
of (i)-(iv), a “Plan”). This summary is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the
Notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their own counsel to
determine whether such acquisition will violate Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code
or any Similar Law.

General Fiduciary Considerations

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,
direct or indirect, to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan
including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law.

Prohibited Transaction Considerations

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a
statutory or administrative exemption or exception is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or
disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and
other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by an ERISA Plan with respect to which
the applicable Issuer or any of their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified
person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable
statutory or administrative exemption or exception. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”)
has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of
the Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective
investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional
asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by an insurance company general account), PTCE 96-23
(relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by
insurance company pooled separate accounts). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary
service providers to the ERISA Plan; provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates
(directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice
with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan
pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that
any of the PTCEs or any other exemption or exception will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or exception is available, it
will cover all aspects of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult with their advisors
regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions.

###### 454


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired, held or disposed
of by any Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and disposition
would not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law.

Plan Asset Considerations

Regulations promulgated under ERISA by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA (together, the “Plan Asset Regulations”), provide that when an ERISA Plan acquires an
“equity interest” in an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act, the ERISA Plan’s assets include both the equity
interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is established either
that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or that the entity is an
“operating company”, in each case as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations. For purposes of the Plan Asset
Regulations, equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors will not be significant if benefit plan
investors hold, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interests of such entity,
excluding equity interests held by any person (other than a “benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary
authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or
indirect) with respect to such assets, and any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations) of such
person. For purposes of this 25% test, “benefit plan investors” include ERISA Plans and any entity whose
underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code to include, “plan
assets” by reason of an ERISA Plan’s investment in the entity under the Plan Asset Regulations, but exclude
governmental, church and non-U.S. plans.

While the discussion under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain United States Federal Income Tax
_Considerations” assumes the Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such_
characterisation is not entirely clear, and no assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a
court would not uphold, a different characterisation of the Notes. In addition, it is anticipated that (i) the Notes
will not constitute “publicly offered securities” for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations and (ii) none of the
Issuers will be an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.

If the applicable Issuer’s assets were deemed to be “plan assets” of an ERISA Plan holding the Notes,
this would result in, among other things, (i) the application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility
standards of ERISA to investments made by the applicable Issuer, and (ii) the possibility that certain
transactions that the applicable Issuer might enter into, or may have entered into, in the ordinary course of
business might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited transactions under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes (and interests therein) may not be purchased by, transferred to or
otherwise held by any Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan, except in the event that such Plan or
person has obtained the written approval of the applicable Issuer to subscribe for and purchase the Notes in
the offering directly from the Initial Purchasers. In no case, however, shall benefit plan investors be authoriszed
by the applicable Issuer to subscribe for and purchase, in the aggregate, 25% or more of the total value of any
class of equity interests of the applicable Issuer. Any Plan that acquires the Notes (or interests therein) in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and any successor to any such Plan, shall be referred to
herein as an “Approved Plan”. In the event that a Plan or any person acting on any Plan’s behalf purchases,
acquires or holds the Notes (or any interest therein) without meeting these requirements, the purported
purchase, transfer or holding will be void and, if such purchase or transfer is not treated as being void for any
reason, the Notes will automatically be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary
and the purported holder will acquire no right in the Notes.

Representations

Accordingly, each purchaser and transferee is deemed to represent, warrant and covenant (and will
be required to represent, warrant and covenant in writing, in the case of an Approved Plan), for so long as it
holds such Note (or any interest therein), that (a) either (1) it is not a Plan and is not acting on behalf of any Plan
or (2)(i) it is an Approved Plan and (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Note (or any interest
therein) will not (A) constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or (B) constitute or result in a violation of any Similar Law, and (b) it will not transfer
the Note (or interest therein) to any transferee that is a Plan or any person acting on behalf of any Plan.

Each purchaser and transferee that is an Approved Plan will be required to further represent, warrant
and covenant in writing that (i) none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or any
other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum, or other persons that provide
marketing services, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided any investment recommendation or

investment advice on which the Approved Plan, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the
Approved Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the
Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or
Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Approved Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the Approved
Plan’s acquisition of the Notes; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in
evaluating the investment in the Notes.

Any purported purchase, transfer, holding or disposition in violation of these representations will be
void. If such purchase, transfer, holding or disposition is not treated as being void for any reason, the Notes will
automatically be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the purported
holder will acquire no right in the Notes.

###### NOTICE TO INVESTORS

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of
any of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of
any other jurisdictions, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A and to
non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes under the Securities Act and, therefore, the
Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. Accordingly, the Issuers are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer
and resale only:

    - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs” as defined
in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

    - to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Issuers and the Initial Purchaser as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been
registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes
are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act
or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto
and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and
(5) below.

(2) You are not our “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) or acting on our
behalf and you are either:

(a) a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act and are aware that
any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of
another QIB; or

(b) you are a non-U.S. person and are purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

(3) You acknowledge that none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any
person representing any of them, has made any representation to you with respect to us or
the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this offering
memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you
are relying in making your investment decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge
that the Issuers, and not the Initial Purchasers, have ultimate authority over the statements
contained in this offering memorandum, including the content of those statements and
whether and how to communicate them. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers
nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum. You have had access to such
financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as you have deemed necessary
in connection with your decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to
ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

###### 457


-----

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all
times within its or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes
pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under
the Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are
purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will
be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the
“Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year (in the case of 144A Global Notes) after
the latest of the closing date, the closing date of the issuance of any additional Notes and the
last date on which the applicable Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of the Notes or
any predecessor of the Notes or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S Global Notes) after the
later of the closing date and the date on which the Notes are first offered to persons other
than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S, only
(i) to the applicable Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so
long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act to a person you
reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to
whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the
United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any
other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in
each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or
the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and
regulations, and further subject to the Issuers’ and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer,
sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clauses (iv) and (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of
the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the
reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The
foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction
Termination Date.

(6) You are deemed to represent, warrant and covenant (and will be required to represent,
warrant and covenant in writing, in the case of an Approved Plan), for so long as you hold the
Note (or any interest therein), that (a) either (1) you are not a Plan and are not acting on behalf
of any Plan or (2)(i) you are an Approved Plan and (ii) your acquisition, holding and
disposition of the Note (or any interest therein) will not (A) constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
or (B) constitute or result in a violation of any Similar Law, and (b) you will not transfer the
Note (or interest therein) to any transferee that is a Plan or any person acting on behalf of any
Plan.

(7) If you are an Approved Plan, you will be required to further represent, warrant and covenant
in writing that (i) none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or any
other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum, or other persons that
provide marketing services, or any of their respective affiliates, has provided any investment
recommendation or investment advice on which you, or any Plan Fiduciary, has relied as a
primary basis in connection with your or its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not
otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or
Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to you or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with your
acquisition of the Notes; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent
judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following
effect:

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply
to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(8) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Notes.

(9) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or
sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is
made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

(10) You acknowledge that the Trustee will not be required to accept for registration or transfer
any Notes acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the
Trustee that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account.

required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set
forth under “Plan of Distribution.”

You acknowledge that this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from
registration under the Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with SEC rules that would apply
to an offering document relating to a public offering of securities.

###### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers
have agreed to purchase from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, the Senior PIK Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the
Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior PIK Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Senior PIK Notes. Each of the sales will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, the Senior PIK Notes Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering
memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will
purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase the Senior Secured Notes from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior PIK Notes from the
Senior PIK Notes Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the
Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the
delivery of certain legal opinions of counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser
defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased to a certain
extent or the offering may be terminated.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that
appear on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers
may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms of the Notes may be varied by
the Initial Purchasers from time to time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes
through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers
reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to prospective investors and to reject orders in whole or
in part.

Certain of the CVC Funds may place a purchase order for and may be allocated Notes at a purchase
price per Note equal to the issue prices set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days
after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the
Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating
in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under
“Notice to Investors.”

Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not U.S. registered broker-dealers and, therefore, to the extent that
they intend to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, will do so through one or more U.S. registered
broker-dealers as permitted by the Regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the
Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

We have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract
or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors
of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuers will apply,
through their listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, the Issuers cannot
assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained.

###### 461


-----

The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without
notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will
be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will
be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—
_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about April 8,
2021, which will be 9 business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act)
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + 9”). Under Rule
15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade
the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the following 9 business days will be required by virtue
of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T + 9, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult
their own advisors.

No sales of similar securities

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers
certain customary fees or discounts for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for
certain out of pocket expenses. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of,
except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior PIK Notes Issuer, the Guarantors providing the Note Guarantees and or any of
their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase
Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior
written consent of Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE as representative for the Initial Purchasers.

Notice to prospective investors in the EEA

_MiFID II_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that it has not offered, sold or
otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor,” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II. The expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

_PRIIPs regulation / prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors_

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Notice to prospective investors in the United Kingdom

The offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who: (i) are outside the UK; (ii) have
professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”); (iii)
are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”)
of the Financial Promotion Order; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in

investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any
securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). The offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and
must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment
activity to which the offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in
only with relevant persons.

_UK MiFIR_

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is
only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”) and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities
(for the purposes of this provision, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term “manufacturers” shall mean such
of the Joint Bookrunners and Co-Managers as are subject to the product governance rules under COBS and
UK MiFIR.

_UK PRIIPs regulation / prohibition of sales to UK retail investors_

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

Stabilization

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess
of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling
concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a
stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the
price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the Offering,
creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and
purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose
penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market
levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may
end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—
_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on

###### 463


-----

or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these
activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the
Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the
over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Affiliation

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide
in the future investment banking, financial advisory (including, but not limited to, in connection with the
Transaction), and/or commercial banking services to us and/or our affiliates (or former affiliates) in the ordinary
course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and
reimbursement of expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are also lenders under existing
credit facilities (including the Existing Senior Secured Facilities) and are holders of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and/or Existing Senior Notes, which will be repaid as a result of the Transaction.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch is acting as agent under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and the Existing Senior Notes, and will act as Security Agent for the Notes, the Senior Secured Facilities
and the Intercreditor Agreement. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch is acting as agent under the Existing
Senior Secured Facilities and will act as the agent under the Senior Secured Facilities. The Initial Purchasers
and/or their affiliates may also enter into hedging arrangements with us in connection with the Transaction.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the
Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit
exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, which may include the Notes. Any such
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

Electronic distribution

The offering memorandum in electronic format may be made available by e-mail or through other
online services maintained by the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates. In those cases, prospective
investors may view offering terms online and may be allowed to place orders online. The Initial Purchasers may
agree with us to allocate a specific number of Notes for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such
allocation for online distributions will be made by the Initial Purchasers on the same basis as other allocations.
Other than the offering memorandum in electronic format, the information on the Initial Purchasers’ website
and any information contained in any other website maintained by the Initial Purchasers is not part of the
offering memorandum, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or the Initial Purchasers and should not
be relied upon by investors.

###### SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF LIABILITIES

The Issuers are incorporated under the laws of Germany. None of the directors, officers and other
executives of the Issuers and the Guarantors are residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, all of
the assets of the Issuers and all of the assets of the Guarantors and the assets of their respective directors,
officers and executive officers are located outside of the United States. As a result, although we have appointed
an agent for service of process under the Indentures governing the Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve
process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against
them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

Germany

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany
of civil liabilities based on the state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an
action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in
civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United
States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in
Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action
before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of
Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement
of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

    - the judgment being final under U.S. law;

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

    - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely
served complaint;

    - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a
recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

    - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the procedure of a matter pending before a
German court, provided that such matter was pending before a German court before the
U.S. court entered its judgment;

    - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with German public policy,
including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

    - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to
enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

It is doubtful whether a German court would impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in
Germany based solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws. German courts also usually deny the
recognition and enforcement of punitive damages as incompatible with the substantive foundations of German
law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far
as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial
compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery
process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court
in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States.
Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a

###### 465


-----

German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court
may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a
federal or state court of the United States.

The Netherlands

In the absence of an applicable treaty between the United States and the Netherlands, a judgment
obtained against a subsidiary Guarantor in a U.S. Court will not be directly enforced in the Netherlands. In
order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a
competent court of the Netherlands. The relevant Netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a
judgment of a U.S. Court as it deems appropriate. A Dutch court will, under current practice and based on case
law, generally grant the same judgment without re-litigation analysis on the merits if (i) the non-Dutch court
rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has
conducted the proceedings in accordance with the Dutch concept of due process, (ii) that judgment does not
contravene public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands, (iii) the non-Dutch judgment is not in conflict
with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by
a non-Dutch court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided
that the earlier decision can be recognized in The Netherlands, and (iv) the non-Dutch judgment is—according
to the law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and
no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary
to compensate actual losses or damages. The enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The
Netherlands are subject to the Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, a creditor that wants to claim
payment in the Netherlands further to a judgement of a U.S. court as described above, can do so in the
currency stipulated in the U.S. judgement or in the Dutch currency, i.e., in Euro.

Poland

The enforcement of judgments of foreign courts in Poland is subject to treaties and conventions to
which Poland as a party and the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure.

There is no treaty between the United States of America and Poland providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and commercial
matters. Therefore, to judgments of U.S. courts, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure shall apply.
Under these rules, a judgment against the Polish subsidiary guarantor obtained in a U.S. court will be
recognized in Poland except in the following circumstances:

    - the judgment is not final and binding in the jurisdiction in which it was issued;

    - the case belongs to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts;

    - a defendant who has not entered the dispute as to merits has not been served the complaint in a
manner enabling the defendant to defend himself,

    - the party has been deprived of the possibility of defending itself in judicial proceedings;

    - a case regarding the same claim between the same parties was pending in Poland earlier than
before a court of the foreign country;

    - the judgment is contrary to an earlier final and binding judgment of a Polish court or an earlier
final and binding judgment of a foreign court satisfying the conditions for its recognition in
Poland, which was rendered in a case regarding the same claim between the same parties; and

    - the recognition of the judgment would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal
order of Poland.

Enforceability of such judgement further requires that a Polish court issues a decision confirming that
the judgment of the U.S. court is enforceable in Poland. The decision will be issued provided that a given
judgement is enforceable in the United States. Once the motion to declare enforceability is considered and
approved, the court issues a decision to grant an enforceability clause. Enforcement may be initiated as soon
as the decision granting the enforceability clause becomes final and binding. Enforcement actions carried out
by bailiffs under the auspices of Polish courts may be challenged and, therefore, the enforcement of
obligations may ultimately be unsuccessful or time-consuming, even if the U.S. judgment is recognized and
enforceable in Poland.

Luxembourg

The United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial
matters. Therefore, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any US Federal or state
court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the US securities laws, would not directly be
enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a US court may initiate
enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the US judgment by the
District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil
Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the US judgment if it is satisfied
that all of the following conditions are met:

    - the US judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States;

    - the US court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the applicable matter under
applicable US Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the US court is recognized
by Luxembourg private international and local law; the US court has applied the substantive law
as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules according to certain Luxembourg case law, it
is admitted that Luxembourg courts which are asked to grant an exequatur do not have to verify
whether the substantive law actually applied by the US court awarding the judgment was the law
which would have been thus designated;

    - the US judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under
the laws of Luxembourg;

    - the US court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

    - the US judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity
to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and

    - the US judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of
admissibility may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while
other conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future.

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign
judgment, although such a review is not statutorily prohibited.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated
law (i) if the choice of such law was not bona fide or if the foreign law was not pleaded or proved or if pleaded
and proved, the foreign law was contrary to Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or
incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules, and (ii) if its application is manifestly incompatible with
Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of US federal or state
securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an
exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a
monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have
power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the
judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or
debts would be converted into euro.

1 The unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for the first quarter 2019/2020 has been
restated according to IAS 8.42 et. sec. during the financial year 2020/2021 due to overstated accrued
expenses in the reportable segment Germany, incomplete IFRS 16 lease contract data, and the reassessment of the expected useful life of a building, which was understated and such restatement was
included in the unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for the first quarter 2020/2021
and disclosed in the notes thereto. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of
the Parent as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2020 authorized for issue as of February 25,
2021 have been replaced by the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the
Parent authorized for issue as of March 12, 2021.
2 The disclosure note referring to the disaggregation of revenue according to IFRS 15.114 et. seq. attributable
to e-commerce and store sales on a segment level (which we present based on geographical regions) for the
financial year 2019/2020 was not included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial
year 2019/2020 and is presented now according to IAS 8.42 et seq. in the unaudited IFRS interim
consolidated financial information as of and for the three months period ended December 31, 2020 (see the
note “net sales” to our unaudited IFRS interim consolidated financial information as of and for the three

###### Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020

_Chief Operating Decision Maker, reportable and operating segments_

In conformity with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, the reporting segments are categorized based on
their organizational and decision-making structure and the content of the internal reporting to the chief
operating decision-maker. Unchanged to the financial year ending September 30, 2020, the Douglas Group’s
countries are classified as operating segments which are allocated to the reportable segments Germany,
France, South-Western Europe and Eastern Europe.

_Segment Performance Indicator_

The segment performance indicator is Adjusted EBITDA.

Alongside sales, adjusted EBITDA is the Douglas-Group’s key financial performance indicator that is
used to assess the performance of the segments and manage resource allocation.

Segment sales represent sales with external third parties. Intersegment sales present sales between
individual segments. The allocation of segment sales is based on the registered office of the selling unit.

We evaluate each of our business segments using a measure that reflects all the segment’s income
and expenses. We believe the most appropriate measure in this regard is Adjusted EBITDA as it is helpful for
investors as a measurement of the segment’s ability to generate cash and to service financing obligations.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

Internal licensing costs and other similar costs charged from the segment Germany to the segments
South-Western Europe and Eastern Europe were not included in the presentation of segment EBITDA and
adjusted segment EBITDA, in accordance with the internal steering logic.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as follows:

The EBITDA reported in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss is adjusted for those lease
expenses and income in accordance with the former IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance with
IFRS 16. The resulting “key performance indicator to be adjusted” is adjusted for those items which, in the
opinion and decision of the management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, are non-regularly recurring, exceptional
or unsuitable for internal control. Adjusted EBITDA is also decisive for calculating the underlying covenants of
loan financing.

The resulting “key performance indicator to be adjusted” is adjusted for those items which, in the
opinion and decision of the management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, are non-regularly recurring, exceptional
or unsuitable for internal control.

Because not all companies that publish financial information calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
on a uniform basis, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to measures under the same or
similar names used by other companies. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these measures.

_Adjustments_

Adjustments include, but are not limited to PPA effects, consulting fees, restructuring costs, costs such
as credit card fees deemed as financing costs and other extraordinary costs. The definition of adjustments is
unchanged compared to the Kirk Beauty One IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements as at
September 30, 2020.

The adjustments are basically divided into the following five categories: “Credit card fees,” “Purchase
price allocations (PPA),” “Restructuring costs and severance payments,” “Consulting fees” and “Other
adjustments“. In view of the abnormal situation and uniqueness of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain related
expenses and income have also, in the opinion of management, to be adjusted and have been disclosed
separately in the category “COVID-19-effects”.

     - Credit card fees:
Fees charged for the use of credit cards are classified as financial expenses and are reclassified to
these

F-10

###### Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020

    - Purchase Price Allocations (PPA):
EBITDA effects in profit or loss concerning the amortization of hidden reserves disclosed in
connection with business combinations

    - Restructuring costs and severance payments:
Expenses in connection with the sale or termination of a business unit, the permanent closure or
sale of a group of stores, significant changes in the structure of management or fundamental
reorganizations. Within this context, expenses in the form of severance payments and salary
continuation payments without replacement of the position, furthermore in the case of
management positions at national or Group level irrespective of the replacement of the position,
are to be mentioned in particular.

    - Consulting fees:
In relation to strategic projects, acquisitions and financing.

    - COVID-19-effects:
The COVID-19 related lockdown led to several temporary closures of our stores across Europe,
resulting in a significant drop of our overall Net Sales. Furthermore, some of our employees were
on short-time labor which led to a substantial decrease in our personnel expenses.
COVID-19 adjustments particularly resulted from lockdown-caused temporary store closures,
mainly in the form of rent-related idle costs of €7.7 million and staff-related idle costs of
€3.9 million (comprising offsetting effects from payroll-related subsidies, totaling €1.2 million) as
well as costs of €0.5 million for external staffing. Adjustments comprised offsetting effect from
staff-related subsidies, totaling €1.2 million. Additional direct costs amounted to €1.3 million and
especially included expenses for the purchase of hygiene articles such as disinfectants and masks
and cleaning costs amounting to €0.6 million.

     - Other adjustments
Other matters that do not recur on a regular basis, are exceptional or are not suitable for internal
management. These include in particular: Restructuring expenses that are not personnel-related,
write-downs of receivables, impairment losses on inventories if not reported separately due to
materiality, income from the reversal of previously adjusted provisions.

_Other explanations on segment reporting_

The recognized segment sales correspond to sales with external third parties. Internal sales account for
sales between individual segments. The allocation of segment sales is based on the registered office of the selling
unit. The allocation of sales to the reporting segment is based on the registered location of the selling company.

The monthly reporting to the chief operating decision-maker only shows the inventories of individual
segments as segment assets. Inventories shown in segment reporting include purchased goods, raw materials,
consumables and supplies and advance payments for inventories.

Capital expenditure shown in segment reporting relates to additions made to intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment.

Transfers between segments are generally performed at the same prices that would apply if the
transaction were executed with third parties (arm’s length transactions).

General principles

Kirk Beauty One GmbH (Kirk Beauty One, parent company, company) is a German limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), has its registered office at Luise-Rainer-Str. 7-11, 40235
Düsseldorf, Germany and is registered in commercial register B of the district court of Düsseldorf under the
registration number 79429.

Kirk Beauty One and Douglas GmbH issued Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes at GEM segment
of the Irish Stock Exchange in July 2015.

These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements cover the period of the first three months of the
financial year 2020/21 from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (interim period) as of
December 31, 2020 (interim reporting date) and were prepared in compliance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) endorsed by the European Union and mandatory for the financial year 2020/21.

These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34
_Interim Financial Reporting and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s last Annual Consolidated_
Financial Statements for the financial year ending September 30, 2020. They do not include all the information
required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to
explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Company’s
financial position and performance since the last Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in euros (EUR/€). All figures are stated
in millions of euros (EUR m) unless otherwise stated.

Assumption of going concern as the basis for accounting

The financial risks represent a going concern risk for the Douglas-Group. The following material
uncertainties exist:

    - the follow-up refinancing until maturity in 2022 and 2023 must succeed,

    - the necessary and planned increase in earning power in the Group’s transformation process must
be achieved and thus solvency maintained, and

    - the liquidity of the Group must not be further burdened by further delays in opening the stores.

The long-term financing of the Douglas-Group is provided by a senior syndicated loan agreement
including a Revolving Credit Facility and Ancillary Facilities as well as corporate bonds issued. The risk of a lack
of follow-up financing until maturity in 2022 or 2023 for the company’s portfolio is generally and overall
assessed as high, but the occurrence of this risk is considered to be rather low. Overall, the Douglas-Group has
financial resources of €2,505.0 million at its disposal through the senior syndicated loan agreement including
the Revolving Credit Facility and the corporate bonds issued. With the Revolving Credit Facility and the

F-12


-----

###### Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020

Ancillary Facilities drawn down in the amount of €135.3 million as of December 2020, the credit lines are
almost exhausted. According to current planning, the Douglas-Group will not be in a position to repay these
liabilities from its own funds when the non-current financial liabilities mature, so that refinancing will have to be
successful.

During the term of the financing agreements, the Douglas-Group must, among other obligations, in
particular service the cost of capital on time and maintain a certain ratio between adjusted EBITDA and debt
(financial covenant). However, the obligation to comply with the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to debt only arises
when at least 40.0 percent or €80 million (threshold) of the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn by
Revolving Credit Facility Loans.

The ongoing servicing of the cost of capital generally assumes that the Douglas-Group’s planning will
not be significantly missed in terms of sales, earnings and cash flow development.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on the Douglas-Group’s
business. The original plans for sales and earnings for the financial year 2019/20 from October 2019 were
significantly missed.

It is now clear that COVID-19 has also an impact on the Group’s further development in the 2020/21
financial year. At present, a reduction in financing reserves is assumed for the Douglas Group, taking into
account the current lockdown-caused store closures and restrictions in some countries and the assumed
openings from March 2021 on. Each additional week of lockdown-caused store closures further increases the
liquidity risk.

The massive shift in business to digital retail and the compensation for the associated decline in store
business, as well as the adjustment of the store network, are thus seen as a necessary step to increase
profitability.

According to the liquidity planning there are only limited liquidity reserves beyond the reporting date
of September 30, 2021 in order to maintain solvency at all times even in the event of further budget shortfalls
or an extended period of lockdown-caused store closures.

Therefore Douglas-Group may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal
course of business.

Retrospective restatement of comparative information for the first quarter of the prior year ending as of
December 31, 2019

The Group has identified and corrected the following errors in the first quarter of the prior year:

Accrued expenses in the reportable segment Germany were overstated by €23.6 million. As a result,
cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies and merchandise and related trade accounts payable were
overstated.

Some IFRS 16 related postings based on insufficient information were incomplete or incorrect
(especially previously unidentified leases or subleases as well as incorrect lease terms). Based on current
information appropriate correction have been made, with primarily effects on right-of-use assets from leases,
and corresponding financial liabilities as well as financial assets for sub leases.

The expected useful life of a building has been reconsidered. As a result, property plant and
equipment were understated by €13.8 million. The error was corrected in equity partially offset by deferred tax
liabilities.

All restatements of comparative information for the first quarter of the prior financial year 2019/20
have been considered and corrected in the last Annual Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the
financial year ending September 30, 2020.

The errors were corrected by adjusting the affected items in therestatement effects o financial
statements for previous years accordingly. The following tables summarize the effects on the Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements.

###### Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020

Foreign currency transactions are recognized in the functional currency as translated at the applicable
exchange rate at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities nominally denominated in such
foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the interim reporting date. All differences resulting
from currency translation are recognized in profit or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

Accounting and valuation principles

The accounting and valuation principles for the reporting period are substantially consistent with
those applied for the Kirk Beauty One’s Annual Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2020.

In calculating the expense relating to taxes on income, the interim tax expense is determined on the
basis of the estimated effective income tax rate for the current fiscal year.

Comprising the Christmas season and besides events like Black Friday or Singles’ Day, the first quarter
of our fiscal year is measured in terms of Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA the most important quarter, which is
typical for a retailer in the consumer sector. All sales-related, seasonal or cyclical issues have been considered
during the interim financial and business judgement was applied accordingly.

_Use of judgements_

Douglas makes discretionary decisions when determining the term of leases, considering renewal and
/ or termination options. The assessment of whether these options are exercised with sufficient certainty affects
the term and consequently also the measurement of the lease liability and the right of use of a lease. The
classification of lessor-related leases as operating or finance leases is also subject to discretionary decisions.

_Assumptions and estimates_

Assumptions and estimates have been made in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements that impact the disclosure and amount of the assets and liabilities, income and expenses carried in
these statements. These assumptions and estimates were used, particularly, in assessing whether or not there
are any triggering events indicating the need for testing non-financial assets for impairment and the
impairment losses under IFRS 9 with focus on the determination of the probability of occurrence of scenarios
and the credit risk (loss rate), the determination of useful lives and valuing provisions and pension provisions
and uncertain tax positions and estimating the probability that future tax refunds will be realized. Actual values
may vary in individual cases from the assumptions and estimates made. Changes are recognized in income as
soon as more detailed information is known. In particular, the impairments of financial and non-financial assets
were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and may involve greater uncertainty.

The comparative information for the fiscal years ending as of September 30, 2020 and as of
September 30, 2019 have been disclosed for the first time and retrospectively according to IAS 8.42.

Impairment of Assets

Impairment tests at store level, as cash-generating units (CGUs), lead to write-downs totaling
€5.7 million (prior year: €0.0 million), of which €3.3 million (prior year: €0.0 million) were attributable to the
segment Germany, €0.3 million (prior year: €0.0 million) to France, €2.1 million (prior year: €0.0 million) to
South-Western Europe and €0.0 million (prior year: €0.0 million) to Eastern Europe. Triggering events for stores
subject to impairment testing are, in particular, negative contribution margins as a result of a decline in
customer frequency, also due to COVID-19 and planned, approved and announced permanent store closures.

For impairment testing the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is calculated as being the value in use based on discounted future cash flows from internal
forecasts. Planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit/EBITDA forecasts, estimates of replacement
investments in the store network, the ratio of personnel expenses to sales and other cost ratios relating to
individual stores. The forecasts are based on the residual term of the respective lease agreements including
any extension options. The forecast term is between one and fifteen years. Calculations are based on interest
rates of between 5.5 percent and 9.0 percent, before taxes and materially unchanged compared to the last
Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ending September 30, 2020.

We also saw the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as a trigger for performing a goodwill impairment test.
The parameters used in the test are essentially unchanged to those used in the impairment test as of
September 30, 2020; this applies in particular to the planning assumptions. The range of capitalization rates
after taxes is 6.4% to 9.7%. The calculation of the perpetual annuity continues to be based on a risk-adjusted
growth rate of 1%. For operating segments whose value in use was below the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit, the fair value less cost of disposal was also determined. The recoverable amount is in all cases
above the carrying amount, so that there is no need for impairment.

Miscellaneous financial assets comprise several mainly short-term receivables.

Fair values of the Notes liabilities are calculated on the basis of market prices quoted on active
markets (level 1).

A mark-to-market measurement based on yield curves available on the market is conducted for the
interest rate caps presented as derivative financial instruments under “Assets” (level 2).

The contingent purchase price liability associated with the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent of
the shares in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH was recognized as a liability to minority shareholders at its fair value of
€5.3 million as of the reporting date. The remaining 49 percent of the shares were acquired with economic
effect from January 1, 2022 and subject to the condition precedent of payment of the second purchase price
tranche. The purchase price of the 49 percent stake is also determined by the achievement of certain economic
performance indicators. The expected value was determined on the basis of an equal distribution of the
performance indicators within a range around the target achievement level. The expected value was
discounted at an interest rate of 1.5 percent. The sensitivity of the fair value lies between the lower limit of
€3.5 million and the upper limit of €6.0 million.

The contingent purchase price liability associated with the acquisition of the remaining 20 percent of
the shares in Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH was recognized as contingent consideration at its fair value of
€8,0 million as of the reporting date. The put option can take place within a period of 90 days after
October 1, 2021 for the remaining 20 percent of the shares. The purchase price of the 20 percent stake is
nearly fix.

In terms of trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable, fair values equal the carrying
amounts due to the short maturities involved. In case of receivables from the parent company Kirk Beauty Two
GmbH, the carrying amount is identical to the fair value as well, as the interest rate was negotiated in
accordance with standard market conditions.

The IFRS 9-valuation of the receivables from the parent company Kirk Beauty Two GmbH as of
December 31, 2020 resulted in a reversal of former write-down accounting for €75.5 million and is based on
market parameters which are deducted from credit default swaps of a similar rating, without tax effects.

###### Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020

Since then, market interest rates have changed slightly. On the other hand, the credit risk has
increased. Since the carrying amount already takes the credit risk until maturity into account, it substantially
equals fair value still.

Fair values of liabilities to banks are based on expected cash flows of contractual agreements,
discounted with a credit-risk-adjusted rate. Calculating the fair value of the syndicated bank loan, a particularity
exists. In addition to the variable EURIBOR base rate, adjustments to the credit margin are also regularly made
within legally defined boundaries. Credit margins are reassessed on a quarterly basis, regarding the
development of certain corporate key figures. The reassessment is based on ratios that the syndicate would
also include in the assessment of credit risk. As a result, interest expectations as of the reporting date are
largely equivalent to fair credit interest assessment. As there were no interest accruals as of the reporting date,
the fair value only deviates from the nominal value of the liability to an immaterial extent.

Fair values of other financial instruments are calculated using the present values of contractually
agreed payments in consideration of country-specific interest yield curves.

Equity participations are measured at fair value. No sale of these equity participations is planned as of
the reporting date.

Borrowing liabilities

As of December 31, 2020, and as of September 30, 2020 the borrowings comprise Senior Notes and
bank liabilities, including drawn Revolving Credit Facilities and other borrowings as follows:

Carrying amounts include accruals.

The nominal value of the Revolving Credit Facility amounted to €135.3 million at the reporting date,
consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility Loan of €74.3 million and Ancillary Facilities of €61.0 million.
Furthermore, the RCF was utilized by way of collateral in particular in the form of rental guarantees in the
amount of €52.4 million (prior year as of September 30, 2020: €17.4 million).

Kirk Beauty One and its subsidiaries have to meet certain obligations and key financial covenants, in
the event that 40.0 percent of the nominal value of €200 million of the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn
(corresponds to €80 million). The utilization of the RCF through Ancillary Facilities as well as collateral in the
form of rental guarantees is of no significance for the calculation of and compliance with financial covenants.
The Revolving Credit Facility Loan was drawn at €74.3 million as of the reporting date, which corresponds to a
utilization of less than 40 percent of the RCF.

Besides these financial covenants Kirk Beauty One also has to meet certain qualitative covenants. If the
obligations are not met, the lenders are entitled to cancel the loan agreements with immediate effect and call
upon all pledged collateral. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

Hedging of financing liabilities

Interest rate caps (separate financial instruments) are in place to hedge against the risk of interest rate
fluctuations over a variable nominal volume of up to €1,100.0 million and a term until August 31, 2021. As of
the balance sheet date, the nominal volume amounts to €1,100.0 million. The interest rate caps reduce the risk
of an inclining EURIBOR to a maximum of 1.0 percent. The cash flows will affect interest income during the
period from October 1, 2015 through August 31, 2021. The Term Loan B Facility agreement contains an
interest rate floor at 0.0 percent EURIBOR.

Share-based payments

_Second management participation program_

On December 30, 2020, the Company implemented a new share-based payment plan, by establishing
a second management participation company as a shareholder of Kirk Beauty Two GmbH, the direct parent of
Kirk Beauty One GmbH.

Key management personnel and other senior employees were granted a participation in that entity
which allows them to hold an indirect interest in the Douglas-Group and, in the event of the current majority
shareholder departing (through a sale or Initial Public Offering), participate in the anticipated value increase.
The interest granted is composed of ordinary shares in Kirk Beauty Two GmbH representing 5,6% percent of
those shares, and a portion of a shareholder loan, bearing interest at 2%, against Kirk Beauty Two GmbH.

The participation is linked to a service agreement of a member with the group and therefore is subject
to good and bad leaver provisions until an IPO or trade sale occurs. Upon occurrence of a leaver event, the
majority investor may exercise a call option and repurchase the participation at a specified price. Good leavers
will receive a vested portion of the fair value of their participation, with 100% being received after five years.

Since the Company is not obliged to settle any obligation related to the participation in the second
plan, this participation is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment award, which is considered an
option. The grant date fair value is thus derived using an option-pricing model. The total amount of benefits
granted was determined to be €18.6 million. The grant date fair value will be expensed over the variable
vesting period till the expected exit event occurs.

For the second management plan, no personnel expenses were recognized in the first quarter of the
financial year 2020/21.

Events after the interim reporting date

The following events requiring consideration occurred between the Consolidated Financial
Statements reporting date and the date on which the Consolidated Financial Statements were approved for
publication:

_Additional incremental revolving facility of €75 million_

Kirk Beauty One also has access to an incremental Revolving Facility in the amount of €75.0 million,
which has not been utilized.

_The coronavirus pandemic – still ongoing_

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. From January to March 2021 many of our stores were closed
with significant impact on our business, although a large part of the decline in store sales was offset by our very
strong e-commerce business.

_Changed customer behavior - optimization of our store network_

The longstanding trend of shifting from store to e-commerce purchases was further reinforced by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this change in our customers’ consumer behavior, around 500 of the
currently around 2,400 stores across Europe will be closed. The majority of the permanent store closures will
take place in the South-Western Europe region, which is particularly affected by the effects of the coronavirus

pandemic and in which there is a very dense, partially overlapping branch network due to previous
acquisitions. The necessary downsizing of the branch network goes hand in hand with investments in flagship
stores in top locations, product innovations and the consistent expansion of digital retail throughout Europe.
As a result of the above-mentioned measures, we currently expect one-time expenses amounting to €94 million
and sustainable positive effects in the low triple-digit million range.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

Principles

1. General principles

Kirk Beauty One GmbH (Group parent company) is a limited liability company registered at LuiseRainer-Str. 7-11, 40235 Düsseldorf, Germany and is registered in commercial register B of the district court of
Düsseldorf under the registration number 79429.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH and its subsidiaries (Kirk Beauty
One Group, Douglas-Group, Group) as of September 30, 2020 (reporting date) comprise the reporting period
beginning October 1, 2019 until September 30, 2020 (financial year, reporting period).

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH were prepared according to the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Consolidated Financial Statements take into account all
compulsory accounting standards and interpretations in the European Union adopted at that time.

This version of the Consolidated Financial Statements is in accordance with the provisions of
Section 315e HGB (German Commercial Code). This forms the legal basis for accounting processes in
Germany in accordance with international standards, together with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002 on the application of international accounting
standards.

2. Accounting Standards

The financial statements of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements were prepared uniformly according to the applicable IFRS classification, accounting and
measurement principles.

These Consolidated Financial Statements are generally based on the principle of historical cost. The
main exceptions to this are financial instruments recognized at fair value and pension obligations measured
using the projected unit credit method.

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in euros (EUR/€). All amounts are presented in
million euros (EUR m), unless otherwise indicated.

The Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss was generally prepared according to the nature of
expense method. By modification of the reporting structure defined in IAS 1.102, the cost of raw materials,
consumables and supplies and merchandise is reported directly after sales in order to determine “Gross profit
from retail business”, which is significant for retail operations.

The senior parent company is Kirk Beauty S.à r.l. with registered office in Luxembourg, whose business
purpose is the holding of investments in companies. It prepares the Consolidated Financial Statements for the
largest group of consolidated entities published in Luxembourg.

Due to the first-time application of the new lease standard IFRS 16 “Leases”, comparability with prioryear figures is limited in some cases.

_Assumption of going concern as the basis for accounting_

The financial risks represent a going concern risk for the Douglas-Group. The following material
uncertainties exist:

     - the follow-up financing until maturity in 2022 and 2023 must succeed,

     - the necessary and planned increase in earning power in the Group’s transformation process must
be achieved and thus solvency maintained, and

     - the liquidity of the Group must not be further burdened by further delays in opening the
branches.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The long-term financing of the Douglas-Group is provided by a senior syndicated loan agreement
including a Revolving Credit Facility and Ancillary Facilities as well as corporate bonds issued. The risk of a lack
of follow-up financing until maturity in 2022 or 2023 for the company’s portfolio is generally and overall
assessed as high, but the occurrence of this risk is considered to be rather low. Overall, the Douglas-Group has
financial resources of €2,505.0 million at its disposal through the senior syndicated loan agreement including
the Revolving Credit Facility and the corporate bonds issued. With the drawing of the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Ancillary Facilities in the amount of €165.5 million in March 2020, the credit lines are almost exhausted.
According to current planning, the Douglas-Group will not be in a position to repay these liabilities from its
own funds when the non-current financial liabilities mature, so that refinancing will have to be successful.

During the term of the financing agreements, the Douglas-Group must, among other obligations, in
particular service the cost of capital on time and maintain a certain ratio between adjusted EBITDA and debt
(financial covenant). However, the obligation to comply with the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to debt only arises
when at least 40.0 percent or €80 million (threshold) of the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn by
Revolving Credit Facility Loans.

The ongoing servicing of the cost of capital generally assumes that the Douglas-Group’s planning will
not be significantly missed in terms of sales, earnings and cash flow development.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on the Douglas-Group’s
business. The original plans for sales and earnings for the financial year 2019/20 from October 2019 were
significantly missed.

It is now clear that COVID-19 will also impact the Group’s further development in financial year
2020/21. At present, a reduction in financing reserves is assumed for the Douglas Group, taking into account
the current store closures and restrictions in some countries and the assumed openings from February. Each
additional week of store closures further increases the liquidity risk.

The massive shift in business to digital retail and the compensation for the associated decline in store
business, as well as the adjustment of the store network, are thus seen as a necessary step to increase
profitability.

According to the liquidity planning there are only limited liquidity reserves beyond the reporting date
of September 30, 2021 in order to maintain solvency at all times even in the event of further budget shortfalls
or an extended period of store closures.

_New or changed standards and interpretations_

The new standards and interpretations or amendments to existing standards and interpretations
presented below have been applied for the first time in these Consolidated Financial Statements:

The Group applied IFRS 16 (Leases) for the first time as of October 1, 2019. In addition, a number of
other new standards had to be applied for the first time in financial year 2019/20, but these had no material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements ending September 30, 2020.

IFSR 16 replaces the requirements of IAS 17 (Leases) and the related interpretations of IFRIC 4
(Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease), SIC-15 (Operating Leases — Incentives) and SIC-27
(Evaluating the Substance of Transactions in the Legal Form of a Lease).

The scope of IFRS 16 generally includes the accounting treatment of leases. A contract is or contains a
lease if it grants the right to control the use of a specific asset over a specified period of time in return for
payment.

IFRS 16 abolishes the classification of leases into operating leases and finance leases for lessees
required by IAS 17 and replaces it with a uniform accounting model under which lessees are generally required
to recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for leases.

The right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and the vast
majority of the rental expense previously presented under IAS 17 as other operating expenses is now
recognized as depreciation of the right-of-use asset. Furthermore, interest expense results from the ongoing
accrual of interest on the lease liability.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

Due to the presentation of lease payments as financing activities in accordance with IFRS 16, the cash
inflow from operating activities and correspondingly the cash outflow from financing activities increase.

In contrast, IFRS 16 largely retains the rules for lessor accounting in accordance with IAS 17.

With its approximately 2,200 leased retail stores, the Douglas Group as lessee has a considerable
number of leases formerly classified as operating leases under IAS 17. The new IFRS 16 therefore has a
significant impact in the financial year 2019/20, particularly on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
and Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, but also on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method. Comparative information for
the prior financial year 2018/19 has therefore not been adjusted.

Previously, the Group determined at inception whether an arrangement contained or was a lease in
accordance with IFRIC 4 (Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease). The Group now assesses
whether an arrangement is or contains a lease based on the definition of a lease. On transition to IFRS 16, the
Group elected not to apply the transition relief to retain the assessment of which transactions are leases. That
is, the Group applied IFRS 16 to all contracts that contain a lease.

As a lessee, the Group predominantly leases retail stores for the distribution of its perfumery products,
office and warehouse space. The Group has previously classified leases as operating leases or finance leases
based on its assessment of whether the lease has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the underlying asset to the Group. In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group recognizes right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities for these leases.

At the provision date or upon modification of a contract containing a lease component, the Group
allocates the contractually agreed consideration on the basis of the relative individual prices. For real estate
leases, this means that a separation of lease and non-lease components is made so that the payments related
to the non-lease component are recognized in profit or loss.

On transition from IAS 17 to IFRS 16, the lease liabilities for these leases were measured at the present
value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as of October 1,
2019.

The basis for determining the incremental borrowing rate is the risk-free interest rate, which is
determined using the swap curves of the respective currencies of the corresponding lease payments. Since
country risks are already taken into account in these risk-free interest rates, no separate component is added. In
order to reflect the default risk of Douglas and the parent company Kirk Beauty One GmbH, a credit premium
is included. An additional liquidity premium is not required beyond the credit spread. In the next step, a
collateral discount was deducted, which results from the fact that a lease contract provides for a special form of
collateral by the lease object for the lessor. This collateral leads to a better credit rating for the lessee. The final
component of the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate was the term of the lease.

The following shows the interest rate matrix at five-year intervals:

Rights-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted by the amount of
the lease payments made in advance or deferred. The Group applies this approach to all leases.

Deferred payments resulting from leases between the Douglas-Group as lessee and external third
parties were recognized directly in equity at the date of initial application, October 1, 2019.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The Group has taken advantage of a number of other transition reliefs in applying IFRS 16 to leases
formerly classified as operating leases under IAS 17. Specifically, the Group has:

    - neither recognized right-of-use assets nor lease liabilities for leases where the underlying asset is
of low value,

    - The Group leases other assets (e.g. coffee machines, cell phones, etc.) with contractual terms of
up to 12 months. These lease agreements are classified as current and the Group has decided to
make use of the relief provided by IFRS 16.5 and to recognize neither right-of-use assets nor lease
liabilities for these lease agreements.

    - not performed an impairment test and instead assessed whether its leases were onerous
immediately before the date of initial application in accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets),

    - disregarded the initial direct costs when measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial
application, and

    - retroactively determined the term of leases if a contract provides for renewal or termination
options.

The Group is not required to make adjustments for leases in which it is the lessor, except for
subleases, at the IFRS 16transition date. The Group has subleased some of its leased commercial branches.
Under IAS 17, head leases and subleases were classified as operating leases. Under the now mandatory
application of IFRS 16, the Group has concluded that the subleases are essentially finance leases.

The reconciliation of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019 (closing balance in accordance with IAS
17) to October 1, 2019 (opening balance in accordance with IFRS 16) is presented below:

3. Consolidation principles

_Group of consolidated companies_

All German and foreign companies over which Kirk Beauty One GmbH has direct or indirect control
are fully consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Control exists when Kirk Beauty One GmbH

F-37

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

obtains power, when Kirk Beauty One is exposed to variable returns from its investments with the investee and
when it is able to influence these returns. These companies are fully consolidated when the Group obtains
control and deconsolidated when control ceases.

Two companies in which the Group does not hold a majority stake, but on which the Group does have
a significant influence, were not recognized using the at-equity method. These companies solely provide
intercompany services for the Douglas-Group and are of minor importance to the net assets, financial position
and results of operations of the Group due to their extremely low business volumes. In addition, some of these
companies have different reporting dates and do not prepare interim financial statements. Because of this, no
financial information regarding these companies is available as of the reporting date and the fair values cannot
be reliably determined. The carrying amount of these investments recognized under financial assets amounts
to €38 thousand in total.

The list of shareholdings is shown under Note 33, Other explanatory notes.

_Acquisitions_

_Acquisition of Niche Beauty in the financial year 2018/19_

With the aim of further expanding Douglas’ position in the attractive luxury segment, a 51 percent
interest in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH, based in Hamburg, was acquired in July 2019. It was included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the first time as of August 1, 2019. Niche Beauty is of minor significance
for the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Douglas Group in the 2019/20 financial
year.

The purchase price allocation (PPA) of the acquisition of Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH, made in the prior
financial year 2018/19, was completed in the financial year without any change compared to the prior year’s
financial statements.

_Consolidation methods_

Capital consolidation is conducted by offsetting acquisition costs against the Group’s interest in the
consolidated subsidiary’s net assets at fair value on the acquisition date. Any positive differences are
capitalized as goodwill and tested annually for impairment. Any negative differences are recognized in profit or
loss. Any identifiable net assets including hidden reserves and liabilities due to minority shareholders are
carried as non-controlling interests.

Receivables from and corresponding payables to consolidated companies are eliminated against each
other. Interim profits from delivery of goods and rendering of services within the Group are eliminated in the
Consolidated Financial Statements to the extent that these do not relate to sales realized with third parties.
Sales and other income from intercompany delivery of goods and rendering of services are offset against
corresponding expenses.

_Currency translation_

These Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros (Group currency), the functional
currency of the Group parent company. The annual financial statements of foreign subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the same as the Group currency are translated into euros according to the functional
currency concept. The functional currency of the subsidiaries is the currency of the main economic area in
which the subsidiary operates. This is generally the respective national currency.

The assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the reporting date; income and
expenses are generally translated at the exchange rate on the day of the transaction, approximated by the
Group’s average exchange rate for the reporting period. The resulting currency translation differences are
recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income and within reserves in equity.

The following exchange rates were used for currency translation for the annual financial statements of
foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies.

Foreign currency transactions are recognized in the functional currency as translated at the applicable
exchange rate at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate
on the reporting date. All differences resulting from currency translation are recognized in profit or loss in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

4. Accounting and valuation principles

_Intangible assets_

Goodwill arising from capital consolidation, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, is recognized according to the requirements of IFRS 3 and tested
for impairment annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the group of cash-generating units
(CGU) that is expected to profit from synergies arising from the acquisition. A cash-generating unit (CGU) is
defined as an individual retail store or an online shop. The ceiling for goodwill allocation is generally
determined by the operating segment and hence the respective stand-alone country in which Douglas
operates.

If, as part of this impairment test, the company determines that the recoverable amount of the group
of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, associated goodwill is written down and recognized in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed even if the reasons for the impairment cease to exist
in subsequent periods.

Other intangible assets are carried at (amortized) cost. There are no qualifying assets within the
meaning of IAS 23 within the Douglas-Group, so that borrowing costs are not included when calculating
acquisition costs. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are subject to straight-line amortization over their
useful lives and are depreciated on a “pro rata temporis”-basis in the year of purchase.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. These assets are reviewed for
impairment at least once a year and if there are indications of impairment. If the recoverable amount is below
the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are the trademarks Douglas and Nocibé and leasehold
rights in France.

Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are only subject to an impairment test if there are
triggering events indicating impairment.

F-39

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

Reviews must be carried out in subsequent years to see if indications of impairment exist to suggest
that an impairment made in the prior years no longer exists or has been reduced. If this is the case, the
impairment is reversed up to the recoverable amount, but to a maximum of the amortized carrying amount.

The useful lives underpinning the straight-line amortization for intangible assets are determined on
the basis of the estimated useful lives for each asset class and are as follows.

The useful life applied to brands with definite useful lives is 15 years.

_Property, plant and equipment_

Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at (amortized) cost. There are no qualifying assets
within the meaning of IAS 23 within the Douglas-Group, so that borrowing costs are not included when
calculating acquisition costs. Items of property, plant and equipment are subject to straight-line depreciation
over their (expected) useful lives and are depreciated on a “pro rata temporis”-basis in the year of purchase.

An impairment test is conducted for the corresponding asset if indications of impairment exist.
Tangible assets are derecognized when removed or further economic benefits are no longer expected from
that asset’s use. The gain or loss from the disposal of the asset arises from the difference between its net
realizable value and carrying amount.

The useful lives underpinning the straight-line depreciation for property, plant and equipment are
determined on the basis of the estimated useful lives for each asset class and are as follows.

_Leases_

Right-of-use assets arising from leases are presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position and broken down by class of asset in Note 13.

Lease liabilities are reported under non-current or current financial liabilities and explained in more
detail under Note 25, Financial liabilities, and Note 33, Other explanatory notes / Leases.

As a rule, the Douglas-Group acts as lessee, in particular of real estate, and sometimes, in the context
of subleases, also as lessor.

The Douglas-Group predominantly leases retail stores—ca. 2,200 as of September 30, 2020—for the
sale of its perfumery products. The term of the lease agreements is typically between five and ten years. To
ensure the greatest possible flexibility, the majority of the leases contain options, exercisable once or several
times, to extend the leases for a certain number of years after this period (in many cases for a further five years).
Due to its core activities in stationary retailing, the Group generally operates its retail stores on a long-term
basis. Expiring real estate leases are regularly replaced by new, similar real estate leases. The Group estimates
that the potential future lease payments will therefore generally develop steadily in line with general market
trends in real estate rental prices, irrespective of any unexercised term options of the existing individual
agreements.

The leases can generally be terminated unilaterally by the Douglas Group, although in some cases a
contractual penalty may apply in the event of premature termination by the lessee. In some cases, there are
also bilateral termination options. The majority of the lease agreements provide for annual rent adjustments
based on changes in local price indices.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

In principle, there are only a few cases in which Kirk Beauty One GmbH acts as lessor. Essentially, the
Group acts as lessor in those agreements in which a leased property is sublet to a third party (sublease). The
majority of these leases are classified as finance leases. Leases in which Kirk Beauty One GmbH acts as lessor
and the lease is classified as an operating lease are the absolute exception and of minor significance.

Contracts for leased retail stores may give rise to restoration obligations for leasehold improvements,
the discounted value of which is recognized as a provision. The discounted value of the obligation is
capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of the right-of-use asset from leases and amortized over the expected
useful life.

IFRS 16 has been applied for the first time in the financial year 2019/20. Further explanations can be
found in Note 2, Accounting Standards, in the section “New and amended standards and interpretations,”
under Note 13, Right-of-use assets, under Note 25, Financial liabilities, and Note 33, Other explanatory notes /
Leases.

_Financial assets_

Except for current trade accounts receivable and derivatives, all financial instruments are recognized
on the settlement date. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the date on which they arise. Derivatives
that are allocated to the “measured at fair value through profit or loss” category are recognized on the trade
date.

All financial instruments must be measured at fair value upon initial recognition. If financial instruments
are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue are recognized additionally. Current trade accounts receivable are initially measured at the
transaction price.

Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if they are held within a business model solely for the
purpose of collecting the contractual cash flows (business model “hold”) and the contractual terms only result
in interest and principal payments on the outstanding principal amount at specified points in time.

Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held as
part of a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets (business model
“hold and sell”) and the contractual terms only result in interest and principal payments on the outstanding
principal amount at specified points in time.

On initial recognition of an equity investment (e.g. an equity participation) that is not held for trading
purposes, the Group may irrevocably elect to recognize consequential changes in fair value through other
comprehensive income. This choice is made on a case-by-case basis for each investment.

All financial assets that are not measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets are derecognized either upon settlement or when all main opportunities and risks are
transferred.

Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency of the
acquiring Group company at the date of acquisition. An adjustment to the respective closing rate is made on
each reporting date and recognized in profit or loss. Interest income and expense relating to financial assets
are matched to the period in the financial result.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligations have been fulfilled, cancelled or
expired.

_Fair Value_

The input factors used to determine fair value are divided into three hierarchy levels (Level 1, Level 2
and Level 3). Fair value is the price at which an asset would be sold or a liability transferred in an orderly
transaction on the principal market or, if none exists, in the most advantageous market to which the Group has
access on the measurement date. The fair value of a liability reflects the risk of non-performance. Fair value

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

measurements based on Level 1 input factors are price quotations in active markets that can be determined for
the asset being measured, such as quoted prices. Fair value measurements based on factors whose
measurement can be derived directly or indirectly from observable market data fall under Level 2. The
valuation technique used incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in determining the
price of such a transaction. The valuation on Level 3 is based on pricing models which are based on input
factors that are not observable in the market.

Kirk Beauty One Group only measures interest rate caps and options held by non-controlling interests
at fair value.[2] The fair value measurement of interest rate caps falls under the second hierarchy level (level 2), as
the valuation is based on observable market interest rates.

Kirk Beauty One Group measures liabilities from contingent purchase price payments at fair value.[3]
The input factors on which the valuation is based are assigned to level 2 or level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

###### Amortized cost

Amortized cost is determined on acquisition using the effective interest method, less any impairment,
and taking into account discounts and premiums, including directly attributable transaction costs and fees that
form an integral part of the effective interest rate.

For current assets and liabilities, the carrying amount is regarded as an appropriate approximation of
fair value due to the short period between their recognition and maturity.

_Subsequent measurement and gains and losses_

Net gains and losses, including interest and dividend income from financial instruments measured at
fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in profit or loss.

Financial instruments measured at amortized cost are measured using the effective interest method.
Amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, exchange rate differences and impairments
are recognized in profit or loss. Gains or losses from derecognition are also recognized in profit or loss.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The Group recognizes valuation allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets that are not
measured at fair value through profit or loss. For these financial assets—with exception of trade accounts
receivable, which are subject to a simplified approach—initial recognition in level 1 of the “expected credit loss
model” involves a determination of the expected credit loss from a default event in the twelve months following
the financial statement date or a shorter period, if the expected term is less than twelve months at the financial
statement date. If there is a significant increase in credit risk, it is transferred to level 2 of the model. For these
financial instruments and for trade accounts receivable, credit losses over the total term to maturity are
determined on level 2 of the general model. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the financial assets
are assigned to level 3 of the model. The expected credit losses are determined on an individual item basis
depending on various factors, e.g. past due, counterparties and country risks.

Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to the general model of expected
credit losses. As the counterparties are exclusively counterparties with at least an investment grade rating
(BBB+ or higher), a low credit risk is assumed for these financial instruments.

If the requirements for a low credit risk are not met, an assessment of the change in credit risk is
required. In determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and in estimating expected credit losses, Kirk Beauty One GmbH takes into account appropriate
information that is relevant and available without undue expense of time and money. For other financial assets
carried at amortized cost, the credit risk is continuously monitored on the basis of bond quotes and ratings if
these are available in liquid form. Furthermore, a significantly increased credit risk is assumed when a financial
asset is more than 30 days overdue.

There is objective evidence of impairment if Kirk Beauty One GmbH anticipates adverse effects on
expected cash flows. These include, for example, significant financial difficulties on the part of the issuer or
debtor, indications of insolvency or other restructuring proceedings as well as deterioration in market
conditions. In this sense, financial assets are deemed to have defaulted if they are more than 90 days overdue.
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written down if a reasonable estimate is that the financial asset
will not be recoverable in full or in part.

12-months credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses resulting from default events that are
possible within twelve months of the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected maturity is less than
twelve months).

Expenses or income from impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses for expected credit
losses on financial assets are reported under the line item “Result from impairments on financial assets” in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Impairment losses for financial assets in the general approach are
insignificant.

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are in place to reduce cash flow fluctuations. Derivative financial
instruments are neither used nor issued for speculative purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value both upon initial and subsequent
measurement. This value can be positive or negative; if it is positive, an asset is recognized; if it is negative, a
liability is recognized. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to the amount the Group
company either would have to pay or would receive upon termination of the financial instrument on the
reporting date. The calculation of the fair value takes into account the interest rates and forward rates in effect
as of the financial statement date.

Gains and losses from fair value measurement, to the extent that they relate to designated derivative
financial instruments qualifying as hedged items, are recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item
in line with the rules for hedge accounting.

Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedged items to hedge against cash flow risks
are measured at fair value and recognized in profit or loss. The amounts recorded under equity increase or
reduce profit or loss as soon as the hedged cash flows from the underlying transaction are recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

With regard to currency rate risks non-derivative financial liabilities as part of a net investment hedge
are implemented to cover currency rate risks arising from net investments in non-Group foreign currencies.
Accounting for net investment hedges generally follows the rules for cash flow hedges.

No business transactions to be recognized under the rules for hedge accounting existed either as of
the financial statement date or as of the prior-year financial statement date.

_Trade accounts receivable and other receivables_

Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the transaction price and other receivables are
recognized at fair value at the time of revenue recognition. For subsequent measurement, please refer to the
preceding explanations in the section “Financial assets” and Note 17, Trade accounts receivable.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents, which include money accounts and short-term money deposits with banks,
are measured at amortized cost, based on the business model „hold” and the fulfilment of the cash flow
criterion, and have residual terms of a maximum of three months at the point of acquisition.

_Inventories_

Merchandise is recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Acquisition costs are
identified either by using the average cost method or, in some minor countries, by using the retail method

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

based on the selling price using reasonable valuation allowance deductions. Interest on borrowings is not
included in the acquisition costs, as inventories, most of which constitute acquired trading merchandise, are
not qualifying assets as defined by IAS 23. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated costs necessary to sell the inventory. Ageing as well as fashion and other
risks were considered, to the extent needed, as part of measurement at the net realizable value. Raw materials,
consumables and supplies are recognized at their acquisition costs.

_Income taxes_

Tax expenses comprise both current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in
profit or loss, except for those associated with a business combination or items recognized directly in equity or
in other comprehensive income.

_Current taxes_

Current taxes constitute anticipated tax liabilities or assets on the taxable income or loss generated in
the reporting period, calculated on the basis of tax rates applying on the reporting date or shortly afterwards,
as well as adjustments to tax liabilities or assets in previous periods. The amount of the anticipated tax liabilities
or assets represents a best estimate in consideration of uncertain tax situations, if applicable. Current tax
liabilities also include all tax liabilities resulting from the declaration of dividends.

_Deferred taxes_

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax base to the extent that these differences will lead to tax refunds
or charges in future. Deferred taxes are measured taking into account the tax rates and tax regulations which
are expected to be in force when the differences are reversed. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the
extent that there is taxable income expected on the date on which the difference is reversed.

If the future tax advantage from loss carryforwards can be utilized with sufficient certainty in future
periods, deferred tax assets are recognized. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities if such
liabilities exist against the same tax authority.

_Provisions_

Provisions are recognized if there is a legal or constructive obligation to third parties arising from past
events and if the future cash outflow to fulfill this commitment can be estimated reliably. The carrying amount
of the provision is based—for individual risks—on the best estimate of the settlement considering all
recognizable risks, or—for a large population of risks—the amount computed according to the expected value
method. Non-current provisions are recognized at their present value as of the reporting date. The maturity of
long-term human resources commitments is based on the date the employee leaves the company or on the
timing of forecasted cash outflows. The maturity of long-term real estate commitments is based on the term of
the lease contract or the estimated date of an early termination of the lease contract. Provisions for restoration
obligations are recognized if contractual agreements and experience show that there is a probability of at least
50 percent that claims will be made against Kirk Beauty One Group from this obligation. Provisions for
restructuring measures are recognized if a constructive obligation to restructure was formalized as of the
reporting date. This is the case if a detailed restructuring plan has been formally adopted and its key elements
communicated vis-à-vis those affected or if the implementation of the plan has already begun. Restructuring
provisions only comprise obligatory restructuring expenses.

Provisions for pensions are accounted for in line with the requirements of IAS 19. Actuarial calculations
of provisions for defined benefit plans use the projected unit credit method. As part of this measurement, the
pensions and entitlements known on the reporting date are taken into account as well as the increases in
salaries and pensions to be expected in future. For funded pension plans, the same interest rate chosen to
determine interest expenses resulting from the measurement of obligations is also to be used to calculate
interest income from plan assets. If changes to these calculation assumptions result in differences between the
identified pension obligations and the pension obligations determined as of the financial statement date,
actuarial gains or losses arise. These actuarial gains and losses and other valuation changes are recognized
directly in other comprehensive income and within reserves in equity.

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

Plan assets designated at fair value and liabilities from pension plans are presented in a net amount.
Plan assets are maintained in qualified policies that are pledged to the employees. The interest portion
included in pension expense is presented as interest expense within the financial result. Obligations similar to
pension provisions such as part-time work schemes and termination benefits are also disclosed according to
the requirements of IAS 19.

_Financial liabilities_

With the exception of contingent purchase price obligations resulting from business combinations,
financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition are included in the recognition of financial liabilities. If there is
a difference between the amount paid and the amount to be paid upon final maturity, this difference is
amortized over the term according to the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities are derecognized
when the obligation is extinguished or expired (e.g. limitation of time). A financial liability is also derecognized
if there has been a material change in the contractual terms of an existing financial liability or part thereof. All
trade accounts payable have a maturity of less than one year and are non-interest bearing. Kirk Beauty One
Group recognizes liabilities at amortized costs comprising liabilities to banks, liabilities from Senior Notes and
trade accounts payable. The election to initially recognize financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
was not applied by the Kirk Beauty One Group.

_Contract liabilities_

A basic impact of IFRS 15 concerns options regularly granted as part of customer loyalty programs, to
acquire additional goods or services at a discounted price in the future. With the initial sale, part of the
transaction price must be allocated to the resulting option. Sales will be accrued as contract liability under
other financial liabilities. Revenue recognition for the option occurs at the time the right is redeemed or
expired.

Participants in the Douglas-Group’s customer loyalty programs receive bonus points from purchases
made, which they can exchange for discount vouchers for subsequent purchases when certain thresholds are
reached. The bonus points represent independently identifiable goods or services within the meaning of IFRS
15 and are therefore to be recognized as a separate performance obligation. Upon purchase, the transaction
price is allocated to the independent performance obligations on the basis of the relative individual sale prices.
For the Douglas-Group, the transaction price corresponds to the sales price of the goods and services
purchased by the customer. In the absence of observable individual sales prices for the bonus points, these are
estimated on the basis of the price discount, taking into account probabilities of redemption. A contract liability
is recognized under other financial liabilities in the amount of the performance obligation attributable to the
bonus points granted. The contractual liability is released when the bonus points are redeemed or expire.

_Government Grants_

Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be
received and the entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them. Government grants related to
specific expenses are recognized as a deduction from those expenses. The grants are recognized in the period
in which the expenses that are to be compensated by the government grants are recognized.

_Revenue recognition_

Sales are recognized on delivery of goods to the customer or after the performance of a service is
complete. Obligations from customer loyalty programs, such as bonus points, are measured at fair value and
offset directly against sales. Sales arising therefrom are first recognized upon redemption of the bonus points.
Deferred sales are reversed or utilized in line with the way customers redeem their gift vouchers and are also
reported under sales. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in the financial result on an accrual
basis.

_Use of judgements_

Douglas makes discretionary decisions when determining the term of leases, taking into account
renewal and / or termination options. The assessment of whether these options are exercised with sufficient
certainty affects the term and consequently also the measurement of the lease liability and the right of use of a
lease. The classification of lessor-related leases as operating or finance leases is also subject to discretionary
decisions.

Impairment losses under IFRS 9 are based on judgments, particularly with regard to the determination
of the probability of occurrence of scenarios and the credit risk (loss rate).

_Assumptions and estimates_

Assumptions and estimates have been made in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements that impact the disclosure and amount of the assets and liabilities, income and expenses carried in
these statements. These assumptions and estimates were used, in particular, in the determination of useful
lives[4], valuing provisions and pension provisions[5], assessing the impairment of goodwill[6], measuring
provisions[7] and uncertain tax positions and measuring instruments which are issued as part of share-based
payment programs[8] as well as estimating the probability that future tax refunds will be realized. In addition,
assumptions and estimates are of significance in determining the fair values and acquisition costs associated
with business combinations. Actual values may vary in individual cases from the assumptions and estimates
made. Changes are recognized in income as soon as more detailed information is known. In particular, the
assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and the estimation of the realizability of future tax relief were
significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The discount rate used to measure provisions for pensions and similar obligations of the German
Group companies was estimated for the first time as of September 30, 2020 on the basis of a modified
selection of high-quality corporate bonds. This more precise selection leads to an increase in the discount rate
of 0.35 percentage points compared to the previous system, corresponding to a reduction in the defined
benefit obligation of approximately €1.5 million.

As in the prior year, impairment losses on trade accounts receivable classified to the category
“measured at amortized cost” are reported under other operating expenses, unless they are determined using
the expected credit loss model according to IFRS 9. These impairment losses are shown separately in the
income statement. Fair value measurement of financial assets classified to the category “at fair value through
profit or loss” leads to a financial expense of €0.1 million (prior year: €1.7 million) in the financial year.

The actual tax result includes tax expenses for prior years amounting to €7.9 million (prior year: €27.2
million). These mainly result from findings of ongoing tax audits in France (in the prior year in France and in
Germany).

Deferred tax expenses from temporary differences include expenses of €40.5 million (prior year: €0.0
million) resulting from additions to the valuation allowance or the non-recognition of deferred tax assets. The
valuation allowances mainly relate to the German tax group.

The expected weighted tax rate (32 percent, consisting of 15.8 percent corporate income tax and 16.2
percent trade tax) is basically the same as the tax rate of the Group parent company. In France, a change in the
tax rate from 34.4 percent to now 28.9 percent resulted in tax income of €1.0 million in the financial year
2019/20.

14. Impairment of assets according to IAS 36

Impairment tests at store level, as cash-generating units (CGUs), lead to write-downs totaling
€19.6 million (prior year: €7.8 million), of which €10.2 million (prior year: €4.3 million) were attributable to the
segment Germany, €3.2 million (prior year: €2.1 million) to France, €5.0 million (prior year: €0.8 million) to
South-Western Europe and €1.2 million (prior year: €0.6 million) to Eastern Europe. Triggering events for
subjecting stores to impairment testing are, in particular, negative contribution margins as a result of a decline
in customer frequency, also due to Corona, and planned store closures.

For impairment testing the carrying amount of the CGU or rather groups of CGUs is compared to its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as being the value in use based on discounted
future cash flows from internal forecasts. Planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit/EBITDA
forecasts, estimates of replacement investments in the store network, the ratio of personnel expenses to sales
and other cost ratios relating to individual stores. The forecasts are based on the residual term of the respective
lease agreements including any extension options. The forecast term is between one and fifteen years.
Calculations are based on interest rates of between 5.5 percent and 9.0 percent (prior year: between 5.1
percent and 9.2 percent) before taxes.

The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives amounted to a total of
€1,963.4 million (prior year: €2,253.9 million) as of the reporting date, of which €1,234.0 million (prior year:
€1,513.7 million) is attributable to goodwill. A further €534.4 million is attributable to the Douglas brand, as in
the prior year, and €172.7 million to the Nocibé brand, as in the prior year. As the brands are powered by
ongoing brand maintenance measures, the Group considers their useful lives to be indefinite. The Douglas
brand was allocated to the relevant operating segments for the purposes of impairment testing (thereof
€247.8 million to Germany, €77.9 million to Italy, €50.1 million to the Netherlands and €41.8 million to Poland);
the Nocibé brand was exclusively allocated to France. In addition, French location advantages associated with
leasehold interests purchased from prior tenants were capitalized at €22.3 million (prior year: €33.1 million) in
relation to the useful lives and irrespective of the terms of the lease contracts.

Goodwill, trademarks with indefinite useful lives and location advantages associated with leasehold
interests with indefinite useful lives are subject to impairment testing once each year.

As is the case for impairment tests for tangible assets, the carrying amount of the CGU (or groups of
CGUs) is compared to the recoverable amount of the CGU (or groups of CGUs).

With the exception of brands, the recoverable amount is defined in the Kirk Beauty One Group as the
value in use based on discounted future cash flows from internal forecasts. Planning assumptions include sales
growth, adjusted EBITDA expectations and estimated perpetual growth rate and cost of capital.

For the brands, the recoverable amount is the fair value (level 3) determined using a recognized
valuation technique (license price analogy). The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the brands
are the change in sales revenue, the license rate and the cost of capital. A sales-related license rate was derived
from the earnings contributions generated with the brand and a typified licensor share.

The following table shows the allocation of goodwill to reportable and operating segments.

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The underlying forecasts used to determine the value in use are based on detailed forecast periods of
three years, which corresponds to the companies’ standardized forecasting system, and the perpetual annuity
applying from this point.

Due to the Corona-related lower sales in the financial year 2019/20 and the planned expansion of the
online sales share, we are assuming strong average annual sales growth for the France and Italy operating
segments in the detailed planning phase, significantly growing sales in the Netherlands and strongly growing
sales in Germany. In Poland, particularly strong annual sales growth is expected. In all the countries described
here, we expect a slight increase in market share. In general, we expect that our market penetration on the one
hand and the implementation of efficiency enhancement measures on the other will enable us to largely offset
future increases in costs, so that we anticipate virtually unchanged adjusted EBITDA margins in Germany, the
Netherlands and Italy, moderately growing adjusted EBITDA margins in Poland and moderately declining
adjusted EBITDA margins in France. All other business segments not mentioned here only play a minor role
regarding the amount of goodwill allocated to them.

The calculation of the perpetual annuity is based on a risk-adjusted growth rate of 1.0 percent.

The following interest rates were applied for discounting purposes.

Impairment testing of goodwill resulted in goodwill impairment losses in the amount of €279.7 million
(prior year: €0.0 million) in the reporting period. In addition, the impairment test of intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives (location advantages associated with lease agreements in operating segment France)
resulted in an impairment loss in segment France of €9.3 million in the reporting period (prior year: €0.0
million).

The impairment losses relate to the reportable segment Germany in the amount of €157.1 million, the
reportable segment South-Western Europe in the amount of €116.3 million and the reportable segment
Eastern Europe in the amount of €6.4 million. In the reportable segment South-Western Europe, impairment
losses relate to the operating segment Italy with a goodwill impairment loss of €113.7 million, the operating
segment Austria with €2.5 million and Portugal with less than €0.1 million. In Eastern Europe, the operating
segment Romania was affected by impairment losses on goodwill in the amount of €5.5 million, the operating
segment Croatia accounted for €0.8 million and the Czech Republic for less than €0.1 million. The recoverable
amount for the business segment Germany was €632.0 million, for Italy €134.0 million, for Austria €71.3 million,
for Portugal €22.0 million, for Romania €11.8 million, for Croatia €12.5 million and for the Czech Republic €10.1
million.

The key planning assumptions for operating segment Germany in estimating value in use were
revenue growth over the next three financial years of 8.6 percent on average, with adjusted EBITDA margins in
the range of 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent. Due to the impairment loss recognized for Germany, the recoverable
amount was equal to the carrying amount. Consequently, any unfavorable development of a material
assumption would lead to a further impairment loss.

15. Deferred taxes

Deferred taxes are calculated on the differences between the IFRS carrying amount and the tax base
and can be broken down to the individual financial statement items as follows.

The temporary differences taken as a basis for the calculation of deferred taxes mainly result from fair
value measurements of assets in the course of business combinations as well as the revaluation of financial
assets in accordance with IFRS 9. Deferred tax expenses in the amount of €0.3 million (prior year: €0.7 million)
for pension provisions were directly recognized in other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2020,
there are further tax loss carryforwards of €267.4 million (prior year: €314.1 million) for which no deferred tax
assets have been recognized. Of this amount, €4.5 million (prior year: €12.4 million) will expire in the next five
to seven years. Tax loss carryforwards in the amount of €0.1 million (prior year: €8.7 million), for which no
deferred tax assets had been recognized, were utilized in the period under review.

Deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards were recognized for entities which forecasts gave substantial
indications of recoverability.

In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax liabilities are recognized on the difference between the equity
share of a subsidiary included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the carrying amount of
the investment in the subsidiary recognized in the parent company’s tax balance sheet (outside basis
differences), if realization is expected. As of the reporting date, outside basis differences amounted to
€19.2 million (prior year: €19.2 million), for which no deferred taxes were recognized.

Write-downs to the net realizable value resulted in impairment losses of €24.9 million in the period
ended September 30, 2020 (prior year: €32.6 million).

Inventories are regularly subject to the customary retention of title.

17. Trade accounts receivable

Trade accounts receivable primarily include receivables from credit card organizations as well as from
Douglas Card customers.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

Values determined using the expected credit loss model in accordance with IFRS 9 are presented
separately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Trade accounts receivable are due immediately, do
not bear interest and are therefore not exposed to any interest rate risk. The carrying amounts of the
receivables are basically equivalent to their fair values. The maximum default risk as of the reporting date
corresponds to the carrying amount.

_Assessment of expected credit losses_

In order to estimate the expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable, an allowance matrix is
used.

The default risk is mainly influenced by individual characteristics of customers and the geographical
location. In order to calculate expected credit losses, trade accounts receivable with comparable credit risk
characteristics are classified into different portfolios based on geographical location and customer
characteristics. Historical patterns of payment behavior and the ageing structure of receivables are analyzed
individually for each portfolio and used as a starting point for determining the loss rate. Together with the
amount at risk of default, the expected credit loss is determined for each portfolio and maturity band. The
calculated loss rate per portfolio is adjusted downstream if significant changes in the macroeconomic situation
are expected.

The following table provides information on the estimated credit risk and expected credit losses for
trade accounts receivable and contract assets as of September 30, 2020.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

Prior year’s additions were adjusted by €9.3 million due to better information, with no effect on the
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss or the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

18. Financial assets

Financial assets include long-term receivables from shareholders, bonus/advertising cost subsidies,
equity participations, lease receivables and other financial receivables. Except for equity participations,
financial assets are classified and measured on the basis of the business model and the cash flow criterion; they
are managed within the business model “hold” and the cash flow criterion is considered fulfilled.
Consequently, they are measured at amortized cost, except for equity participations.

Equity participations represent financial investments in unlisted equity instruments. There was no
intention to sell said equity participations as of the reporting date. Depending on how the equity instruments
are managed, they are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Receivables against shareholders are interest-bearing. The gross receivable from the shareholder, Kirk
Beauty Two GmbH, is subordinated in the amount of €507.3 million.

Receivables from supplier bonuses and advertising subsidies are due in the short term and do not
bear interest.

The carrying amount of the equity participation in the GPD Group was fully impaired, with impairment
losses amounting to €3.2 million in financial year 2019/20.

All other financial assets are non-interest-bearing financial instruments. The carrying amounts of other
financial assets are basically equivalent to their fair values.

As of the reporting date, other financial assets in the amount of €0.0 million (prior year: €0.0 million)
had been pledged as collateral for bank loans and Senior Notes.

The level 2 impairment relates to receivables from the shareholder Kirk Beauty Two GmbH with a
gross carrying amount of €986.4 million (prior year: €625.7 million). The classification results from liquidly
traded bonds of the shareholder’s investment, which are quoted below the issue price. The credit risk was
derived from rating-equivalent credit default swaps.

The credit risk was derived from credit default swaps, based on a “CCC+” rating (Moody’s) dated
June 3, 2020, which results in a probability of default depending on the remaining term and a loss given
default of 69 percent (prior year: 63 percent). The contracts contain termination rights which are not shown
separately in the statement of financial position and which are taken into account in the credit exposure via
various scenarios. There is no objective evidence of impairment or a fundamentally impaired creditworthiness
for these receivables.

_Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities_

The amounts not offset in the statement of financial position include both derivative financial
instruments (interest rate caps) and their outstanding purchase price payment. Set-off agreements or similar
agreements exist for these financial instruments; however, they do not meet the set-off criteria according to IAS
32.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

19. Other assets

Other assets primarily include prepaid expenses.

20. Cash and cash equivalents

The largest item of cash and cash equivalents is bank balances (original term up to 3 months). It also
includes checks and cash in hand. Cash and cash equivalents represent highly liquid financial investments that
can be converted into cash at any time and are only subject to insignificant fluctuations in value. The
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides a detailed analysis of the movement in cash and cash
equivalents. The maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying value as of the reporting date.

Kirk Beauty One GmbH allocates cash and cash equivalents to the business model “hold”. Based on
the business model and the fulfilment of the cash flow criterion, cash and cash equivalents are measured at
amortized cost. All carrying amounts correspond to the fair values.

Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to the general approach of the
expected credit loss model. As Kirk Beauty One GmbH only makes investments in counterparties with at least
investment grade rating (BBB-), a low credit risk is assumed for these financial instruments. Kirk Beauty One
GmbH uses credit default swap spreads and rating information to determine the expected credit losses for
cash and cash equivalents. The calculated amount of expected credit losses is insignificant.

As of the reporting date, bank balances in the amount of €221.9 million (prior year: €52.9 million) had
been pledged as collateral for bank loans and Senior Notes. Under the terms of agreement, all rights and
powers in respect of the accounts may be fully exercised so that the pledged bank balances continue to form
part of cash and cash equivalents.

Security can only be enforced by the lenders if the majority of them instruct the agent to make the
debt due and payable with immediate effect. This requires a prior breach of the terms of the contract, which
has not been resolved before the expiration of a specified grace period.

21. Equity

_Capital stock_

Issued capital stock remained unchanged at €25,000.00 on the reporting date. Capital was entirely
paid in.

_Additional paid-in capital_

Additional paid-in capital includes capital contributions of Kirk Beauty One GmbH shareholders in
excess of subscribed capital.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

period from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020, a loss for the period, before profit or loss transfer,
of €319.6 million (prior year: €2.8 million) was incurred and compensated by Kirk Beauty Two GmbH. The loss
compensation is disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Group Equity as a transaction with shareholders.

_Share-based payments_

A management participation program for key employees and other executive employees of the Group
has been set up in a management participation company, established as a shareholder of Kirk Beauty
International S.A., a company above the group of consolidated companies of Kirk Beauty One GmbH. This
management participation program allows the management and other management personnel to invest in the
Douglas-Group and, in the event of the current majority shareholder departing (through a sale or IPO),
participate in the anticipated value increase. The management participation program grants members the
opportunity to indirectly acquire shares in Kirk Beauty International S.A. in a particular structure. The
participants’ investment allows them to indirectly participate in the returns and value developments of a
defined portfolio consisting of ordinary shares, preferred shares and preferred equity certificates (PECs).
Preferred shares and PECs have defined returns on capital employed. PECs take precedence over preferred
shares, which in turn take precedence over ordinary shares, when it comes to servicing.

Given that Kirk Beauty One Group companies are not obliged to settle share-based payments
themselves, this constitutes a share-based payment with settlement through equity instruments in accordance
with IFRS 2.43B (b).

The purchase prices for the transfer of shares to members of the management participation program
who joined the program when it was established were determined on the basis of the purchase price of the
former Beauty Holding Group (now Kirk Beauty One Group) on August 13, 2015. The purchase prices of the
shares of participants who joined the program at a later date were determined according to the portfolio value
calculated on the basis of a mark-to- market valuation of the Group (using the latest company planning and
multiples derived from market data). In valuing the preferred shares and the PECs, the amount of the
contractually agreed accumulated interest and preferred dividends amortized to the accession date (grant
date) is taken into consideration.

Members may only sell acquired shares to Kirk Beauty Investments S.A. If a member leaves the
program, Kirk Beauty Investments S.A. is entitled to buy back his shares (call option).

If they sell their shares prematurely or leave the Kirk Beauty One Group as “good leavers,” members
shall receive a payment for a contractually defined share of the portfolio, which is vested until the date of
departure, equating to the higher of the current market value of the shares or the purchase price less any
received reimbursements. For the non-vested share, “good leavers” receive the lower of the current market
value or the purchase price less any received reimbursements. Five years after the accession date, “good
leavers” receive 100 percent of the market value of their portfolio upon termination. “Bad leavers” receive the
lower of current market value and purchase price.

If a defined exit event occurs (which may include an initial public offering or a similar transaction, in
which all or substantially all of the Group’s assets are sold, so that the current investors retain less than 50
percent of the shares), the proceeds from the sale, after the deduction of costs, will be used to service the
above-mentioned instruments, including accrued interest, in the following order: PECs, preferred shares and
lastly ordinary shares. Investors are required to cooperate in an exit event and participate pro rata in the
proceeds of the sale in accordance with the portfolio they hold.

In order to determine IFRS 2 personnel expense for the period, the purchase prices to be paid by plan
participants were compared to the fair values of the share classes at the respective accession date (grant date).
If plan participants have purchased instruments at a price below fair value, the grant date fair value is
determined as the difference between purchase price and fair value at the accession date. Fair values of the
instruments were determined by means of discounted cash flow assessments of the Kirk Beauty One Group,
based on business plans valid on the grant dates, taking into account the seasonal development of working
capital and the change in net debt. The cost of capital parameters were derived on a quarterly basis and
include the risk-free interest calculated using the Svensson methodology, the relevant market risk premium, the
average unlevered beta and debt-equity ratio derived from the applicable peer group and a country- specific
weighted tax rate. In addition, a weighted country-specific risk premium according to Damodaran and a credit
spread between a ten-year German government bond and a bond determined using a synthetic rating of the
Kirk Beauty One Group were taken into account.

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The resulting enterprise value has been allocated to the different share classes and PECs, taking into
account the nominal values of PECs and preferred shares as option prices for the valuation of the classes of
instruments according to the Black-Scholes method, including contractual and accumulated interest and
preferred dividend amounts and any repurchase programs as of the accession date. Black-Scholes models
were calculated using the same assumptions regarding risk- free interest rate, volatility and expected maturity
of the program, which was set at five years beginning August 15, 2015. It was also assumed that no plan
participants will leave the program within the remaining term and that no dividends will be paid or repurchase
programs will be executed. The calculation of purchase prices per instrument for the three share classes takes
into account a discount for the lack of marketability (“DLOM”) of the two share classes and the PECs. DLOM was
determined using the Finnerty approach.

The parameters used in calculation are as follows.

As no shares were issued in financial year 2019/20, a new valuation at the grant date was obsolete.

The fair values of benefits granted to employees at the inception of the program were as follows:
ordinary shares 3.25 Euro, preferred shares 0.00 Euro and PECs 0.00 Euro.

No shares were issued in the financial year. The weighted average fair value of the benefits arising
from the new shares issued to employees in the prior year was 0.19 Euro per share for ordinary shares, 0.00
Euro for preferred shares and 0.00 Euro for PECs.

The weighted average of the purchase prices of the shares issued to the plan participants existing at
the reporting date is 1.12 Euro (prior year: 1.11 Euro) for the ordinary shares, 1.16 Euro (prior year: 1.15 Euro)
for the preferred shares and 0.01 Euro (prior year: 0.01 Euro) for the PECs. The purchase prices of the ordinary
shares ranged from 0.00 Euro to 7.41 Euro, the preferred shares from 1.00 Euro to 1.42 Euro and the PECs
from 0.01 Euro.

settled share-based payment program, the grant date fair value of benefits granted in the form of instruments
is recorded as personnel expense over the vesting period; the offsetting entry is made in other reserves in
equity. Personnel expenses from share-based payments of €0.2 million (prior year: €0.2 million) were recorded
for the period ended September 30, 2020.

22. Pension provisions

Pension provisions are recognized for funded and non-funded employer-financed commitments
arising from pension entitlements and ongoing payments to employees and former employees as well as their
surviving dependents. They are also recognized for purely employee-funded commitments from deferred
compensation. The pension entitlements usually relate to payments for contractually agreed retirement
pensions as a monthly amount. These commitments are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of
IAS 19. Accordingly, actuarial gains/losses are recognized directly and in full via a separate equity component.

Valuations are based on actuarial reports using the following parameters.

Pension payments in the amount of €2.2 million and contributions to plan assets in the amount of
€0.4 million are expected for the period ended September 30, 2021. An increase of 0.7 percentage points in
the discount rate would reduce the present value of the defined benefit obligations by €5.3 million. A decrease
of 0.7 percentage points in the discount rate would increase the benefit obligations by €6.2 million. An increase
or a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in the expected pension trend with all other parameters remaining
unchanged would increase the present value of the defined benefit obligations by €2.9 million or decrease the
present value of the defined benefit obligations by €1.6 million, respectively. The weighted average duration of
all obligations is 14.9 years as of the reporting date.

cancellation rights with the consequence that in the event of termination, compensation at fair value would be

the financial statement date.

The contingent selling price for the shares in Profumerie Douglas S.p.A. agreed in connection with the
acquisition of the Limoni and La Gardenia Group with the parent company of the selling companies, Orlando
Italy S.r.l., was recognized in the prior financial year at its fair value of €15.0 million as a liability to minority
shareholders as of the financial statement date and was settled in full in the financial year 2019/20.

The fair value of the minimum purchase price liability for the acquisition of the remaining minority
interests in Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH in the amount of €7.9 million (prior year: €7.6 million) is presented as a
liability to minority shareholders as well.

The contingent purchase price liability associated with the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent
interest in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH was recognized at its fair value of €5.3 million (prior year: €5.2 million) as

###### Further disclosures

27. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows shows how the Group’s cash and cash equivalents have
changed in the course of the financial year as a result of cash inflows and outflows. The Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows distinguishes between changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €256.3 million (prior year: €81.0 million) as of September 30,
2020 and consisted exclusively of cash and cash equivalents as reported in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

Cash inflow from operating activities totaled €523.0 million (prior year: €198.3 million) in the financial
year 2019/20, of which €278.0 million resulted from the reclassification of rental payments to cash flows from
financing activities in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 16 in financial year 2019/20. The rental
payments previously reported as cash outflow from operating activities are now largely classified as
repayments of lease liabilities and thus as financing activities.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The increase in provisions of €5.8 million (prior year: €29.4 million) includes the change in non- current
and current provisions, in the prior year corrected for additions from company acquisitions, which are reported
in cash flow from investing activities. Changes in working capital (without liabilities from investments in noncurrent assets) of minus €41.9 million (prior year: minus €39.7 million) and changes in other assets and liabilities
not classifiable to investing or financing activities in the amount of minus €45.5 million (prior year: minus €5.3
million) show the change in the corresponding positions, adjusted for amounts attributable to investing or
financing activities.

Working capital of the Douglas-Group comprises inventories, trade accounts receivable, trade
accounts payable (including liabilities from investments in non-current assets), receivables from advertising
cost subsidies, sales promotion and supplier bonuses as well as liabilities from coupons not yet redeemed.

Cash outflow for investing activities came to €105.5 million (prior year: €106.4 million) in the reporting
period. €0.0 million were attributable to acquisitions (prior year: €3.5 million).

The sale of the former headquarter property in Hagen resulted in a cash inflow from investing activities
of €23.2 million in the prior year.

Cash outflow for financing activities amounted to €241.6 million (prior year: €113.6 million). The yearon-year increase in cash outflow is due to the first-time application of IFRS 16 in the financial year 2019/20, as
described above. This is offset by the liquidity-related utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF).

The following table shows a reconciliation of cash flows from financing liabilities to the changes in
financial liabilities reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

28. Segment reporting

_Fundamentals_

As the leading specialty retailer in Europe, the Douglas-Group operates 2,372 perfumeries (including
franchise branches) and a variety of online web shops in 26 European countries, in which primarily perfumery,
cosmetic and skincare products and food supplements are sold to end customers. Business is conducted on
the basis of an omnichannel approach that interlinks the store and online business in a way that ensures that
customers are optimally served via both channels.

_Chief Operating Decision Maker, reportable and operating segments_

The reporting segments are categorized on the basis of their organizational and decision-making
structure and the content of the internal reporting to the chief operating decision-maker.

The Board of Directors of Douglas GmbH is the chief operating decision-maker in the meaning of
IFRS 8. It steers the Douglas-Group, it is responsible for allocating resources to the business segments at the
highest level and it assesses and monitors their profitability. The Board of Directors of Douglas GmbH is also
the Board of Directors of Kirk Beauty One GmbH.

Below the chief operating decision-maker, the segment managers are responsible for the operating
business and in turn report to the chief operating decision-maker.

Based on the internal organizational and reporting structure, the segment managers are deployed at
country level, which means that steering and monitoring by the chief operating decision-maker also takes place
on country level.

The operating segments Germany and France are shown separately in the segment report (reportable
segments), as they differ considerably from the other countries (market position and market strategy,
particularly with the market presence under the Nocibé brand in France).

The current and expected gross profit margins and EBITDA margins, market position, economic
circumstances, customer base, sales organization, supplier structure and regulatory environment in the SouthWestern European countries Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Switzerland, Monaco and Andorra
on the one hand and the Eastern European countries Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia and Estonia on the other hand are mostly homogeneous. For this reason,
the individual operating segments were combined under the reportable segments South-Western Europe and
Eastern Europe. Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty were allocated to the reportable segment Germany since
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty are steered and controlled from Germany and generate the majority of their
revenues in Germany as well.

As of the reporting date, the Douglas-Group’s reportable segments were Germany, France, SouthWestern Europe and Eastern Europe.

_Segment Performance Indicator_

The segment performance indicator is Adjusted EBITDA.

Alongside sales, adjusted EBITDA is the Douglas-Group’s key financial performance indicator that is
used to assess the performance of the segments and manage resource allocation.

Internal licensing costs and other similar costs charged from the segment Germany to the segments
South-Western Europe and Eastern Europe were not included in the presentation of segment EBITDA and
adjusted segment EBITDA, in accordance with the internal steering logic.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as follows:

The EBITDA reported in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss is adjusted for those lease
expenses and income in accordance with the former IAS 17 that are to be capitalized in accordance with

F-68


-----

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

IFRS 16. The resulting “key performance indicator to be adjusted” is adjusted for those items which, in the
opinion and decision of the management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, are non-regularly recurring, exceptional
or unsuitable for internal control.

_Adjustments_

The adjustments are basically divided into the following five categories: “Credit card fees,” “Purchase
price allocations (PPA),” “Restructuring costs and severance payments,” “Consulting fees” and “Other
adjustments”. In the prior year, the adjustments made to inventory impairment losses were also reported
separately due to their materiality. In view of the abnormal situation and uniqueness of the COVID-19
pandemic, certain related expenses and income have also, in the opinion of management, to be adjusted and
have been disclosed separately in the category “COVID-19-effects”.

The respective categories are primarily attributable to the following matters:

    - Credit card fees:
Fees charged for the use of credit cards are classified as financial expenses and are reclassified to
these

    - Purchase Price Allocations (PPA):
EBITDA effects in profit or loss concerning the amortization of hidden reserves disclosed in
connection with business combinations

    - Restructuring costs and severance payments:
Expenses in connection with the sale or termination of a business unit, the closure or sale of a
group of stores, significant changes in the structure of management or fundamental
reorganizations. Within this context, expenses in the form of severance payments and salary
continuation payments without replacement of the position, furthermore in the case of
management positions at national or Group level irrespective of the replacement of the position,
are to be mentioned in particular.

    - Consulting fees:
In relation to strategic projects, acquisitions and financing

    - COVID-19-effects:
Include, in particular, personnel and rent-related vacancy costs in connection with our closed
stores and other additional costs caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

    - Other adjustments
Other matters that do not recur on a regular basis, are exceptional or are not suitable for internal
management. These include in particular: Restructuring expenses that are not personnel-related,
write-downs of receivables, impairment losses on inventories if not reported separately due to
materiality, income from the reversal of previously adjusted provisions.

    - Write-down of inventories
Income from the reversal of an impairment loss of €2.5 million recognized in the prior year.

    - COVID-19-effects:
These mainly resulted from the closure of our stores, mainly in the form of rental-related vacancy
costs of €32.5 million and personnel-related vacancy costs of €15.5 million, as well as costs of
€2.8 million for external staffing. Additional direct costs amounted to €9.7 million and mainly
included expenses for the purchase of hygiene articles such as disinfectants and masks. Cleaning
costs, additional IT costs such as extended service IT services to ensure remote work in the home
office. There were also COVID-19-related inventory valuation effects amounting to €3.7 million.
Adjustments for government grants amounting to €2.8 million had an opposite effect.

    - Other adjustments:
These include in particular expenses from the optimization of our branch structure amounting to
€9.2 million and write-downs in connection with receivables at risk of default amounting to €2.6
million. Offsetting these items are mainly compensation from our former shareholder in the amount
of €5.5 million, income from the reversal of a previously adjusted provision for legal disputes in the
amount of €1.5 million, other income in connection with legal disputes totaling €3.5 million and the
reversal of various provisions in the amount of €2.3 million (prior year mainly: Integration and
reorganization costs of €5.6 million, legal disputes of €4.8 million and, offsetting these items,
income from the sale of the former Hagen headquarters property of €10.3 million).

_Other explanations on segment reporting_

The recognized segment sales correspond to sales with external third parties. Internal sales account for
sales between individual segments. The allocation of segment sales is based on the registered office of the selling
unit. The allocation of sales to the reporting segment is based on the registered location of the selling company.

Transfers between segments are generally performed at the same prices that would apply if the
transactions were executed with third parties (arm’s length transactions).

The monthly reporting to the chief operating decision-maker only shows the inventories of individual
segments as segment assets. Inventories shown in segment reporting include purchased goods, raw materials,
consumables and supplies and advance payments for inventories.

Capital expenditure shown in segment reporting relates to additions made to intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment.

Fair values of the Notes liabilities are calculated on the basis of market prices quoted on active
markets (level 1).

A mark-to-market measurement based on yield curves available on the market is conducted for the
interest rate caps presented as derivative financial instruments under “Assets” (level 2).

The contingent purchase price liability associated with the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent of
the shares in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH was recognized as a liability to minority shareholders at its fair value of
€5.3 million as of the reporting date. The remaining 49 percent of the shares were acquired with economic
effect from January 1, 2022 and subject to the condition precedent of payment of the second purchase price
tranche. The purchase price of the 49 percent stake is also determined by the achievement of certain economic
performance indicators. The lower limit is €3.5 million, the upper limit €6.0 million. The expected value was
determined on the basis of an equal distribution of the performance indicators within a range around the
target achievement level. The expected value was discounted at an interest rate of 1.5 percent. The sensitivity
of the fair value lies between the lower limit of €3.5 million and the upper limit of €6.0 million.

In terms of trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable, fair values equal the carrying
amounts due to the short maturities involved. In case of receivables from the parent company Kirk Beauty Two
GmbH, the carrying amount is identical to the fair value as well, as the interest rate was negotiated in
accordance with standard market conditions. Since then, market interest rates have changed slightly. On the
other hand, the credit risk has increased. Since the carrying amount already takes the credit risk until maturity
into account, it substantially equals fair value still.

Fair values of liabilities to banks are based on expected cash flows within the range of contractual
agreements, discounted with a credit-risk-adjusted rate. Calculating the fair value of the syndicated bank loan,
a particularity exists. In addition to the variable EURIBOR base rate, adjustments to the credit margin are also
regularly made within legally defined boundaries. Credit margins are reassessed on a quarterly basis,
regarding the development of certain corporate key figures. The reassessment is based on ratios that the
syndicate would also include in the assessment of credit risk. As a result, interest expectations as of the

F-72

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

reporting date are largely equivalent to fair credit interest assessment. As there were no interest accruals as of
the reporting date, the fair value only deviates from the nominal value of the liability to an immaterial extent.

Fair values of other financial instruments are calculated using the present values of contractually
agreed payments in consideration of country-specific interest yield curves.

Equity participations are measured at fair value. No sale of these equity participations is planned as of
the reporting date.

30. Management of financial risks

The financial management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH is responsible for the Group’s financing and
supports decision-makers of German and foreign Group companies in respect of all financial issues.

The financial risks relevant to the Group, such as liquidity risks, the risk of interest rate changes, default
risks and risks from cash flow fluctuations, are adequately controlled and monitored by the financial
management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH.

_Liquidity risk_

With regard to liquidity risks, reference is made to the explanations provided under Note 2 in section
Assumption of going concern as the basis for accounting.

The Group generally has access to various sources for the funding of business operations, investments
and potential acquisitions. This includes existing cash and cash equivalents, net cash flow from operating
activities and bank credits as well as Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes.

All German subsidiaries and the significant subsidiaries based abroad are linked to a cash
management system (cash pooling). By combining financing volumes, short-term liquidity surpluses of
individual Group companies can be used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies. This
leads to a reduction of the debt financing volume and an optimization of cash investments, thus having a
positive impact on the Group’s net interest result.

As of the reporting date, financing agreements totaled €2,505.0 million and comprised the following.

    - €635.0 million Notes, comprising €300.0 million Senior Secured Notes and €335.0 million Senior
Notes,

    - €1,670.0 million Senior Facilities Agreement (“Term Loan B Facility”), consisting of €1,370.0 million
from “Term Loan Facility B1” and €300.0 million from “Term Loan Facility B2” and

    - €200.0 million from a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF).

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes bear fixed interest rates of 6.25 percent and 8.75
percent respectively. The interest on the “Term Loan Facility B1” of €1,370.0 million is based on EURIBOR plus a
margin of 3.5 percent. EURIBOR plus a margin of 3.25 percent has been agreed for the “Term Loan Facility B2”
in the amount of €300.0 million. The Senior Facilities Agreement contains a 0.0 percent EURIBOR floor (prior
year: 0.0 percent).

The nominal value of the Revolving Credit Facility amounted to €165.5 million at the reporting date,
consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility Loan of €74.3 million and Ancillary Facilities of €91.2 million.
Furthermore, the RCF was utilized by way of collateral in particular in the form of rental guarantees in the
amount of €17.4 million (prior year: €13.8 million).

The Revolving Credit Facility Loan bears interest at EURIBOR plus a margin of 3.75 percent. Interest on
the Ancillary Facilities is based on EURIBOR plus a line-related margin of up to 3.75 percent.

The Senior Facilities Agreement has a maturity until August 2022 and the Revolving Credit Facility until
February 2022. The Senior Secured Notes mature in July 2022 and the Unsecured Senior Notes mature in July
2023.

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The Senior Secured Notes as well the Senior Facilities Agreement are secured by collateral. The
following assets were pledged as collateral: bank balances, shares in certain Group companies and internal
accounts receivable as well as assets from interest cap agreements.

In the event of borrower default, the lenders have the opportunity to initiate a contractually defined
process, which aims to bring about the immediate due payment of the liability and the utilization of the
pledged collateral.

Carrying amounts include accruals.

Individual companies also have access to bilateral credit lines, none of which (prior year: €0.0 million)
had been utilized as of the reporting date. In addition, government loans totaling €2.0 million were drawn
down from national aid programs.

Kirk Beauty One GmbH and its subsidiaries have to meet certain other obligations and key financial
covenants, if 40.0 percent of the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn in the form of Revolving Credit Facility
Loans. The Revolving Credit Facility Loan was valued at €74.3 million as of the reporting date, which
corresponds to a utilization of less than 40 percent of the RCF.

The utilization of the RCF through Ancillary Facilities in the amount of €91.2 million (prior year: €0.0
million) and collateral in the form of rental guarantees in the amount of €17.4 million (prior year: €13.8 million)
is of no significance for the calculation of and compliance with financial covenants. Accordingly, compliance
with these financial covenants agreed in the loan agreement is not relevant as of September 30, 2020.

Besides these financial covenants, the Group also has to meet certain qualitative covenants.

If the obligations are not met, the lenders are entitled to cancel the loan agreements with immediate
effect and call upon all pledged collateral.

Considering the high debt ratio, there is a concentration of risk as of the reporting date regarding the
types of debt financing described, which is monitored with particular care by management. A complete
repayment from the generated funds is only possible over a very long period of time. It is expected that a
(partial) redemption could take place as part of a sale or IPO. Alternatively, refinancing could take place until
the year 2022. The interest rate to be expected by then depends on the interest rate environment to be
observed as well as leverage and rating.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

All financial liabilities existing as of the reporting date and for which payments were already
contractually agreed are included in the table. Payments for future liabilities which did not exist as of the
reporting date are not included. Floating interest rate payments were determined on the basis of the interest
rates known as of the reporting date. Financial liabilities cancellable at all times are always classified to the
earliest time slot. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euros using the closing rate.

_Interest rate risk_

The interest rate risk is the result of fluctuations in interest rates on the capital markets. The loans
attributable to the Group from the Senior Facilities Agreement generally bear variable interest based on the
EURIBOR. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement of €1,670 million contains an interest rate floor, which is
effective at 0.0 percent. To reduce the risk of cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates of variable
loans, the Group entered into interest rate hedging agreements.

Interest rate caps are in place to hedge against the risk of interest rate fluctuations over a total nominal
volume of €1,100.0 million. These caps reduce the risk of an increase in EURIBOR to a maximum of 1.0 percent.
The resulting cash flows can affect the interest result during the period from October 1, 2015 through
September 30, 2021. The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an interest rate floor at 0.0 percent EURIBOR.
The cash flows from this agreement will affect the interest result until August 13, 2022.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the interest rate risk. Subject to this analysis was the
Senior Facilities Agreement, which bears interest rate risks based on the EURIBOR as far as it is not part of a
hedging relationship. A relative increase in the interest rate by 100 base points would affect interest expenses
in the amount of roughly €9.5 million.

_Currency risk_

Operating units of the Kirk Beauty One Group largely conduct their activities in the respective
functional currency. The currency risk of the Group is considered to be low, as 90 percent of the Group’s sales
(prior year: 91 percent) were effected in euros in the financial year 2019/20 and merchandise was purchased
almost exclusively in euros. Differences arising from the translation of foreign currencies to the parent’s
currency for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements do not impact currency risk.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted in line with the requirements of IFRS 7. This analysis includes the
effects from foreign currency positions measured at the closing date rate pursuant to IAS 21 through profit or
loss.

The effects recognized in profit or loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on financial
instruments denominated in foreign currency but not designated as hedged items as part of foreign currency
hedging transactions have been included in the sensitivity analysis. This means that Kirk Beauty One Group
would be exposed to risks of €0.3 million in the event of an improvement or deterioration in the value of the
Euro exchange rate of 5 percent.

_Default risk_

Default risk is the risk of financial losses if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The default risk generally arises from all financial assets in the portfolio, such
as trade accounts receivable, other receivables, cash investments with bank partners and derivatives with a
positive market value. The carrying amounts of the financial assets and contract assets correspond to the
maximum default risk.

Arising from the increased focus of the e-commerce channel, the entities of the Kirk Beauty One
Group are faced with a receivables default risk, which is a system-inherent risk in mail-order retail. For this
reason, the companies operate an effective and constantly optimized debtor management system including
consistent dunning procedures.

F-76

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

A default risk may arise from the default of a banking partner, in particular as a result of insolvency in
the context of financial investments or positive market values from derivatives. The Kirk Beauty One Group
counters this risk by concluding transactions concerning both financial investments and financial instruments
exclusively with first-class banks. At the same time, the volume is distributed among several counterparties in
order to avoid concentration risks. Due to the difficult global economic situation, larger financial investments
are avoided as far as possible or only concluded with first-class German banks.

_Capital management_

The subject of capital management is equity under IFRS. The goal of the Kirk Beauty One Group’s
capital management is to assure that the Group can continue to meet its financial obligations and that the
covenants from the syndicated loans are met. A further goal of capital management is to increase the
enterprise value on a long-term basis. A secondary aim of the capital management strategy is to ensure that all
Group companies have appropriate equity according to local needs, such that external capital requirements
were always met in the past financial year. This is to be achieved through the constant improvement of cash
flow and EBITDA.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019

The fees for the auditor of the Consolidated Financial Statements, KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, in accordance with Section 285 (17) German Commercial Code (HGB) came
to €3.0 million in total (prior year: €1.3 million) for the financial year 2019/20; thereof €0.8 million for the audit
of financial statements (prior year: €0.8 million) and €2.2 million for other services (prior year: €0.5 million).

_Management_

The Group’s business is managed by Tina Müller (Chief Executive Officer, CEO), Matthias Born (Chief
Financial Officer, CFO), Vanessa Stützle (Chief Digital Officer, CDO, from May 12, 2020) and Dr. Michael F.
Keppel (Chief Restructuring Officer, CRO, from October 28, 2020).

_Events after the reporting date_

The following events requiring consideration occurred between the Consolidated Financial
Statements reporting date and the date on which the Consolidated Financial Statements were approved for
publication:

_The coronavirus pandemic—impact on financial year 2020/21_

Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been overcome. In the first quarter of financial year
2020/21, and thus in the important Christmas business, there were lockdowns with store closures across
Europe once again. Many of our stores continued to be closed in January. A large part of the decline in store
sales was offset by the strong e-commerce business.

_Changed customer behavior—optimization of our store network_

The longstanding trend of shifting from store to e-commerce purchases was further reinforced by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this change in our customers’ consumer behavior, around 500 of the
currently around 2,400 stores across Europe will be closed. Most of the closings take place in the SouthWestern Europe region, which is particularly affected by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and in which
there is a very dense, partially overlapping branch network due to previous acquisitions. The necessary
downsizing of the branch network goes hand in hand with investments in flagship stores in top locations,
product innovations and the consistent expansion of digital retail throughout Europe. As a result of the abovementioned measures, we currently expect one-time expenses in the high double-digit million range and
sustainable positive effects in the low triple-digit million range.

_Additional incremental revolving facility of €75 million_

At the end of January, Douglas received additional commitments from the banks for an incremental
revolving facility in the amount of €75 million.

_Day of preparation and authorization for issue_

Management prepared and authorized for issue the Consolidated Financial Statements on January 28,
2021.

Independent Auditor’s Report

To Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf

_Opinions_

We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at September 30,
2020, the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, the Consolidated Reconciliation from Profit or Loss to Total
Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Changes in Group Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the financial year from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, and the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the
Group Management Report of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the financial year from October 1, 2019 to
September 30, 2020.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

— the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements comply, in all material respects, with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at September 30, 2020, and the profit or loss for the financial
year from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, and

— the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group’s position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the
Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements and presents the
opportunities and risks of future development appropriately.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any objections
relating to the legal compliance of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report.

_Basis for the Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management
Report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the German Generally Accepted Standards of Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany]
(IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the section
“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report” of our auditor’s report. We are independent from the group entities in accordance with
the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and on the Group Management Report.

_Material uncertainty in connection with the going concern assumption_

We refer to the disclosures “Assumption of going concern as the basis of accounting” in section 2
“Accounting standards” and “Events after the reporting date” in section 33 “Other explanatory notes” of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the disclosures in section “Financial risks” of the
Group Management Report, in which the legal representatives describe the following material uncertainty in
connection with the going concern.

The financial risks represent a going concern risk for the Douglas-Group. The following material
uncertainties exist:

— the follow-up financing until maturity in 2022 and 2023 must succeed,

F-83


-----

— the required and planned increase in earnings power in the Group’s transformation process
must be achieved and thus solvency maintained, and

— the liquidity of the Group must not be additionally burdened by further delays in opening the
stores.

The long-term financing of the Douglas-Group is provided by a senior syndicated loan agreement
including a Revolving Credit Facility and Ancillary Facilities as well as corporate bonds issued. The risk of a lack
of follow-up financing until maturity in 2022 or 2023 is assessed as high. In total, the senior syndicated loan
agreement including the Revolving Credit Facility and the corporate bonds issued provide the Douglas-Group
with financial resources in the amount of €2,505.0 million. With the drawing of the Revolving Credit Facility and
the Ancillary Facilities in the amount of €165.5 million in March 2020, the credit lines are almost exhausted.
According to current planning, the Douglas-Group will not be in a position to repay these liabilities from its
own funds when the non-current financial liabilities mature, so that refinancing will have to be successful.

During the term of the financing agreements, the Douglas-Group must, among other obligations, in
particular service the cost of capital on time and maintain a certain ratio between adjusted EBITDA and debt
(financial covenant). However, the obligation to comply with the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to debt only arises
when at least 40.0 percent or €80 million (threshold) of the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn down by
Revolving Credit Facility Loans.

The ongoing servicing of the cost of capital generally assumes that the Douglas-Group’s planning will
not be significantly missed in terms of sales, earnings and cash flow development.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on the Douglas-Group’s
business. The original planning for sales and earnings for the financial year 2019/20 from October 2019 was
significantly missed.

It is now clear that COVID-19 will also impact the Group’s further development in financial year
2020/21. At present, a reduction in financing reserves is assumed for the Douglas-Group, taking into account
the current store closures and restrictions in some countries and the assumed openings from February. Each
additional week of store closures further increases the liquidity risk.

The massive shift in business to digital retail and the compensation for the associated decline in store
business, as well as the adjustment of the store network, are thus seen as a necessary step to increase earnings
power.

According to the liquidity planning there are only limited liquidity reserves beyond the reporting date
of September 30, 2021, in order to maintain solvency at all times even in the event of further plan failures or an
extended period of store closures.

These events and circumstances indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast
significant doubt about the Kirk Beauty One Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and that represents
a going concern risk within the meaning of Section 322 (2) sentence 3 HGB. Our audit opinion is not modified
with respect to this matter.

_Other Information_

Management is responsible for the other information.

The other information comprises the information in the Financial Report, which is published in English
language, with the exception of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Group Management
Report and our auditor’s report.

Our opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, we have a responsibility to read the other information referred to above,
when it becomes available, and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information

— is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the content of the audited
Group Management Report disclosures or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

— otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management_
_Report_

Management is responsible for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that comply,
in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the Consolidated Financial Statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and
profit or loss of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal controls as they have
determined necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the
accounting principle of “going concern” unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that,
as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position, is, in all material respects, consistent with the
Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements, and presents the opportunities
and risks of future development appropriately. In addition, management is responsible for such precautions
and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Group Management
Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide
sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the Group Management Report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group_
_Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial
Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the
group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and presents the opportunities and risks of future development
appropriately, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and on the Group Management Report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with the German Generally Accepted Standards of
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these Consolidated Financial Statements and this Group Management Report.

We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We
also:

— identify and assess the risks of material misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements
and in the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls.

— obtain an understanding of internal control system relevant to the audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and of precautions and measures relevant to the audit of the Group
Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these
systems.

— evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the
reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.

— conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the accounting principle of “going
concern” and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists

F-85


-----

related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Group Management Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

— evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements
present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and the profit or
loss of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.

— obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and on the Group Management Report. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our
opinions.

— evaluate the consistency of the Group Management Report with the Consolidated Financial
Statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

— perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the
Group Management Report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate,
in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and
underlaying assumptions. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We discuss with those charged with governance, among other matters, the planned scope and the
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control system
that we identify during our audit.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

1. General principles

Kirk Beauty One GmbH (Group parent company) is a limited liability company registered at LuiseRainer-Str. 7-11, 40235 Düsseldorf, Germany and is registered in commercial register B of the district court of
Düsseldorf under the registration number 79429. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One
GmbH and its subsidiaries (Kirk Beauty One Group, Douglas-Group, Group) as of September 30, 2019 (balance
sheet date) comprise the reporting period beginning October 1, 2018 until September 30, 2019 (financial year,
reporting period) and were prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The
Consolidated Financial Statements take into account all compulsory accounting standards and interpretations
in the European Union adopted at that time.

This version of the Consolidated Financial Statements is in accordance with the provisions of
Section 315e HGB (German Commercial Code). This forms the legal basis for accounting processes in
Germany in accordance with international standards, together with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002 on the application of international accounting
standards.

The financial statements of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements were prepared uniformly according to the applicable IFRS classification, accounting and
measurement principles.

During financial years 2017/18 and 2018/19 the following acquisitions[1] were made; their initial
inclusion limits the comparability of figures.

     - Perfumerías IF Group, Spain (IF)

In November 2017, 103 Perfumerías IF stores (thereof 5 retail stores in Andorra) were acquired
and included for the first time as of November 1, 2017.

     - LLG Group, Italy (LLG)

The Douglas-Group acquired Limoni S.p.A., Milan/Italy, and La Gardenia Beauty S.p.A., Grosseto/
Italy in mid-November 2017. They were first included in the Kirk Beauty One Group as of
November 1, 2017.

     - Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH, Germany (Parfumdreams)

By mid-August 2018, the Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH was acquired and included for the first time
as of September 1, 2018.

     - Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH, Germany (Niche Beauty)

Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH was acquired in mid-July 2019 and included in the Kirk Beauty One
Group for the first time as of August 1, 2019.

These Consolidated Financial Statements are generally based on the principle of historical cost. The
main exceptions to this are financial instruments recognized at fair value.

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in euros (EUR/€). All amounts are presented in
million euros (EUR m), unless otherwise indicated. The Consolidated Financial Statements are approved for
publication as of December 12, 2019.

The Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss was generally prepared according to the nature of
expense method. By modification of the reporting structure defined in IAS 1.102, the cost of raw materials,
consumables and supplies and merchandise is reported directly after sales in order to determine “Gross profit
from retail business”, which is significant for retail operations.

1 Further details of the inclusion of these acquisitions can be found in Note 3, Consolidation Principles.

Each standard may be adopted for the first time at the point at which adoption will be compulsory for
the company.

The new IFRS 16 standard will replace the current IAS 17 (Leases) and IFRIC 4 (Determining Whether
an Arrangement Contains a Lease). The scope of IFRS 16 generally covers the accounting for leases. A lease is
defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset for a period in exchange for
consideration.

The main new feature of IFRS 16 compared to IAS 17 concerns accounting principles for the lessee.
The classification into operating leases and financial leases will no longer apply in the future. The lessee
recognizes a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset for the leasing object upon the
commencement of the asset lease. The lessee recognizes the liability at the present value of the future lease
payments.

In the Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, the initial accounting of rights- ofuse, mostly from store leases, as right-of-use assets and correspondingly as financial liabilities will lead to a
significant rise in intangible assets and a corresponding increase in liabilities in the amount of €1.500 million up
to €1.900 million (balance sheet extension). The subsequent measurement required by IFRS 16 will reduce
lease expenses and result in improved EBITDA. Depreciation and amortization, as well as interest expenses, are
likely to rise. At present, the impact cannot be measured reliably.

The date of first-time adoption for the Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH is
October 1, 2019. The modified retrospective method was chosen for first-time adoption.

_First-time adoption of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)_

The new IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 (Revenue) and IAS 11 (Construction Contracts) as well as associated
interpretations and lays out a standardized and comprehensive model for recognizing revenue generated with
customers. IFRS 15 also covers several issues such as how to treat rights of return, transactions on a commission
basis, customer retention and customer loyalty programs. In addition, the required disclosures in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements have been expanded considerably. IFRS 15 is effective for periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Kirk Beauty One GmbH therefore applied this standard for the first time
on October 1, 2018.

A basic impact of IFRS 15 concerns options regularly granted as part of customer loyalty programs, to
acquire additional goods or services at a discounted price in the future. With the initial sale, part of the
transaction price must be allocated to the resulting option. Sales will be accrued as contract liability under
other financial liabilities. Revenue recognition for the option occurs at the time the right is redeemed or
expired.

The Douglas-Group has opted for retrospective application of IFRS 15 with recognition of the
cumulative effects at the date of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings. For reasons of materiality, the opening balance sheet value was not adjusted.

The first-time adoption of IFRS 15 did not result in any significant change in the timing of revenue
recognition or in the allocation of the transaction price between the individual performance obligations for Kirk
Beauty One GmbH.

_First-time adoption of IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments)_

As of October 1, 2018, the Group adopted IFRS 9 for the first time. IFRS 9 specifies the requirements
for the recognition and measurement of financial assets, financial liabilities and certain contracts for the

F-97


-----

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

purchase or sale of non-financial contracts. This standard replaces IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement).

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group has implemented consequential amendments to IAS 1
(Presentation of Financial Statements), which require an impairment loss on financial assets in accordance with
the expected credit loss model to be presented in a separate line item in the Consolidated Statement of Profit
or Loss. This does not include impairment losses on receivables from Kirk Beauty Two GmbH (shareholder of
the Group parent company), which are reported in financial result. Impairments of other financial assets are not
reported separately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for reasons of materiality, but in financial
result, similar to the former presentation in accordance with IAS 39.

In addition, the Group has applied consequential amendments to IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments:
Disclosures) to the Notes for the financial year 2018/19. These were not applied to the comparative
information.

_Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities_

IFRS 9 contains three basic categories for the classification of financial assets: measured at amortized
cost, measured at fair through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and measured at fair value through profit
or loss (FVTPL). Financial assets are classified in accordance with IFRS 9 based on the company’s business
model for managing financial assets and the characteristics of contractual cash flows. IFRS 9 eliminates the
previous categories of IAS 39: held-to-maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale. Under IFRS 9,
derivatives embedded in contracts, where the basis is a financial asset within the scope of the standard, are
never accounted for separately. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification.

IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements of IAS 39 for the classification of financial liabilities.

The first-time adoption of IFRS 9 had no material impact on the Group’s accounting policies with
respect to financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments.

For an explanation on how the Group classifies and measures financial instruments and related gains
and losses in accordance with IFRS 9, see Note 9, Financial result.

The effects from the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 on the carrying amounts of financial assets as of
October 1, 2018 solely result from the new regulations on the recognition of impairment losses.

Equity participations are investments that the Group intends to hold over the long term for strategic
reasons. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group designated these investments as “measured at fair value through
profit or loss” on the transition date, as they were managed on the basis of fair values and their performance is
monitored on this basis.

Trade accounts receivable and other receivables classified as “loans and receivables” in accordance
with IAS 39 are now classified as “measured at amortized cost”. An increase of €75.5. million in the allowance
for these receivables was recognized in retained earnings as of October 1, 2018 with the transition to IFRS 9.

As a result of a revaluation, the carrying amount of trade accounts receivable decreased by
€0.2 million from €47.2 million to €47.0 million and the carrying amount of receivables against shareholders by
€75.2 million from €578.4 million to €503.2 million at the IFRS 9 transition date on October 1, 2018.

_Impairment of financial assets_

IFRS 9 replaces the “incurred losses” model of IAS 39 with an “expected credit loss” (“ECL”) model.
The new impairment model applies to financial assets classified as “measured at amortized cost”, contractual

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

assets and debt instruments classified as “measured at fair value through other comprehensive income”, but
not to equity investments held as financial assets. Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognized earlier than under
IAS 39 - see Note 14, Trade accounts receivable.

As of October 1, 2018 additional impairment losses result from the application of the impairment
requirements of IFRS 9. Of these losses, €0.2 million relate to trade accounts receivable and €75.2 million to
long-term loan receivables. After deferred taxes, a total effect of €51.3 million was recorded in other reserves in
equity.

_Transition_

Regarding the changes in accounting policies resulting from the first-time application of IFRS 9:

In exercising its exemption option, the Group has not restated comparative information for the prior
period. Differences between the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the
application of IFRS 9 are generally recognized in retained earnings and other reserves as of October 1, 2018.
To this extent, the information presented for 2017/18 does not comply with the requirements of IFRS 9, but
with those of IAS 39.

The determination of the business model under which a financial asset is held is based on the facts
and circumstances that existed at the date of first-time adoption.

3. Consolidation principles

_Group of consolidated companies_

All the German and foreign companies over which Kirk Beauty One GmbH has direct or indirect
control are fully consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Control exists when Kirk Beauty One
GmbH obtains power over an investee, when Kirk Beauty One is exposed to variable returns from its
investments with the investee and when it is able to influence these returns. These companies are fully
consolidated when the Group obtains control and deconsolidated when control ceases.

Two companies in which the Group does not hold a majority stake, but on which the Group does have
a significant influence, were not recognized using the at-equity method. These companies solely provide
intercompany services for the Douglas-Group and are of minor importance to the net assets, financial position
and results of operations of the Group due to their extremely low business volumes. In addition, some of these
companies have different balance sheet dates and do not prepare interim financial statements. Because of this,
no financial information regarding these companies is available as of the balance sheet date and the fair values
cannot be reliably determined. The carrying amount of these investments recognized under financial assets
amounts to €38 thousand in total.

_Acquisitions_

_“Niche Beauty“ acquisition_

On July 16, 2019 Douglas acquired a 51 percent majority interest in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH,
Hamburg, an up-and-coming online portal exclusively for exceptional international premium cosmetics brands,
with the aim of further expanding Douglas’ position in the attractive luxury segment. The online shop is
operated under the domain “www.niche-beauty.com”. The financial year under review of Niche-Beauty.COM
GmbH ends on December 31, 2019. The purchase price for the 51 percent stake amounted to €3.5 million. The
remaining 49 percent of the shares were acquired with economic effect from January 1, 2022 and subject to

F-100

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

the condition precedent of payment of the second purchase price tranche. This leads to the application of the
anticipated acquisition method and thus to a 100 percent recognition of the shares. The purchase price of the
49 percent stake is also determined by the achievement of certain economic performance indicators (sales and
EBITDA). The lower limit is €3.5 million, the upper limit €6.0 million. The purchase price liability for the second
tranche was recognized at its discounted expected value of €5.2 million. The expected value was determined
on the basis of an equal distribution of the performance indicators within a range around the target
achievement level. In addition, a call put option agreement was concluded. This was not taken into account
when determining the fair value for the second purchase price tranche, as exercising the options was not
considered economically viable. The call option can be exercised at any time before January 1, 2022. The call
option price depends on the exercise date and the performance indicators achieved up to this date. The put
option is generally subject to the same conditions; for the period after the exercise date, a discount to the
minimum amount must also be taken into account.

The purchase price allocation was provisional. The final purchase price allocation will be completed a
maximum of one year after the acquisition date (July 16, 2020). As part of the preliminary purchase price
allocation, the “Niche Beauty” brand was recognized at €0.9 million. The valuation was conducted according to
the income approach using the relief from royalty method. The customer relationships associated with the
customer data of the online shop were identified as an asset and recognized at €1.1 million. The valuation of
customer relationships was conducted according to the capital market approach using the residual value
method. The disclosure of hidden reserves increased inventories by €0.2 million. They were measured at fair
value, based on the selling prices less the necessary selling costs and less an appropriate profit margin for the
acquirer. The disclosure of hidden reserves resulted in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in the amount
of €0.7 million. Deferred tax assets of €0.1 million were recognized on tax loss carryforwards.

The consideration in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The goodwill reflects the expected synergies, which mainly
result from a strengthened market position and the Niche Beauty web shop. Goodwill was allocated to the
operating segment Germany. During the time of affiliation to the Group, Niche Beauty generated sales of
€1.2 million and earnings before taxes (EBT) of minus €0.1 million. If Niche Beauty had already been included in
the Consolidated Financial Statements since the beginning of the financial year on October 1, 2018, sales
would have been higher by around €7.4 million and earnings before taxes lower by around €0.3 million. The
receivables correspond to their nominal value, which will also be settled.

_„Parfumdreams“ acquisition_

The purchase price allocation was completed without changes to previous year’s financial statements.

_Consolidation methods_

Capital consolidation is conducted by offsetting acquisition costs against the Group’s interest in the
consolidated subsidiary’s net assets at fair value on the acquisition date. Any positive differences are
capitalized as goodwill and tested annually for impairment. Any negative differences are recognized in profit or
loss. Any identifiable net assets including hidden reserves and liabilities due to minority shareholders are
carried as non-controlling interests.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

Receivables from and corresponding payables to consolidated companies are eliminated against each
other. Interim profits from delivery of goods and rendering of services within the Group are eliminated in the
Consolidated Financial Statements to the extent that these do not relate to sales realized with third parties.
Sales and other income from intercompany delivery of goods and rendering of services are offset against
corresponding expenses.

4. Currency translation

These Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros (Group currency), the functional
currency of the Group parent company. The annual financial statements of foreign subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the same as the Group currency are translated into euros according to the functional
currency concept. The functional currency of the subsidiaries is the currency of the main economic area in
which the subsidiary operates. This is generally the respective national currency.

The assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; income
and expenses are converted at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation
differences are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income and within reserves in equity.

The following exchange rates were used for currency translation for the annual financial statements of
foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies.

Foreign currency transactions are recognized in the functional currency as translated at the applicable
exchange rate at the time of the transaction. Assets and liabilities nominally denominated in such foreign
currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. All differences resulting from
currency translation are recognized in profit or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Income
resulting from exchange rate differences totaled €0.6 million (prior year: €0.6 million). Expenses from exchange
rate differences totaled €1.3 million (prior year: €1.0 million).

5. Accounting and valuation principles

_Intangible assets_

Goodwill arising from capital consolidation, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, is recognized according to the requirements of IFRS 3 and tested
for impairment annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the group of cash-generating units
(CGU) that is expected to profit from synergies arising from the acquisition. A cash-generating unit (CGU) is
defined as an individual retail store or an online shop. The ceiling for goodwill allocation is generally
determined by the operating segment and hence the respective stand-alone country in which Douglas
operates.

If, as part of this impairment test, the company determines that the recoverable amount of the group
of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, associated goodwill is written down and recognized in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed even if the reasons for the impairment cease to exist
in subsequent periods.

F-102

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

Other intangible assets are carried at (amortized) cost. There are no qualifying assets within the
meaning of IAS 23 within the Douglas-Group, so that borrowing costs are not included when calculating
acquisition costs. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are subject to straight-line amortization over their
useful lives and are depreciated on a “pro rata temporis”-basis in the year of purchase.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. These assets are reviewed for
impairment at least once a year if there are indications of impairment. If the recoverable amount is below the
carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are the trademarks Douglas and Nocibé and leasehold
rights in France.

Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are only subject to an impairment test if there are
triggering events indicating impairment.

Reviews must be carried out in subsequent years to see if indications of impairment exist to suggest
that an impairment made in the prior years no longer exists or has been reduced. If this is the case, the
impairment is reversed up to the recoverable amount, but to a maximum of the amortized carrying amount.

_Property, plant and equipment_

Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at (amortized) cost. There are no qualifying assets
within the meaning of IAS 23 within the Douglas-Group, so that borrowing costs are not included when
calculating acquisition costs. Items of property, plant and equipment are subject to straight-line depreciation
over their (expected) useful lives and are depreciated on a “pro rata temporis”-basis in the year of purchase.

Restoration obligations for leasehold improvements arise from the contracts for leased premises,
whose discounted values are recognized as provisions. The discounted value of the obligation is part of the
leasehold improvement acquisition costs and depreciated over the expected useful life.

An impairment test is conducted for the corresponding asset if indications of impairment exist.
Tangible assets are derecognized when removed or further economic benefits are no longer expected from
that asset’s use. The gain or loss from the disposal of the asset arises from the difference between its net
realizable value and carrying amount.

The useful lives underpinning the straight-line amortization and depreciation for intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment are determined on the basis of the estimated useful lives for each asset class
and are as follows.

_Leases_

Leases are accounted for in line with the requirements of IAS 17.

The economic ownership of a leased asset is allocated to that contractual party which bears the main
risks and rewards incident to ownership of the leased asset. Material lease arrangements relate to the leasing of
retail stores. In order to ensure the greatest possible flexibility, the Group fundamentally concludes rental
agreements with a base rental period of no more than ten years and single or multiple exercisable options to
extend the lease. In classifying lease agreements, consideration is given to the base lease term and the
exercise of one renewal option based on experience on the condition that the Group lessee company
possesses this option and it is likely that it will be exercised. These leasing agreements qualify as operating
leases, as the base lease term plus one renewal option does not exceed the significant part of the economic
useful life of the rented premises.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

_Financial assets_

Except for current trade accounts receivable and derivatives, all financial instruments are recognized
on the settlement date. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the date on which they arise. Derivatives
that are allocated to the “measured at fair value through profit or loss” category are recognized on the trade
date.

All financial instruments must be measured at fair value upon initial recognition. If financial instruments
are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue are recognized additionally. Current trade accounts receivable are initially measured at the
transaction price.

Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if they are held within a business model solely for the
purpose of collecting the contractual cash flows (business model “hold”) and the contractual terms only result
in interest and principal payments on the outstanding principal amount at specified points in time.

Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held as
part of a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets (business model
“hold and sell”) and the contractual terms only result in interest and principal payments on the outstanding
principal amount at specified points in time.

On initial recognition of an equity investment (e.g. an equity participation) that is not held for trading
purposes, the Group may irrevocably elect to recognize consequential changes in fair value through other
comprehensive income. This choice is made on a case-by-case basis for each investment.

All financial assets that are not measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets are derecognized either upon settlement or when all main opportunities and risks are
transferred.

Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency at the date
of acquisition. An adjustment to the respective closing rate is made on each balance sheet date and
recognized in profit or loss. Interest income and expense relating to financial assets are matched to the period
in the financial result.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligations have been fulfilled, cancelled or
expired. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual terms are modified and the cash
flows of the modified liability are significantly different.

_Fair value measurement_

The input factors used to determine fair value are divided into three hierarchy levels (Level 1, Level 2
and Level 3). Fair value is the price at which an asset would be sold or a liability transferred in an orderly
transaction on the principal market or, if none exists, in the most advantageous market to which the Group has
access on the measurement date. The fair value of a liability reflects the risk of non-performance. Fair value
measurements based on Level 1 input factors are price quotations in active markets that can be determined for
the asset being measured, such as quoted prices. Fair value measurements based on factors whose
measurement can be derived directly or indirectly from observable market data fall under Level 2. The
valuation technique used incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in determining the
price of such a transaction. The valuation on Level 3 is based on pricing models which are based on input
factors that are not observable in the market.

Kirk Beauty One Group only measures interest rate caps and options held by non-controlling interests
at fair value.[4] The fair value measurement of interest rate caps falls under the second hierarchy level (level 2), as
the valuation is based on observable market interest rates.

4 4 Cf. No. 26, Fair value of financial instruments

F-104

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

Kirk Beauty One Group measures liabilities from contingent purchase price payments at fair value.[5]
The input factors on which the valuation is based are assigned to level 2 or level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

_Amortized cost_

Amortized cost is determined on acquisition using the effective interest method, less any impairment,
and taking into account discounts and premiums, including directly attributable transaction costs and fees that
form an integral part of the effective interest rate.

For current assets and liabilities, the carrying amount is regarded as an appropriate approximation of
fair value due to the short period between their recognition and maturity.

_Derivative financial instruments_

Kirk Beauty One GmbH uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate derivatives, to
hedge against currency and interest rate risks. In accordance with IFRS 9, these financial instruments are
recognized at fair value at the time the contract is concluded and measured at fair value in subsequent periods.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is recognized as an asset if it is positive and as a liability if it is
negative.

Derivative financial instruments are held exclusively for hedging purposes and carried at fair value.
Gains or losses from changes in fair value are recognized immediately in financial income or expenses. Kirk
Beauty One GmbH does not apply the special regulations for hedge accounting.

In addition to derivative financial instruments, derivatives embedded in financial liabilities are also
separated if they are derivatives in themselves, if the hybrid financial instrument is not measured at fair value
through profit or loss and if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely
related to the economic characteristics and risks of the financial liability.

For derivative financial instruments, the fair value corresponds to the amount that the Group company
would either receive or have to pay upon termination of the financial instrument on the balance sheet date. The
fair value is determined taking into account the interest rates and forward rates applicable on the balance sheet
date.

_Subsequent measurement and gains and losses_

Net gains and losses, including interest and dividend income from financial instruments measured at
fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in profit or loss.

Financial instruments measured at amortized cost are measured using the effective interest method.
Amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, exchange rate differences and impairments
are recognized in profit or loss. Gains or losses from derecognition are also recognized in profit or loss.

_Impairment of financial assets_

The Group recognizes valuation allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets that are not
measured at fair value through profit or loss. For these financial assets – with exception of trade accounts
receivable, which are subject to a simplified approach – the expected credit loss within the following twelve
months is determined upon initial recognition in level 1 of the “expected credit loss model”. If there is a
significant increase in credit risk, it is transferred to level 2 of the model. For these financial instruments and for
trade accounts receivable, life-long credit losses are determined on level 2 of the general model. If there is
objective evidence of impairment, the financial assets are assigned to level 3 of the model. The expected credit
losses are determined on an individual item basis depending on various factors, e.g. past due, counterparties
and country risks.

Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to the general model of expected
credit losses. As the counterparties are exclusively counterparties with at least an investment grade rating
(BBB+ or higher), a low credit risk is assumed for these financial instruments.

5 5 Cf. No. 26, Fair value of financial instruments

F-105


-----

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

If the requirements for a low credit risk are not met, an assessment of the change in credit risk is
required. In determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and in estimating expected credit losses, Kirk Beauty One GmbH takes into account appropriate
information that is relevant and available without undue expense of time and money. For other financial assets
carried at amortized cost, the credit risk is continuously monitored on the basis of bond quotes and ratings if
these are available in liquid form. Furthermore, a significantly increased credit risk is assumed when a financial
asset is more than 30 days overdue.

There is objective evidence of impairment if Kirk Beauty One GmbH anticipates adverse effects on
expected cash flows. These include, for example, significant financial difficulties on the part of the issuer or
debtor, indications of insolvency or other restructuring proceedings as well as deterioration in market
conditions. In this sense, financial assets are deemed to have defaulted if they are more than 90 days overdue.
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written down if a reasonable estimate is that the financial asset
will not be recoverable in full or in part.

Expected credit losses over the lifetime of the financial instrument are expected credit losses resulting
from all possible default events during the expected lifetime of the financial instrument.

12-months credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses resulting from default events that are
possible within twelve months of the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected maturity is less than
twelve months).

Expenses or income from impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses for expected credit
losses on financial assets are reported under the line item “Result from impairments on financial assets” in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. Impairment losses for financial assets in the general approach are
insignificant.

_Trade accounts receivable and other receivables_

Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the transaction price and other receivables are
recognized at fair value at the time of revenue recognition. Allowances are made for impaired receivables. All
discernible risks and value-reducing factors are taken into account on the basis of an analysis as of the balance
sheet date. Doubtful but not uncollectible receivables are carried at their probable recoverable amount at the
balance sheet date. Irrecoverable receivables are written off in full.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents, which include money accounts and short-term money deposits with banks,
are measured at amortized cost, based on the business model „hold“ and the fulfilment of the cash flow
criterion, and have residual terms of a maximum of three months at the point of acquisition.

_Income taxes_

Tax expenses comprise both current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in
profit or loss, except for those associated with a business combination or items recognized directly in equity or
in other comprehensive income.

_Current taxes_

Current taxes constitute anticipated tax liabilities or assets on the taxable income or loss generated in
the reporting period, calculated on the basis of tax rates applying on the balance sheet date or shortly
afterwards, as well as adjustments to tax liabilities or assets in previous periods. The amount of the anticipated
tax liabilities or assets represents a best estimate in consideration of uncertain tax situations, if applicable.
Current tax liabilities also include all tax liabilities resulting from the declaration of dividends.

_Deferred taxes_

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax base to the extent that these differences will lead to tax refunds
or charges in future. Deferred taxes are measured taking into account the tax rates and tax regulations which
are expected to be in force when the differences are reversed. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the
extent that there is taxable income expected on the date on which the difference is reversed.

F-106


-----

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

If the future tax advantage from loss carryforwards can be utilized with sufficient certainty in future
periods, deferred tax assets are recognized. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities if such
liabilities exist against the same tax authority.

_Inventories_

Merchandise is recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Acquisition costs are
identified either by using the average cost method or, in some minor countries, by using the retail method
based on the selling price using reasonable valuation allowance deductions. Interest on borrowings is not
included in the acquisition costs, as inventories, most of which constitute acquired trading merchandise, are
not qualifying assets as defined by IAS 23. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated costs necessary to sell the inventory. Ageing as well as fashion and other
risks were considered, to the extent needed, as part of measurement at the net realizable value. Raw materials,
consumables and supplies are recognized at their acquisition costs.

_Provisions_

Provisions are recognized if there is a legal or constructive obligation to third parties arising from past
events and if the future cash outflow to fulfill this commitment can be estimated reliably. The carrying amount
of the provision is based—for individual risks—on the best estimate of the settlement considering all
recognizable risks, or—for a large population of risks—the amount computed according to the expected value
method. Non-current provisions are recognized at their present value as of the balance sheet date. The
maturity of long-term human resources commitments is based on the date the employee leaves the company
or on the timing of forecasted cash outflows. The maturity of long-term real estate commitments is based on
the term of the lease contract or the estimated date of an early termination of the lease contract. Provisions for
restoration obligations are recognized if contractual agreements and experience show that there is a
probability of at least 50 percent that claims will be made against Kirk Beauty One Group from this obligation.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized if the unavoidable costs associated with fulfilling a contractual
obligation are higher than the financial benefit expected to be drawn from the contract. When assessing
provisions for deficient lease contracts, leased properties are viewed in isolation and a provision is recognized
in the amount of the present value of any potential shortfall. Costs incurred over the base lease term are taken
into consideration if they are attributable to the lease contract. Options to decommission, close or sub-let a site
are also taken into consideration if there is a legal right to do so and the costs associated with exercising this
option constitute the least significant, unavoidable obligations to fulfil the contract. Provisions for restructuring
measures are recognized if a constructive obligation to restructure was formalized as of the balance sheet date.
This is the case if a detailed restructuring plan has been formally adopted and its key elements communicated
vis-à-vis those affected or if the implementation of the plan has already begun. Restructuring provisions only
comprise obligatory restructuring expenses.

Provisions for pensions are accounted for in line with the requirements of IAS 19. Actuarial calculations
of provisions for defined benefit plans use the projected unit credit method. As part of this measurement, the
pensions and entitlements known on the balance sheet date are taken into account as well as the increases in
salaries and pensions to be expected in future. For funded pension plans, the same interest rate chosen to
determine interest expenses resulting from the measurement of obligations is also to be used to calculate
interest income from plan assets. If changes to these calculation assumptions result in differences between the
identified pension obligations and the pension obligations determined as of the balance sheet date, actuarial
gains or losses arise. These actuarial gains and losses and other valuation changes are recognized directly in
other comprehensive income and within reserves in equity.

Plan assets designated at fair value and liabilities from pension plans are presented in a net amount.
Plan assets are maintained in qualified policies that are pledged to the employees. The interest portion
included in pension expense is presented as interest expense within the financial result. Obligations similar to
pension provisions such as part-time work schemes and termination benefits are also disclosed according to
the requirements of IAS 19.

_Financial liabilities_

Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
Transaction costs are included in the recognition of financial liabilities. If there is a difference between the
amount paid and the amount to be paid upon final maturity, this difference is amortized over the term

F-107


-----

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

according to the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation is
extinguished or expired (limitation of time). A financial liability is also derecognized if there has been a material
change in the contractual terms of an existing financial liability or part thereof. All trade accounts payable have
a maturity of less than one year and are non-interest bearing. Kirk Beauty One Group recognizes liabilities at
amortized costs comprising liabilities to banks, liabilities from Senior Notes and trade accounts payable. The
election to initially recognize financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss was not applied by the Kirk
Beauty One Group.

_Contract liabilities_

Participants in the Douglas-Group’s customer loyalty programs receive bonus points from purchases
made, which they can exchange for discount vouchers for subsequent purchases when certain thresholds are
reached.

The bonus points represent independently identifiable goods or services within the meaning of
IFRS 15 and are therefore to be recognized as a separate performance obligation.

Upon purchase, the transaction price is allocated to the independent performance obligations on the
basis of the relative individual sale prices. For the Douglas-Group, the transaction price corresponds to the
sales price of the goods and services purchased by the customer. In the absence of observable individual sales
prices for the bonus points, these are estimated on the basis of the price discount, taking into account
probabilities of redemption.

A contract liability is recognized under other financial liabilities in the amount of the performance
obligation attributable to the bonus points granted. The contractual liability is released when the bonus points
are redeemed or expire.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedging relationships_

Derivative financial instruments are in place to reduce cash flow fluctuations that result from interest
rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are neither used nor issued for speculative purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value both upon initial and subsequent
measurement and can result in a positive or negative figure. Gains and losses from fair value measurement, to
the extent that they relate to designated derivative financial instruments qualifying as hedged items, are
recognized directly in equity under a separate equity item in line with the rules for hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedged items to hedge against cash flow risks are
measured at fair value and recognized in profit or loss. The amounts recorded under equity increase or reduce
profit or loss as soon as the hedged cash flows from the underlying transaction are recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to the amount the Group company either
would have to pay or would receive upon termination of the financial instrument on the balance sheet date.
The calculation of the fair value takes into account the interest rates and forward rates in effect as of the balance
sheet date. Derivative financial instruments are only used as cash flow hedges. By way of such cash flow
hedges, the Kirk Beauty One Group hedged the exposure to future variability in cash flows attributable to
interest rate risks.

With regard to currency rate risks non-derivative financial liabilities as part of a net investment hedge
are implemented to cover currency rate risks arising from net investments in non-Group foreign currencies.
Accounting for net investment hedges generally follows the rules for cash flow hedges.

No business transactions to be recognized under the rules for hedge accounting existed either as of
the balance sheet date or as of the prior-year balance sheet date.

_Revenue recognition_

Sales are recognized on delivery of goods or after the performance of a service is complete.
Obligations from customer loyalty programs, such as bonus points, are measured at fair value and offset
directly against sales. Sales arising therefrom are first recognized upon redemption of the bonus points.

F-108


-----

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

Deferred sales are reversed or utilized in line with the way customers redeem their gift vouchers and are also
reported under sales. Interest income and interest expense are recognized in the financial result on an accrual
basis.

_Use of judgements_

Judgement was applied in particular in relation to the assessment of the level of control in
determining the scope of consolidation[6] and to determine whether leases were operating leases or finance
leases[7]. In applying IFRS 9 for the first time, the calculation of valuation allowances is also based on
discretionary decisions, in particular with regard to the probability of scenarios occurring and credit risk (loss
rate).

_Assumptions and estimates_

Assumptions and estimates have been made in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements that impact the disclosure and amount of the assets and liabilities, income and expenses carried in
these statements. These assumptions and estimates were used, in particular, in the determination of useful
lives[8], valuing provisions and pension provisions[9], assessing the impairment of goodwill[10], measuring
provisions[11] and uncertain tax positions and measuring instruments which are issued as part of share-based
payment programs[12] as well as estimating the probability that future tax refunds will be realized. In addition,
assumptions and estimates are of significance in determining the fair values and acquisition costs associated

As in the previous year, impairment losses on trade accounts receivable classified to the category
“measured at amortized cost” are reported under other operating expenses, unless they are determined using
the expected credit loss model according to the first-time adoption of IFRS 9. These impairment losses are
shown separately in the income statement. Fair value measurement of financial assets classified to the category
“at fair value through profit or loss” leads to a financial expense of €1.7 million (prior year: €8.3 million) in the
financial year.

Depreciation/amortization amounted to €121.3 million (prior year: €151.8 million).

Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment at store level, as cash-generating units (CGUs),
lead to write-downs totaling €7.8 million (prior year: €10.4 million), of which €4.3 million (prior year: €6.0
million) were attributable to the geographical segment Germany, €2.1 million (prior year: €0.2 million) to
France, €0.8 million (prior year: €2.9 million) to South-Western Europe and €0.6 million (prior year: €1.3 million)
to Eastern Europe. Impairment tests are performed on stores if they provide ongoing negative profit
contributions or are planned to be closed.

For impairment testing the carrying amount of the CGU or rather groups of CGUs is compared to its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as being the value in use based on discounted
future cash flows from internal forecasts. Planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit/EBITDA
forecasts, estimates of replacement investments in the store network, the ratio of personnel expenses to sales
and other cost ratios relating to individual stores. The forecasts are based on the residual term of the respective
lease agreements excluding any extension options. The forecast term is between one and ten years.
Calculations are based on interest rates of between 5.1 percent and 9.2 percent before taxes.

The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives amounted to a total of €2,253.9
million (prior year: €2,250.4 million) as of the balance sheet date, of which €1,513.7 million (prior year: €1,506.4
million) is attributable to goodwill. A further €534.4 million is attributable to the Douglas brand, as in the prior
year, and €172.7 million to the Nocibé brand, as in the prior year. As the brands are powered by ongoing
brand maintenance measures, the Group considers their useful lives to be indefinite. The Douglas brand was
allocated to the segment Germany; the Nocibé brand was allocated to France. In addition, French location
advantages associated with leasehold interests purchased from prior tenants were capitalized at €33.1 million
(prior year: €36.9 million) in relation to the useful lives and irrespective of the terms of the lease contracts.

Goodwill, trademarks with indefinite useful lives and location advantages associated with leasehold
interests with indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test once each year. As is the case for
impairment tests for tangible assets, the carrying amount of the CGU (or groups of CGUs) is compared to the
recoverable amount of the CGU (or groups of CGUs), with the recoverable amount in the Kirk Beauty One
Group being defined as the value in use based on discounted future cash flows from internal forecasts.
Planning assumptions include sales growth, gross profit and EBITDA forecasts, estimated development of
costs, estimates of replacement investments in the store network and the development of working capital.
Forecasts are based on management estimates and experience from the past as well as macroeconomic data.

The underlying forecasts used to determine the value in use are based on detailed forecast periods of
three years, which corresponds to the companies’ standardized forecasting system, and the perpetual annuity
applying from this point.

In the detailed planning phase, we anticipate slightly higher average annual revenue growth for the
segment Austria and moderately higher annual revenue growth for France and Italy. Solid growth is expected
in the Netherlands and Spain. Solid growth is expected in Germany and strong growth in Poland. We expect a
slight increase in market share in all aforementioned countries. We assume that we will be able to largely
compensate for future increases in costs due to our market penetration on the one hand and the
implementation of efficiency enhancement measures on the other, so that we expect moderately declining
EBITDA margins in France and Poland, almost unchanged EBITDA margins in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands
and Austria and slightly higher EBITDA margins in Spain. All other business segments not mentioned here only
play a minor role regarding the amount of goodwill allocated to them.

The calculation of the perpetual annuity is based on a risk-adjusted growth rate of 1.0 percent.

Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives did not result in any
impairment of goodwill in the reporting period (previous year: €155.0 million in Germany and €29.5 million in
Spain; the remaining carrying amount of goodwill in Spain is €0). After taking into account the addition to
goodwill of €7.4 million from the acquisition of Niche Beauty, the carrying amount of goodwill in Germany
amounts to €603.4 million. The recoverable amount for Germany was €1,239.4 million.

In addition to impairment testing, three sensitivity analyses were performed for each business
segment. The first sensitivity analysis was based on the assumption of a 1.0 percentage point decline in the
EBITDA growth rate. In the second sensitivity analysis, the weighted average cost of capital was raised by
5.0 percent. In the third sensitivity analysis, a reduction of 5.0 percent instead of a growth surcharge of
1.0 percent was applied to the assumed perpetual EBITDA. These changes to underlying parameters would
lead to impairment losses for the business segments Germany, Austria and Latvia.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

In the impairment test of the business segment Germany, including the acquisition of Niche Beauty,
the value in use exceeded the carrying amount by €106.6 million. The value in use would equate to the carrying
amount in case of a 9.1 percentage points lower growth rate or weighted average cost of capital after tax of
6.6 percent, or a perpetual 8.6 percent fall in EBITDA instead of a 1.0 percent rise in EBITDA.

In the impairment test for the business segment Austria, the value in use exceeded the carrying
amount by €1.1 million. The value in use would equate to the carrying amount in case of a 0.9 percentage point
lower growth rate or weighted average cost of capital after tax of 6.5 percent or a perpetual 1.0 percent fall in
EBITDA instead of a 1.0 percent rise in EBITDA.

In the impairment test for the business segment Latvia, the value in use exceeded the carrying amount
by €0.6 million. The value in use would equate to the carrying amount in case of a 2.2 percentage point lower
growth rate or weighted average cost of capital after tax of 8.1 percent or a perpetual 2.2 percent fall in
EBITDA instead of a 1.0 percent rise in EBITDA.

As of the balance sheet date, no intangible assets or property, plant and equipment have been
pledged as collateral for bank loans.

_Operating leases_

Contracts qualifying as operating leases within the Kirk Beauty One Group mostly comprise store
rental agreements. As a rule, these agreements are concluded for a basic rental period of five years and
contain lease extension options. The values shown do not include any lease extension options. The lease
installments are either based on variable or fixed rental payments. Minimum lease payments from operating
leases totaled €281.5 million (prior year: €281.6 million). Contingent

lease payments resulting from sales-based lease agreements stood at €0.7 million as of the balance
sheet date (prior year: €1.0 million).

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

The temporary differences taken as a basis for the calculation of deferred taxes mainly result from fair
value measurements of assets in the course of business combinations as well as the revaluation of financial
assets in accordance with IFRS 9. Deferred tax expenses in the amount of €0.7 million (prior year: €0.4 million)
for pension provisions were directly recognized in other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2019, no
deferred tax assets were recognized regarding tax losses carried forward of €314.1 million (prior year: €305.9
million). Of this amount, €12.4 million will expire in the next seven years. Tax loss carryforwards in the amount
of €8.7 million (prior year: €0.1 million), for which no deferred tax assets had been recognized, were utilized in
the period under review.

Deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards were recognized for entities which forecasts gave substantial
indications of recoverability.

In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax liabilities are recognized on the difference between the equity
share of a subsidiary included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the carrying amount of
the investment in the subsidiary recognized in the parent company’s tax balance sheet (outside basis
differences), if realization is expected. As of the balance sheet date, outside basis differences amounted to
€19.2 million (prior year: €19.8 million), for which no deferred taxes were recognized.

Write-downs to the net realizable value resulted in impairment losses of €32.6 million in the period
ended September 30, 2019 (prior year: €87.0 million).

14. Trade accounts receivable

Trade accounts receivable primarily include receivables from credit card organizations as well as from
Douglas Card customers. Write-downs due to default risks came to €9.9 million (prior year: €8.3 million) in the
financial year 2018/19.

Write-downs on trade accounts receivable are shown under other operating expenses, unless they are
determined using the expected credit loss model according to the first-time adoption of IFRS 9. These
impairment losses are shown separately in the income statement. Trade accounts receivable are due
immediately, do not bear interest and are therefore not exposed to any interest rate risk. The carrying amounts
of the receivables are basically equivalent to their fair values. The (theoretical) maximum default risk as of the
balance sheet date corresponds to the carrying amount.

_Assessment of expected credit losses_

In order to estimate the expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable, an allowance matrix is
used.

The default risk is mainly influenced by individual characteristics of customers and the geographical
location. In order to calculate expected credit losses, trade accounts receivable with comparable credit risk
characteristics are classified into different portfolios based on geographical location and customer
characteristics. Historical patterns of payment behavior and the ageing structure of receivables are analyzed
individually for each portfolio and used as a starting point for determining the loss rate. Together with the
amount at risk of default, the expected credit loss is determined for each portfolio and maturity band. The
calculated loss rate per portfolio is adjusted downstream if significant changes in the macroeconomic situation
are expected.

15. Financial assets

_Other financial assets_

Other financial assets include long-term receivables from shareholders, bonus/advertising cost
subsidies, equity investments and other financial receivables. Except for equity investments, other financial
assets are classified and measured on the basis of the business model and the cash flow criterion. All other
financial assets are managed within the business model “hold” and the cash flow criterion is considered
fulfilled. Consequently, they are measured at amortized cost, except for equity investments. Due to the
measurement at amortized cost, an estimate was also made of the expected credit losses, which were
quantified as insignificant.

Equity participations are investments in equity instruments, which are measured at fair value through
profit or loss. There was no intention to sell said equity participations as of the balance sheet date. Depending
on how the equity instruments are managed, they are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

For the effect of the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 on financial instruments, see Note 2 “New Accounting
Standards”. Due to the chosen transition method, comparative information has not been restated.

Receivables against shareholders are interest-bearing. Receivables from supplier bonuses and
advertising subsidies are due very quickly and do not bear interest.

Equity participations are investments in equity instruments of unlisted companies. There was no
intention to sell said equity participations as of the balance sheet date; they are measured at fair value through
profit or loss. For the Spanish investment in GPD Group a fair value was determined on the basis of expected
profit distributions.

Other financial assets include receivables from rental agreements of €25.8 million (prior year: €22.5
million).

All other financial assets are non-interest-bearing financial instruments. The carrying amounts of other
financial assets are basically equivalent to their fair values.

As of the balance sheet date, other financial assets in the amount of €0.0 million (prior year: €1.2
million) had been pledged as collateral for bank loans and Senior Notes.

The level 2 impairment relates to receivables from the shareholder Kirk Beauty Two GmbH with a
gross carrying amount of €625.7 million (prior year: €578.3 million). The classification results from liquidly
traded bonds of the shareholder´s investment, which are quoted below the issue price. The credit risk was
derived from credit default swaps, based on a “B” rating (Moody’s) dated February 21, 2019, which results in a
probability of default depending on the remaining term and a loss given default of 63 percent. The contracts
contain termination rights which are not shown separately in the balance sheet and which are taken into
account in the credit exposure via various scenarios. There is no objective evidence of impairment or a
fundamentally impaired creditworthiness for these receivables.

_Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities_

###### The amounts not offset on the balance sheet include both derivative financial instruments (caps) and their outstanding purchase price payment. Set-off agreements or similar agreements exist for these financial instruments; however, they do not meet the set-off criteria according to IAS 32.

16. Other assets

Other assets primarily include prepaid expenses.

17. Cash and cash equivalents

The largest item of cash and cash equivalents is bank balances (original term up to 3 months). It also
includes checks and cash in hand. Cash and cash equivalents represent highly liquid financial investments that
can be converted into cash at any time and are only subject to insignificant fluctuations in value. The
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides a detailed analysis of the movement in cash and cash
equivalents. The (theoretical) maximum default risk corresponds to the carrying value as of the balance sheet
date.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

Kirk Beauty One GmbH allocates cash and cash equivalents to the business model “hold”. Based on
the business model and the fulfilment of the cash flow criterion, cash and cash equivalents are measured at
amortized cost. All book values correspond to the fair values.

Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to the general approach of the
expected credit loss model. As Kirk Beauty One GmbH only makes investments in counterparties with at least
investment grade rating (BBB-), a low credit risk is assumed for these financial instruments. Kirk Beauty One
GmbH uses credit default swap spreads and rating information to determine the expected credit losses for
cash and cash equivalents. The calculated amount of expected credit losses is insignificant.

As of the balance sheet date, bank balances in the amount of €52.9 million (prior year: €76,0 million)
had been pledged as collateral for bank loans and Senior Notes. Under the terms of agreement, all rights and
powers in respect of the accounts may be fully exercised so that the pledged bank balances continue to form
part of cash and cash equivalents.

Security can only be enforced by the lenders if the majority of them instruct the agent to make the
debt due and payable with immediate effect. This requires a prior breach of the terms of the contract, which
has not been resolved before the expiration of a specified grace period.

18. Equity

_Capital stock_

Issued capital stock remained unchanged at €25,000.00 on the balance sheet date. Capital was
entirely paid-in.

_Additional paid-in capital_

Additional paid-in capital includes capital contributions of Kirk Beauty One GmbH shareholders in
excess of subscribed capital.

gains and losses from pension provisions in 2018/19 and the prior year.

Other reserves include valuation effects of €51.3 million, net of deferred tax, from the first-time
adoption of IFRS 9, recognized directly in equity.

_Profit appropriation / loss compensation claim_

Kirk Beauty Two GmbH is the sole shareholder of Kirk Beauty One GmbH. A profit and loss transfer
agreement was concluded between Kirk Beauty One GmbH and Kirk Beauty Two GmbH effective as of
October 1, 2015 as part of the establishment of a corporation tax and trade tax group. In the separate financial
statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH prepared according to the German Commercial Code (HGB) for the
period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019, a loss for the period, before profit or loss transfer,
of €2.8 million (prior year: €90.4 million) was incurred and compensated by Kirk Beauty Two GmbH. The loss

19. Pension provisions

Pension provisions are recognized for funded and non-funded employer-financed commitments
arising from pension entitlements and ongoing payments to employees and former employees as well as their
surviving dependents. They are also recognized for purely employee-funded commitments from deferred
compensation. The pension entitlements usually relate to payments for contractually agreed retirement
pensions as a monthly amount. These commitments are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of
IAS 19. Accordingly, actuarial gains/losses are recognized directly and in full via a separate equity component.

Valuations are based on actuarial reports using the following parameters.

Pension payments in the amount of €2.3 million and contributions to plan assets in the amount of
€0.5 million are expected for the period ended September 30, 2020. An increase of 0.7 percentage points in
the discount rate would reduce the present value of the defined benefit obligations by €5.7 million. A decrease
of 0.7 percentage points in the discount rate would increase the benefit obligations by €6.8 million. An increase
or a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in the expected pension trend with all other parameters remaining
unchanged would increase the present value of the defined benefit obligations by €3.2 million or decrease the
present value of the defined benefit obligations by €1.7 million, respectively. The weighted average duration of
all obligations is 15.5 years as of the balance sheet date.

24. Consolidated Cash Flow Statement

The consolidated cash flow statement shows how the cash and cash equivalents balance of the Group
changed during the period ended September 30, 2019 as a result of cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities.

Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2019 stood at €81.0 million (prior year: €102.9 million).

Cash inflow from operating activities totaled €198.3 million (prior year: €129.0 million) in the period
ended September 30, 2019. The increase in provisions of €29.4 million (prior year: decrease of €22.9 million)
includes the change in non-current and current provisions, corrected for additions from company acquisitions,
which are reported in cash flow from investing activities. Changes in working capital (without liabilities from
investments in non-current assets) of minus €39.7 million (prior year: minus €9.1 million) and changes in other
assets and liabilities not classifiable to investing or financing activities in the amount of minus €5.3 million (prior
year: minus €8.8 million) show the change in the corresponding positions, adjusted for amounts attributable to
investing or financing activities.

Working capital of the Douglas-Group comprises inventories, trade accounts receivable, trade
accounts payable (including liabilities from investments in non-current assets), receivables from advertising
cost contributions, sales promotion and supplier bonuses as well as liabilities from coupons not yet redeemed.

Cash outflow for investing activities came to €106.4 million (prior year: €389.5 million) in the period
ended September 30, 2019. €3.5 million were attributable to acquisitions (prior year: €298.3 million). The sale
of the former headquarter property in Hagen resulted in a cash inflow from investing activities of €23.2 million.

Payments for the acquisition of consolidated companies and other business units concern the
acquisition of Niche Beauty. The cash-effective acquisition costs of Niche Beauty amounted to €3.5 million.

The net cash outflow for financing activities in the amount of €113.6 million (prior year: net cash
inflow of €185.3 million) mainly results from interest payments (in the prior year mainly from taking out a bank
loan as part of the senior facility agreement in the amount of €300.0 million and opposing interest payments of
€109.1 million).

25. Segment reporting

As the leading specialty retailer in Europe, the Douglas-Group operates in 26 European countries with
2,431 perfumeries (including franchise branches) and a variety of online web shops, in which primarily
perfumery, cosmetic and skincare products and food supplements are sold to end customers. Business is
conducted on the basis of an omnichannel approach that interlinks the store and online business in a way that
ensures that customers are optimally served via both channels.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

The reporting segments are categorized on the basis of their organizational and decision-making
structure and the content of the internal reporting to the chief operating decision-maker.

The Board of Directors of Douglas GmbH is the chief operating decision-maker in the meaning of
IFRS 8. It steers the Douglas-Group, it is responsible for allocating resources to the business segments at the
highest level and it assesses and monitors their profitability. The Board of Directors of Douglas GmbH is also
the Board of Directors of Kirk Beauty One GmbH.

Below the chief operating decision-maker, the segment managers are responsible for the operating
business and in turn report to the chief operating decision-maker.

Based on the internal organizational and reporting structure, the segment managers will operate at
country level, which means that steering and monitoring by the chief operating decision-maker will also take
place on country level.

The segments Germany and France are shown separately in the segment reporting (reportable
segments), as they differ considerably from the other countries (market position and market strategy,
particularly with the market presence under the Nocibé brand in France).

The current and expected gross profit margins and EBITDA margins, market position, economic
circumstances, customer base, sales organization, supplier structure and regulatory environment in the SouthWestern European countries Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Switzerland, Monaco and Andorra
on the one hand and the Eastern European countries Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia and Estonia on the other hand are mostly homogeneous. For this reason,
the individual operating segments were combined under the reportable segments South-Western Europe and
Eastern Europe.

Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty were allocated to the reportable segment Germany since
Parfumdreams and Niche Beauty are steered and controlled from Germany and generate the majority of their
revenues in Germany as well.

As of the balance sheet date, the Douglas-Group’s reportable segments were Germany, France,
South-Western Europe and Eastern Europe.

With exception of adjustments for expenses and income that the management considers to be “nonrecurring effects on a regular basis”, the segment results of the operating segments are determined in
accordance with the IFRS accounting and valuation methods as presented in Notes 3 to 5 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements as well as in consideration of IFRS 8. Transfers between segments are
generally performed at the same prices that would apply if the transactions were executed with third parties
(arm’s length transactions).

The recognized segment sales correspond to sales with external third parties. Internal sales account
for sales between individual segments. The allocation of segment sales is based on the registered office of the
selling unit.

The segment performance indicator is adjusted EBITDA. Alongside sales, adjusted EBITDA is the
Douglas-Group’s key financial performance indicator that is used to assess the performance of the segments
and manage resource allocation. Adjusted EBITDA is also decisive for calculating the underlying covenants of
loan financing. To calculate adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA reported in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss
is adjusted for items that Kirk Beauty One management considers to be “non-recurring effects on a regular
basis”. In addition, credit card fees included in reported EBITDA are classified as financial expenses and
reclassified to the financial result.

The monthly reporting to the chief operating decision-maker only shows the inventories of individual
segments as segment assets. Inventories shown in segment reporting include purchased goods, raw materials,
consumables and supplies and advance payments for inventories.

Capital expenditure shown in segment reporting relates to additions made to intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment.

The adjustment categories “Purchase Price Allocations”, “Restructuring costs and severance

following matters.

hidden reserves disclosed in relation to business combinations

    - Restructuring costs and severance payments: Settlements and ongoing salary payments
irrespective of whether a position has been reappointed

    - Write-down of inventories: In particular relating to the rebranding of our brand presence and the
renewal of the product range of our own brands (prior year: restructuring and integration of our
acquisitions in Spain and Italy)

    - Consulting fees: In relation to strategic projects, acquisitions and financing

    - Credit card fees: Fees charged for the use of credit cards are classified as financial expenses

    - Other non-recurring effects on a regular basis: Mainly proceeds from the sale of the former

€0.2 million)

In addition, internal licensing costs and other similar costs charged from the segment Germany to the
segments South-Western Europe and Eastern Europe were not included in the presentation of segment
EBITDA and adjusted segment EBITDA, in accordance with the internal steering logic.

In order to calculate adjusted profit or loss for the period, impairment losses on non-current assets,
write-downs on liabilities, valuation effects within financial result and tax effects on these adjustments are
adjusted. The calculation was based on an unchanged tax rate of 32 percent as in the prior year.

26. Fair value of financial instruments

The following tables represent the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments as of the
balance sheet date. The items are classified according to IFRS 9[13] (prior year: according to IAS 39[14]) and are
also categorized into a three-stage fair value hierarchy, which structures the data used for the fair value
calculation according to its market relevance.

Fair values of the Notes liabilities are calculated on the basis of market prices quoted on active
markets (level 1).

A mark-to-market measurement based on yield curves available on the market is conducted for the
interest rate caps presented as derivative financial instruments under “Assets” (level 2).

In connection with the acquisition of the LLG Group, Douglas has committed itself to an additional
contingent purchase price tranche, in case that certain goals and synergies agreed between the contractual
partners are reached within 18 months after the date of acquisition. These concern the closing of a defined
number of stores and of the central warehouse on the one hand and the achievement of synergy effects
affecting the result on the other hand. The liability is measured at fair value, in accordance with level 3 of the
measurement hierarchy of IFRS 13. Evaluation was conducted based on expected amounts, with the
expectations of management relating to the achievement being objectified using a standard deviation.

Input factors primarily were the number of expected store closures and the amount of synergies likely
to be realized. Within a range between €5.0 million and €15.0 million, the liability was valued at €10.6 million as
of the acquisition date. All conditions were fulfilled as of September 30, 2019. The fair value of the liability
amounts to €15.0 million as of the balance sheet date. The extent of achievement realized as of September 30,
2019 will lead to a purchase price payment of €15.0 million, so there is no sensitivity of the fair value.

The contingent purchase price liability associated with the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent of
the shares in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH was recognized as a liability to minority shareholders at its fair value of
€5.2 million as of the balance sheet date. The remaining 49 percent of the shares were acquired with economic
effect from January 1, 2022 and subject to the condition precedent of payment of the second purchase price
tranche. The purchase price of the 49 percent stake is also determined by the achievement of certain economic
performance indicators. The lower limit is €3.5 million, the upper limit €6.0 million. The expected value was
determined on the basis of an equal distribution of the performance indicators within a range around the
target achievement level. The expected value was discounted at an interest rate of 1.5 percent. The sensitivity
of the fair value lies between the lower limit of €3.5 million and the upper limit of €6.0 million.

In terms of trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable, fair values equal the carrying
amounts due to the short maturities involved. In case of receivables from the parent company Kirk Beauty Two

GmbH, the book value is identical to the fair value as well, as the interest rate was negotiated in accordance
with standard market conditions. Since then, market interest rates have changed slightly. On the other hand,
the credit risk has increased. Since the carrying amount already takes the credit risk until maturity into account,
it substantially equals fair value still.

Fair values of liabilities to banks are based on expected cash flows within the range of contractual
agreements, discounted with a credit-risk-adjusted rate. Calculating the fair value of the syndicated bank loan,
a particularity exists. In addition to the variable EURIBOR base rate, adjustments to the credit margin are also
regularly made within legally defined boundaries. Credit margins are reassessed on a quarterly basis,
regarding the development of certain corporate key figures. The reassessment is based on ratios that the
syndicate would also include in the assessment of credit risk. As a result, interest expectations as of the balance
sheet date are largely equivalent to fair credit interest assessment. As there were no interest accruals as of the
balance sheet date, the fair value only deviates from the face value of the liability to an immaterial extent.

Fair values of other financial instruments are calculated using the present values of contractually
agreed payments in consideration of country-specific interest yield curves.

Equity participations are measured at fair value. No sale of these equity participations is planned as of
the balance sheet date.

27. Management of financial risks

The financial management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH is responsible for the Group’s financing and
supports decision-makers of German and foreign Group companies in respect of all financial issues.

The financial risks relevant to the Group, such as liquidity risks, the risk of interest rate changes, default
risks and risks from cash flow fluctuations are adequately controlled and monitored by the financial
management of Kirk Beauty One GmbH.

_Liquidity risk_

The Group generally has access to various sources for the funding of business operations, investments
and potential acquisitions. This includes existing cash and cash equivalents, net cash flow from operating
activities and bank credits as well as Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes.

All the German subsidiaries and the significant subsidiaries based abroad are linked to a cash
management system (cash pooling). By combining financing volumes, short-term liquidity surpluses of
individual Group companies can be used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies. This
leads to a reduction of the debt financing volume and an optimization of cash investments, thus having a
positive impact on the Group’s net interest result.

As of the balance sheet date, financing agreements totaled €2,505.0 million and comprised the
following.

    - €300.0 million Senior Secured Notes and €335.0 million Senior Notes,

    - €1,670.0 million Senior Facility Agreement (“Term Loan B Facility”), consisting of €1,370.0 million
from “Term Loan Facility B1” and €300.0 million from “Term Loan Facility B2” and

    - €200.0 million from a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF).

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes bear fixed interest rates of 6.25 percent and 8.75
percent respectively. The interest on the “Term Loan Facility B1” of €1,370.0 million is based on EURIBOR plus a
margin of 3.5 percent. EURIBOR plus a margin of 3.25 percent has been agreed for the “Term Loan Facility B2”
in the amount of €300.0 million. The Senior Facility Agreement contains a 0.0 percent EURIBOR floor (prior
year: 0.0 percent).

The Senior Facility Agreement has a maturity until August 2022 and the Revolving Credit Facility until
February 2022. The Senior Secured Notes mature in July 2022 and the Unsecured Senior Notes mature in July
2023.

The Senior Secured Notes as well the Senior Facility Agreement are secured by collateral. The
following assets were pledged as collateral: bank balances, shares in certain Group companies and internal
accounts receivable as well as assets from interest cap agreements.

In the event of borrower default, the lenders have the opportunity to initiate a contractually defined
procedure, which aims to bring about the immediate due payment of the liability and the utilization of the
pledged collateral.

The Group also has access to a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €200.0 million, which was
limited solely for lease sureties in the amount of €13.8 million as of the balance sheet date (prior year: €7.8
million). Individual companies also have access to bilateral credit lines, none of which (prior year: €0.0 million)
had been utilized as of the balance sheet date.

Kirk Beauty One GmbH and its subsidiaries have to meet certain other obligations and key financial
covenants, if 40.0 percent of the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn. The utilization of the revolving credit facility
for lease sureties in the amount of €13.8 million does not have any impact on compliance with the financial
covenants agreed in the loan agreement. As a result, compliance with these financial covenants is not relevant
as of the period ended September 30, 2019.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

All financial liabilities existing as of the balance sheet date and for which payments were already
contractually agreed are included in the table. Payments for future liabilities which did not exist as of the
balance sheet date are not included. Floating interest rate payments were determined on the basis of the
interest rates known as of the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities cancellable at all times are always
classified to the earliest time slot. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euros using the
closing rate.

_Interest rate risk_

The interest rate risk is the result of fluctuations in interest rates on the capital markets. The loans
attributable to the Group from the Senior Facility Agreement generally bear variable interest based on the
EURIBOR. In addition, the Senior Facility Agreement of €1,670 million contains an interest rate floor, which is
effective at 0.0 percent. To reduce the risk of cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates of variable
loans, the Group entered into interest rate hedging agreements.

Interest rate caps are in place to hedge against the risk of interest rate fluctuations over a total nominal
volume of €1,100.0 million. These caps reduce the risk of an increase in EURIBOR to a maximum of 1.0 percent.
The resulting cash flows can affect the interest result during the period from October 1, 2015 through
September 30, 2021. The Senior Facility Agreement contains an interest rate floor at 0.0 percent EURIBOR. The
cash flows from this agreement will affect the interest result until August 13, 2022.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the interest rate risk. Subject to this analysis was the
Senior Facility Agreement, which bears interest rate risks based on the EURIBOR as far as it is not part of a
hedging relationship. A relative increase in the interest rate by 100 base points would affect interest expenses
in the amount of roughly €10.2 million.

_Currency risk_

Operating units of the Kirk Beauty One Group largely conduct their activities in the respective
functional currency. The currency risk of the Group is considered to be low, as 91 percent of the Group’s sales
(prior year: 91 percent) were effected in euros in the period ended September 30, 2019 and merchandise was
purchased almost exclusively in euros. Differences arising from the translation of foreign currencies to the
parent’s currency for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements do not impact currency risk.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted in line with the requirements of IFRS 7. This analysis includes the
effects from foreign currency positions measured at the closing date rate pursuant to IAS 21 through profit or
loss.

The effects recognized in profit or loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on financial
instruments denominated in foreign currency but not designated as hedged items as part of foreign currency
hedging transactions have been included in the sensitivity analysis. This means that Kirk Beauty One Group
would be exposed to risks—both in isolation and cumulatively—of under €100,000 in the event of an
improvement or deterioration in the value of the Euro exchange rate of 5 percent.

_Default risk_

Default risk is the risk of financial losses if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The default risk generally arises from all financial assets in the portfolio, such
as trade accounts receivable, other receivables, cash investments with bank partners and derivatives with a
positive market value. The carrying amounts of the financial assets and contract assets correspond to the
maximum default risk.

Arising from the increased focus of the e-commerce channel, the entities of the Kirk Beauty One
Group are faced with a receivables default risk, which is a system-inherent risk in mail-order retail. For this

F-134

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

reason, the companies operate an effective and constantly optimized debtor management system including
consistent dunning procedures.

A default risk may arise from the default of a banking partner, in particular as a result of insolvency in
the context of financial investments or positive market values from derivatives. The Kirk Beauty One Group
counters this risk by concluding transactions concerning both financial investments and financial instruments
exclusively with first-class banks. At the same time, the volume is distributed among several counterparties in
order to avoid concentration risks. Due to the difficult global economic situation, larger financial investments
are avoided as far as possible or only concluded with first-class German banks.

_Capital management_

The subject of capital management is equity under IFRS. The goal of the Kirk Beauty One Group’s
capital management is to assure that the Group can continue to meet its financial obligations and that the
covenants from the syndicated loans are met. A further goal of capital management is to increase the
enterprise value on a long-term basis. A secondary aim of the capital management strategy is to ensure that all
Group companies have appropriate equity according to local needs, such that external capital requirements
were always met in the past financial year. This is to be achieved through the constant improvement of cash
flow and EBITDA.

Net debt is defined as the sum of liabilities to banks and Notes liabilities, offset by cash and cash
equivalents.

28. Liabilities to minority shareholders

Regarding the minority shareholders of one subsidiary in Bulgaria, an obligation exists to acquire their
shares as soon as they are tendered by the minority shareholders. Additionally, one German partnership has
cancellation rights with the consequence that in the event of termination, compensation at fair value would be
payable to the minority shareholders. This results in a commitment of €3.6 million (prior year: €3.5 million) as of
the balance sheet date.

The contingent selling price for the shares in Profumerie Douglas S.p.A. agreed in connection with the
acquisition of the Limoni and La Gardenia Group with the parent company of the selling companies, Orlando
Italy S.r.l., was recognized at its fair value of €15.0 million (prior year: €14.7 million) as a liability to minority
shareholders as of the balance sheet date.

The fair value of the minimum purchase price liability for the acquisition of the remaining minority
interests in Parfümerie AKZENTE GmbH in the amount of €7.6 million (prior year: €7.4 million) is presented as a
liability to minority shareholders as well.

The contingent purchase price liability associated with the acquisition of the remaining 49 percent
interest in Niche-Beauty.COM GmbH was recognized at its fair value of €5.2 million as a liability to minority
shareholders as of the balance sheet date.

29. Other explanatory notes

_Other financial commitments_

Purchase commitments for approved capital expenditure in property, plant and equipment totaled
€30.8 million as of the balance sheet date (prior year: €28.4 million).

F-136

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

Board of Management and their surviving dependents amounted to €1.2 million (prior year: €1.0 million).
Pension obligations (DBO) to former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents
amounted to €21.9 million as of September 30, 2019 (prior year: €18.8 million).

Expenses for short-term benefits to key management personnel, which includes the Board of
Management of the Kirk Beauty One Group and the Supervisory Board of Douglas GmbH, amount to
€3.0 million (prior year: €3.0 million), of which €0.2 million (prior year: € 0.2 million) is attributable to the
Supervisory Board. Expenses for termination benefits of key management personnel amounted to €0.2 million
(prior year: €0.0 million). In accordance with IFRS 2, expenses from share-based payments to key management
personnel amounted to €0.0 million (prior year: €0.0 million).

_Share-based payments_

A management participation program for key employees and other executive employees of the Group
has been set up in a management participation company, established as a shareholder of Kirk Beauty
International S.A., a company above the group of consolidated companies of Kirk Beauty One GmbH. This
management participation program allows the management and other management personnel to invest in the
Douglas-Group and, in the event of the current majority shareholder departing (through a sale or IPO),
participate in the anticipated value increase. The management participation program grants members the
opportunity to indirectly acquire shares in Kirk Beauty International S.A. in a particular structure. The
participants’ investment allows them to indirectly participate in the returns and value developments of a
defined portfolio consisting of ordinary shares, preferred shares and preferred equity certificates (PECs).
Preferred shares and PECs have defined returns on capital employed. PECs take precedence over preferred
shares, which in turn take precedence over ordinary shares, when it comes to servicing.

Given that Kirk Beauty One Group companies are not obliged to settle share-based payments
themselves, this constitutes a share-based payment with settlement through equity instruments in accordance
with IFRS 2.43B (b).

The purchase prices for the transfer of shares to members of the management participation program
who joined the program when it was established were determined on the basis of the purchase price of the
former Beauty Holding Group (now Kirk Beauty One Group) on August 13, 2015. The purchase prices of the
shares of participants who joined the program at a later date were determined according to the portfolio value
calculated on the basis of a mark-to-market valuation of the Group (using the latest company planning and
multiples derived from market data). In valuing the preferred shares and the PECs, the amount of the
contractually agreed accumulated interest and preferred dividends amortized to the joining date is taken into
consideration.

Members may only sell acquired shares to Kirk Beauty Investments S.A. If a member leaves the
program, Kirk Beauty Investments S.A. is entitled to buy back his shares (call option).

If they sell their shares prematurely or leave the Kirk Beauty One Group as “good leavers,” members
shall receive a payment for a contractually defined share of the portfolio, which is vested until the date of
departure, equating to the higher of the current market value of the shares or the purchase price less any
received reimbursements. For the non-vested share, “good leavers” receive the lower of the current market
value or the purchase price less any received reimbursements. Five years after the accession date, “good
leavers” receive 100 percent of the market value of their portfolio upon termination. “Bad leavers” receive the
lower of current market value and purchase price.

If a defined exit event occurs (which may include an initial public offering or a similar transaction, in
which all or substantially all of the Group’s assets are sold, so that the current investors retain less than 50
percent of the shares), the proceeds from the sale, after the deduction of costs, will be used to service the
above-mentioned instruments, including accrued interest, in the following order: PECs, preferred shares and
lastly ordinary shares. Investors are required to cooperate in an exit event and participate pro rata in the
proceeds of the sale in accordance with the portfolio they hold.

In order to determine IFRS 2 personnel expense for the period, the purchase prices to be paid by plan
participants were compared to the fair values of the share classes at the respective grant date. If plan
participants have purchased instruments at a price below fair value, the grant date fair value is determined as
the difference between purchase price and fair value at the accession date. Fair values of the instruments were
determined by means of discounted cash flow assessments of the Kirk Beauty One Group, based on business
plans valid on the grant dates, taking into account the seasonal development of working capital and the
change in net debt.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf as at September 30, 2019

The cost of capital parameters were derived on a quarterly basis and include the risk-free interest
calculated using the Svensson methodology, the relevant market risk premium, the average unlevered beta
and debt-equity ratio derived from the applicable peer group and a country- specific weighted tax rate. In
addition, a weighted country-specific risk premium according to Damodaran and a credit spread between a
ten-year German government bond and a bond determined using a synthetic rating of the Kirk Beauty One
Group were taken into account.

The resulting enterprise value has been allocated to the different share classes and PECs, taking into
account the nominal values of PECs and preferred shares as option prices for the valuation of the classes of
instruments according to the Black-Scholes method, including contractual and accumulated interest and
preferred dividend amounts and any repurchase programs as of the accession date. Black-Scholes models
were calculated using the same assumptions regarding risk- free interest rate, volatility and expected maturity
of the program, which was set at five years beginning August 15, 2015. It was also assumed that no plan
participants will leave the program within the remaining term and that no dividends will be paid or repurchase
programs will be executed. The calculation of purchase prices per instrument for the three share classes takes
into account a discount for the lack of marketability (“DLOM”) of the two share classes and the PECs. DLOM was
determined using the Finnerty approach.

The parameters used in calculation are as follows.

The fair values of benefits granted to employees at the inception of the program were as follows:
ordinary shares 3.25 Euro, preferred shares 0.00 Euro and PECs 0.00 Euro.

The weighted average of grant date fair values for the instruments granted to employees in the
financial year amounted to 0.19 Euro for ordinary shares (prior year: 0.55 Euro), 0.00 Euro for preferred shares
(prior year: 0.00 Euro) and 0.00 Euro for PECs (prior year: 0.00 Euro).

###### Independent Auditor’s Report

_Note: The following “Independent Auditor’s Report” in accordance with par. 322 of German_
_Commercial Code (HGB) relates to the Consolidated Financial Statements as described above, together with the_
_Group Management Report of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the financial year from October 1, 2018 to_
_September 30, 2019. The Group Management Report is not part of the information, which is issued as part of_
_this online publication with the Auditor’s Report. The enclosed wording is a translation of the German original._

Independent Auditor’s Report

To Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf

_Opinions_

We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of Kirk Beauty One GmbH, Düsseldorf, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at September 30,
2019, the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, the Consolidated Reconciliation from Profit or Loss to Total
Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Changes in Group Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the financial year from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, and the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the
Group Management Report of Kirk Beauty One GmbH for the financial year from October 1, 2018 to
September 30, 2019.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

— the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements comply, in all material respects, with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at September 30, 2019, and the profit or loss for the financial
year from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, and

— the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group’s position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the
Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements and presents the
opportunities and risks of future development appropriately.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any objections
relating to the legal compliance of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report.

_Basis for the Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management
Report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the German Generally Accepted Standards of Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany]
(IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the section
“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report” of our auditor’s report. We are independent from the group entities in accordance with
the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and on the Group Management Report.

_Other Information_

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information in the Financial Report, which is published in English language, with the exception of the audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and Group Management Report and our auditor’s report.

Our opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

F-142


-----

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

— is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the Group
Management Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

— otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management_
_Report_

Management is responsible for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that comply,
in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the Consolidated Financial Statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and
profit or loss of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal controls as they have
determined necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the
accounting principle of “going concern” unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that,
as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position, is, in all material respects, consistent with the
Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements, and presents the opportunities
and risks of future development appropriately. In addition, management is responsible for such precautions
and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Group Management
Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide
sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the Group Management Report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group_
_Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial
Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the
group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and presents the opportunities and risks of future development
appropriately, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and on the Group Management Report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with the German Generally Accepted Standards of
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these Consolidated Financial Statements and this Group Management Report.

We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We
also:

— identify and assess the risks of material misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements
and in the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls.

— obtain an understanding of internal control system relevant to the audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and of precautions and measures relevant to the audit of the Group
Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these
systems.

F-143


-----

— evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the
reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.

— conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the accounting principle of “going
concern” and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Group Management Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

— evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements
present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and the profit or
loss of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.

— obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the Consolidated Financial
Statements and on the Group Management Report. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our
opinions.

— evaluate the consistency of the Group Management Report with the Consolidated Financial
Statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

— perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the
Group Management Report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate,
in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and
underlaying assumptions. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We discuss with those charged with governance, among other matters, the planned scope and the
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control system
that we identify during our audit.
