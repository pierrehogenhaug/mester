The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein have limitations as analytical tools, including the following: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts; - although depreciation, amortization and impairments are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized and impaired will often need to be replaced in the future, and the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating the relevant non-GAAP financial measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; - other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as a comparative measure; and - they remove the results of impairments and disposals of fixed assets which may also occur in future periods. In addition, certain summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial data of the Group has been prepared to give effect to the Refinancing Transactions (as defined herein).

The summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information presented below includes non-GAAP measures and is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual amounts. xxii ----- Such summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial measures are: - Adjusted Cash in bank, which we define as cash of €104.7 million as of March 31, 2024, adjusted to give effect to (i) the Refinancing Transactions and (ii) the payment of cash consideration in an amount of €33.5 million (equivalent) in connection with the Britannia Acquisition (which was completed on June 4, 2024 and was funded using cash on balance sheet); - Adjusted Gross Debt, which we define as the aggregate principal amount of our third-party financial indebtedness as of March 31, 2024 (excluding our financial leases which are long-term property leases that are classified as financial leases for the purposes of Dutch GAAP, but as to which there is no option or obligation to purchase the asset at the conclusion of the lease), on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions. Total financial debt as presented under “Capitalization” also excludes our financial lease obligations; - Adjusted Net Debt, which we define as the aggregate principal amount of Adjusted Gross Debt less Adjusted Cash in bank; and - Adjusted Interest Expense, which we define as the interest expense of the third-party financial indebtedness of the Group following the Refinancing Transactions, including the issuance of the New Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if the Refinancing Transactions occurred on April 1, 2023, and excluding (i) any interest expense with respect to other indebtedness of the Group which has since been extinguished and (ii) any interest expense with respect to shareholder loans. Furthermore, Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA has been prepared for illustrative purposes to give effect to the Pro _Forma Transactions as if such transactions had occurred on April 1, 2023. This information does not purport to_ represent what the actual consolidated financial position or financial information of the Group would have been had the Pro Forma Transactions actually occurred on April 1, 2023, nor does Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position and financial information at any future date or for any future period. Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual amounts. We define _Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA as Underlying EBITDA adjusted for the_ _Pro Forma Transactions as if such transactions had occurred on April 1, 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, _Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA does not reflect adjustments for expiring contracts and the addition of new contracts which are ordinary course operations for our business.

We mainly operate off-street parking spaces owned by us as well as parking spaces under concessions and longterm leases from public and private landlords, with a focus on off-street purpose-built parking facilities at strategic locations. We operate 4,315 parking facilities comprising 896,187 parking spaces as of March 31, 2024 in The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland. As of March 31, 2024, our long-term business portfolio included 64 legally owned facilities, 66 ground lease facilities and five protected lease facilities, 187 concession facilities and 402 long-term lease facilities, which together comprised over 320,000 parking spaces. As of March 31, 2024, our short-term business comprised 3,591 facilities and over 576,000 parking spaces. Based on a third party consultant report, we are a top three player as of December 31, 2023, based on off-street parking revenue, in all of the countries in which we operate.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Underlying Gross Margin[1] by Geography Underlying Gross Margin[1] by Contract Type,9.2.1,,"1 Underlying Gross Margin excludes non-allocated and central operating costs. 2 Includes short-term leases, control fees and management contracts. 1 ----- For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Underlying Total Revenue was €852.5 million, our Underlying Gross Margin was €287.7 million and our Underlying EBITDA was €235.5 million. Our operations in The Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom, respectively, represented 34.5%, 20.6% and 15.4% of our Underlying Total Revenue, 39.2%, 28.1% and 6.7% of our Underlying Gross Margin and 43.0%, 30.5% and 6.6% of our Underlying EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We started our operations in the European market in The Netherlands in 1998, and expanded to Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom in the early 2000s. We have consistently secured long-term contracts and built a portfolio of prime parking locations in The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Belgium and Germany, including multi-functional parking facilities near inner-city areas, public transport interchanges, airports and hospitals. Multi-functional parking facilities serve multiple urban needs (such as city centers, shopping centers, hospitals and railway stations). Due to a variety of physical, regulatory and other constraints such as cost and availability of space, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from a degree of captive demand with limited competition in some areas. We generate revenues under the following main business lines: - _Parking revenues. Our off-street parking business primarily comprises parking facilities owned and operated by us or operated by us under contract (both short-term parking and long-term parking). We have a healthy mix of short- and long-term parking customers. Short-term parking includes shorter term parking customers, such as per-hour or per-day tickets. Short-term parking generated 75.5% of our Underlying Parking Revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Long-term parking includes customers holding season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets. Long-term parking generated 24.5%% of our Underlying Parking Revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Short-term parking customers provide immediate payment in cash or by debit or credit cards at the gates and physical barriers present in our parking facilities, while long-term parking customers provide revenue stability and advance payments. Underlying Parking Revenues represented 87.5% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We generally retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility. In respect of parking facilities owned by us, we are responsible for all expenses relating to the parking facility, including operation, maintenance and management. Under our concession and lease contracts, we are responsible for all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during the term of the concession or the lease. - _Non-parking revenues. o _Control fees. Control fees are predominantly generated in Denmark and represent income arising from enforcement of paid parking (for example, parking fines) in parking facilities (usually above ground) owned by the Group and/or by landlords. Landlords generally contract with parking facility operators like us to eliminate or reduce the misuse of parking spaces (for example, misuse of handicap spaces, parking on rescue roads, misuse of reserved parking spaces and long-term parking in spaces intended for short-term parking). Underlying Control Fees represented 3.0% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _Management fees. Our management fees business represents the fixed and variable fees we receive for operating parking facilities under contracts with third parties including public authorities as well as private landlords and other private entities. Our Underlying Management Fees represented 5.6% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _Rental income. In addition to owning, operating and managing parking facilities, we lease certain of our owned parking facilities to the municipality of Amsterdam. Rental income also includes the income from the lease of parts of our facilities to third parties that use the space for parking, storage or to provide spaces used for business operations, such as refrigeration or storage facilities for restaurants. Our Underlying Rental Income represented 1.8% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _EV charging fees. We launched the EV Charging Program in May 2022 to substantially increase the number of EV charging points in our owned and long-leased parking facilities by the end of 2024. We earn fees from our customers who use the EV charging points provided at our parking facilities. 2 ----- Our Underlying EV Charging Fees represented 0.8% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _Other revenues. Other revenues include all other revenues not included in the categories above, such as subsidies, ancillary revenues, revenue from other alternative uses of our parking facilities and other services such as vending machines placed in our parking facilities.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strengths,9.3.1,Large and Growing Market with Strong Fundamentals,"The off-street parking industry in Western Europe is highly fragmented with a limited number of large players. Accordingly, leading parking infrastructure players like us are better positioned than smaller operators to take advantage of positive industry dynamics and benefit from the resilience and maturity of the market. Our operations are supported by a growing customer base, well-established presence and favorable pricing dynamics. As an established market player, we have consistently grown our total revenue for the past 25 years (other than in 2020, when our revenues were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic). The European countries in which we operate have also seen continued growth in light vehicle fleet which, according to GlobalData, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.5% over the next decade. Personal cars (excluding ride hailing and taxis) are also expected to remain the most popular form of transport, accounting for 45% of trips worldwide, ahead of public transport, ride hailing and other mobility modes, according to The Future of Mobility, McKinsey Quarterly Report, published in April 2023. In addition, we believe that upfront costs and regulatory requirements (including obtaining planning permissions to build new high density parking facilities, complying with regulatory frameworks governing parking concessions and navigating contracts with municipalities) and the economies of scale that result from operating multiple facilities across multiple geographies present significant challenges for new entrants in the car parking industry in Western Europe. In addition, our long-standing relationship with municipalities enables an ongoing dialogue with public sector players, allowing us to be a key counterpart in discussions to improve local and regional mobility solutions. This provides us with opportunities to expand our existing business with such municipalities, and we are well positioned to handle their requirements. Although our volumes (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) across the broader transport sector were negatively impacted by the mobility restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022, car traffic (and closely linked to it, toll road traffic) has experienced the fastest pace of recovery among the broader transport sector. As of December 31, 2023, our LFL short term parking volumes (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) have recovered to approximately 102% of 2019 levels, while air cargo remains below 2019 levels. A similar recovery in volume has also been experienced across other parking operators in Western Europe, demonstrating the structural resilience of the broader parking sector and a proven ability to recover from industry disruption at a faster pace compared to other traffic-exposed asset classes. Further, we believe that the parking sector is expected to benefit from key trends in the industry, including, for example, (i) the regulatory shift away from on-street parking with reduced on-street parking provisions in low emission zones and/or in densely populated cities, (ii) increasing priority given to pedestrians, cyclists and various forms of shared mobility (including car sharing and public transport) as cities and municipalities increase their sustainability focus, (iii) change in consumer dynamics to focus more on experiences and (iv) carbon neutrality and “green city” goals of various jurisdictions. The increased focus on electrifying the car fleet to meet “green city” objectives is expected to drive the penetration of EVs in Europe from approximately 1% in 2020 to approximately 18% by 2030. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends given our (i) continued focus on off-street parking, (ii) strategically located parking assets to capture continued demand, (iii) our highly developed technology platform that provides a digital parking ecosystem and seamless customer 3 ----- experience journey and (iv) the deployment of our EV Charging Program, which we launched in May 2022 to substantially increase the number of EV charging points (“CP”) in our owned and long-leased parking facilities to 5,500 by the end of 2024. As of December 31, 2023, our parking facilities offer 4,114 EV CPs, of which 2,996 are part of our “asset-heavy model,” whereby such EV CPs are owned by us but operated by third parties. We aim to profitably expand our EV charging business through an increasing number of EV CPs in our owned and longleased parking facilities in line with the continued increase in penetration of EVs in Europe.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strengths,9.3.2,Leading Off-Street Parking Infrastructure Owner and Operator in Western Europe with Local Scale and Diversified Portfolio of Value Creating Assets in Strategic Locations,"We are one of the leading off-street car park infrastructure owners and operators in the Western European parking market, with 4,315 parking facilities comprising 896,187 parking spaces as of March 31, 2024. Based on a third party consultant report, we have a top three market position as of December 31, 2023 in all of the Western European countries in which we operate based on off-street parking revenue. Our large footprint across our seven countries of operation allows us to build on a local scale in each of these markets. Our size and scale allows us to operate our car park portfolio efficiently, for example through sharing resources among our car parks (in particular, in clusters where we operate multiple parking facilities in close proximity), including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management resources in respect of accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. The number of our locations and the connectivity of our parking facilities through our digital capabilities and proprietary technology gives us a commercial advantage and enables us to anticipate customer needs across multiple locations. For example, our access to real-time transactional data on occupancy and availability of our parking facilities enables us to better anticipate and predict customer demand. In addition, due to our size and scale, we are better equipped to make significant investments in IT and to leverage such investments across our operations compared to smaller competitors. Between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2024, we invested approximately €32 million in Underlying ICT & Other Capex, which includes investments in enhancements of infrastructure and cyber security. Such operational efficiencies and cost savings generated through IT initiatives and investments allow us to offer attractive terms to municipalities and landlords and operate a differentiated pricing model. Finally, the size and diversity of our portfolio means that we have significant experience with different operating models, allowing us to adapt effectively and efficiently to different contract types and regulatory structures. Our market leading positions, size and growth have allowed us to achieve significant economies of scale, and the scope of our operations and the quality of our assets have supported the quick recovery of our Underlying Total Revenue following the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been able to achieve operational efficiencies and cost savings through the implementation of a streamlined and lean management and governance structure across our operations. Our economies of scale enable us to be a consolidation platform for European parking operations and allow us to undertake and quickly integrate valuable new concessions and acquisitions of smaller players, as well as individual assets and lease contracts. In addition, through our experienced management team, and due to our long-standing reputation in the industry, we have been able to develop and maintain important relationships with various municipalities and private landlords with whom we do business, thereby reducing our dependence on any single local governmental authority or region. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, no single contract represented more than 3% of our total Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) and no single city represented more than 11% of our Underlying Total Revenue or our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). We have strategically positioned our portfolio to focus on off-street parking in line with the regulatory shift in favor of off-street parking. Our off-street parking business and on-street parking business represented approximately 90% and 10%, respectively, of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Off-street parking contracts are typically longer duration contracts (generally more than 15 years) in comparison to on-street parking contracts (generally less than five years). This generates long-term cash flows with a balanced mix of short- and long-term parking customers. Short-term parking customers provide immediate payment, while long-term parking customers provide revenue stability and advance payments. Further, off-street parking is supported by the presence of physical barriers, which limits fee evasion, facilitates prompt payment and enables revenue stability. Our business benefits from a portfolio of parking facilities and parking spaces which is highly diversified in terms of number of contracts, type of contract, number of municipality clients, number of private landlords and types of parking services we deliver. We operate across seven countries in Western Europe which have attractive and mature parking market dynamics at the inflection point for growth through digitization and electrification. As of March 31, 2024, we had a total of 380,701 parking spaces in The Netherlands, 131,957 parking spaces in France, 4 ----- 46,124 parking spaces in the United Kingdom, 82,672 parking spaces in Germany, 181,916 parking spaces in Denmark, 55,824 parking spaces in Belgium and 16,993 parking spaces in Ireland. Below is a chart that presents the breakdown of our Underlying Total Revenue by country for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strengths,9.3.3,,"We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Western Europe, including our local market leadership positions, high quality real estate portfolio, long-term cash flow visibility, resilient and diversified business profile, strong asset locations and a scalable platform with tangible growth opportunities across our core parking business, digitalization, EV charging and mobility solutions. As a result of these strengths, together with the key infrastructure features that underpin our business model and the continuing regulatory shift in favor of off-street parking, our business benefits from a high level of stable and recurring cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Underlying Revenue per country,9.4.1,Robust and Stable Financial Profile with Long Term Historical Track Record and Predictable Cash Flows Underpinned by Real Asset Ownership and Long-Term Contracts,"For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) was generated by our long-term business. We benefit from long-term visibility of cash flows, and the correlation of parking demand to the total size of the car fleet (rather than GDP) enhances the stability of our revenues over long periods and helps ensure resilience through periods of economic downturn. We have demonstrated consistent revenue growth over the past 25 years (other than during the period impacted by COVID-19), with a strong recovery following the impact of COVID-19. Although our business was negatively impacted during 2020 and 2021 as a result of mobility restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our Underlying Total Revenue has recovered to above 2019 levels, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, has grown at a CAGR of 4.2% since 2017. The decrease in our Underlying Total Revenue in 2020 and marginal increase in 2021 was primarily driven by increased volatility in Underlying Short-Term Parking Revenue, which dropped immediately in response to COVID-19 restrictions, while Underlying LongTerm Parking Revenue remained relatively stable over the period. Our performance has consistently improved independent from economic cycles, with an average Underlying Likefor-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate of 4.5% over the period from January 1, 2014 through March 31, 2024, compared to a real gross domestic product (“GDP”) average growth rate of 1.8% and consumer price index (“CPI”) annual inflation of 2.1% during the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Underlying Revenue per country,9.4.2,,"Within these countries, our portfolio is spread across approximately 352 cities with no significant exposure to one city. Our top city (Amsterdam, with 31 parking facilities as of March 31, 2024) represented approximately 11% of our Underlying Total Revenue with our top 20 cities representing approximately 54% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Across these cities, we operate a tailored approach with the type of contract tailored to the country of operations. Our business primarily comprises (i) legally owned properties, (ii) long-term leases, (iii) concessions, (iv) ground leases, (v) protected leases and (vi) short-term leases. As such, we have a portfolio consisting of both parking facilities owned and operated by us as well as those operated by us under contracts (both long-term and short-term), as well as ancillary services such as our control fee business. As of March 31, 2024, our long-term business portfolio included 64 legally owned facilities, 66 ground lease facilities and five protected lease facilities, 187 concession facilities and 402 long-term lease facilities, which together comprised over 320,000 parking spaces and accounted for approximately 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, our short-term business comprised 3,591 facilities and over 576,000 parking spaces and accounted for approximately 10.4% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our parking business is also diversified in terms of location (inner city centers, hospitals, shopping areas and transport links). We believe our limited reliance on any single parking facility is a significant factor in diversifying our source of revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. Our parking facilities are typically not dedicated to a single institution or purpose and are mostly multi-functional, meaning they are used by drivers that may be using the car park to visit different locations, whether it is for work, shopping, cultural activities, or other purposes. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, 70% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) was generated by multi-functional facilities. We believe that we enjoy a prime position in the relevant local area with respect to a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Our prime locations, the multi-functionality of our car parks and the challenges in building new car parks help mitigate competition risk in our business. Further, our multi-functional car parking facilities also have alternative uses and can potentially be a source of ancillary revenues (for example, as storage facilities or refrigeration for restaurants, car rental, car sharing, bike parking, or as a last mile delivery hub). The remaining 30% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 was generated by mono-functional facilities, which are selected on a strategic basis with the aim of ensuring stability of demand. We generally target regional and/or national partnerships (for example, operating Park + Ride solutions for the Dutch railways (NS)) with municipalities and local authorities and/or transport hubs. Our parking business is also diversified in terms of our end users. We process over 100 million transactions annually across both short-term and long-term parking. This gives us access and exposure to and insight into the behavior of a highly diversified customer base. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our short-term 5 ----- parking business represented 66.1% of our Underlying Total Revenue from more than 81.5 million transactions. Our typical short-term parking customer pays for transactions on a per-hour or per-day basis and typically stays at our facilities for an average of two to four hours per transaction. These customers are largely occasion-driven with predominantly low recurrence. On the other hand, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our longterm parking business represented 21.4% of our Underlying Total Revenue from more than 20.5 million individual single-stay transactions. Our typical long-term parking customer pays for the transaction in advance, usually with the purchase of a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual season ticket, and typically stays at our facilities for an average of eight to ten hours per transaction. These customers constitute our known loyal customer base and currently consist of more than 100,000 season ticket holders. The remaining 12.5% of our Underlying Total Revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 consists of management fees, control fees, rental income, EV charging fees and other income. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure companies, who typically rely on a smaller number of large contracts or concessions, or strong concentrations in a single geography, resulting in a greater concentration of risk.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,"Underlying Like-for-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate, compared to real GDP and CPI growth",9.5.1,,"Note: GDP and CPI for geographies Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands and United Kingdom. 1 Based on Euromonitor data. Country metrics are weighted by share of Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. 2 Based on percentage change from period to period in the Underlying Parking Revenues generated from parking facilities categorized as LFL operations. We define Underlying Like-for-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate as the as the percentage change from period to period in the Underlying Parking Revenues generated from parking facilities that we categorize as LFL operations. A parking facility is included in LFL operations: (a) until 2019, if it has an initial duration of five years or more and has operated for at least two full financial years, measured as of the beginning of the current financial year, and (ii) from and including 2020, if it has an initial duration of five years or more and has operated during the full reporting period from 2019 until the current reporting period, in each case, excluding any facilities which are due to expire in the current reporting period, facilities that are newly opened in the current reporting period and certain facilities that are not fully operational (for example, due to refurbishment). Given the foregoing, the number any identity of parking facilities making up our LFL operations up to and including the year ended December 31, 2019 is different from the number and identity of parking facilities making up our LFL operations from the year ended December 31, 2020 onward, so the periods are not fully comparable. Following COVID-19, volumes have recovered rapidly, and our total volume has been above 2019 levels since April 2023, despite price increases. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Underlying EBITDA was approximately 8% higher than pre-COVID-19 Underlying EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 6 ----- seasonality of our Underlying Total Revenue as of March 31, 2024 is also now consistent with pre-COVID-19 seasonality. See “Business—Parking Revenues.” Our cash flow generation benefits from an advantageous working capital cycle through the collection of upfront payments (through season tickets) from our long-term parking customers and revenue collection directly upon exit of the car park for our short-term parking customers. As a result of our low Underlying Existing Business Capex and Underlying ICT & Other Capex requirements, we have achieved Underlying FCF Cash Conversion Ratio of 74.6% and Underlying EBITDA Margin of 27.6% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe that our infrastructure portfolio is well invested. Our portfolio comprises a mix of legally owned assets, protected leases, ground leases, long-term leases, concessions, other short-term leases and other contracts (including management contracts, rental contracts and contracts in relation to our EV charging business). Below is a chart that presents the breakdown of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) by contract type for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Underlying Gross Margin[1] by Contract Type,9.6.1,Scalable Platform Well Positioned for Sustainable Growth,"The scale in our countries of operation provides us a platform to grow the business (both organically and inorganically) in a sustainable and intentional manner while positioning ourselves to take advantage of the positive trends in digitization and EV charging infrastructure. We benefit from an industry where demand is relatively inelastic to price, although specific contractual arrangements may limit pricing flexibility. We believe that consumer choice regarding parking is not primarily driven by price but by factors such as location and distance to destination, parking availability, security, payment type and more recently, the availability of EV charging points. In addition to this, by virtue of the type of contracts we have entered, approximately 67% of our portfolio benefits from inflation protection either through full discretion on prices or through contractually agreed inflation-linked protection and we have partial flexibility in respect of the remaining 33% of our portfolio as of March 31, 2024. This combined with our scale and leadership position affords us “pricing power,” which provides us freedom to introduce price increases in line with or ahead of inflation, as illustrated by the charts below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

We have long-term cash flow profile visibility with 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding nonallocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 comprising primarily facilities that are owned or operated under our long-term business, of which 83% are entitled to operate until at least 2033 (assuming no renewals, new business or price indexation), as illustrated by the following chart. 1 Underlying Gross Margin excludes non-allocated and central operating costs. 2 Based on Underlying Gross Margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, excluding non-allocated and central operating costs. As of March 31, 2024, the Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our long-term contracts was approximately 47 years. Furthermore, our portfolio is backed by significant real asset ownership. As of March 31, 2024, the 7 ----- market value of our real estate portfolio, predominantly located in large and attractive cities, was €1.8 billion. The portfolio comprises 123 properties consisting of legally owned and ground leases. Such market value has been prepared without comprehensive due diligence or the benefit of an inspection of all of the properties. We believe that our strategic focus on owned facilities and long-term contracts has resulted in a stable business model, which enables us to attract customers and is supported by the high volume of cars and growing urbanization where our parking facilities are located. These prime locations provide flexibility and stability to our business, combined with stability of demand, leading to revenue stability as evidenced by the historical evolution of our revenues over time. In certain circumstances (primarily in relation to concessions in France), the long-term contracts and concessions include a protection mechanism allowing renegotiation of payments to local municipalities in case a certain level of performance is not achieved, thereby providing protection in case of lower demand. Further, in respect of our ground leases, there is typically a protection mechanism where the municipality is required to pay compensation to us in the event the municipality intends to terminate the ground lease or expropriate the property, thereby providing us adequate security and stability. Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure assets, including long-term cash flow visibility, physical and high value assets, central role in the local economy, proximity to public sector players, embedded hedge against inflation, limited correlation to economic cycles, resilient revenue generation, and a favorable and stable regulatory environment with certain protections for us in the event of regulatory or administrative changes. Unlike some other infrastructure companies, our parking facilities, once operational, require relatively low levels of Underlying Existing Business Capex. Our limited Underlying Existing Business Capex, which averaged 5.0% of Underlying Total Revenue across the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, are driven by our scale and preventive maintenance measures. Underlying Existing Business Capex relates to the upkeep of our existing facilities as well as repairs to our facilities to ensure they remain fully operational and compliant in line with our internal quality standards. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from returns on these investments without the need to incur significant Underlying Existing Business Capex with respect to these facilities. Our relatively low Underlying Existing Business Capex requirement allows us to focus on investment in other key areas of growth and portfolio investments, including portfolio expansion and new business, information and communications technology (“ICT”), digital solutions, CO2 reduction and new growth areas such as EV charging infrastructure.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Despite these price increases, our volumes (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) have continued to recover in 2023 and 2024 with our LFL short term parking volumes (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) surpassing pre-COVID-19 levels in the second quarter of 2023 and the positive trend continuing into the third quarter of 2023. Our season ticket volumes were fairly stable throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with the lowest point in the period, from January 2020 to September 2022, being approximately 6% below January 2020, which was immediately prior to the impact of COVID-19.

Our senior management team has consistently outperformed budget targets and has a strong track record of strategy execution, which can also be attributed to the senior management team’s ability to anticipate and embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector. This has enabled us to be a pioneer in the deployment of efficient transformational programs, revenue management and digitalization programs, user friendly applications, such as PaSS, and sustainability initiatives, such as our EV Charging Program. Our senior management team has also shown its capability in successful portfolio management with the constant delivery of new contracts and active acquisition activity, with 68 signed deals (seven acquisitions and 61 asset deals) since 2021. In addition, our local management teams are well-connected to industry bodies and groups as well as local municipalities and maintain strong and long-standing local relationships with the relevant regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our regional management teams also have extensive sector experience. Our regional teams comprise senior people having local presence, some of whom also hold prestigious positions with local municipalities and regulatory authorities. We believe that our parking facilities are an essential part of the urban mobility infrastructure and thus part of our contribution to the transition to zero-emission mobility. We have been contributing to sustainable mobility for many years, and have been reporting annually on sustainability, based on the GRI Standards, since 2011. While our early sustainability efforts were focused on raising awareness and integrating sustainable development in our day-to-day business, since 2017 we have shifted our focus to developing and implementing shared solutions, including through identifying how we can contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and our role in helping society progress toward Europe’s aim to be climate neutral by 2050. Our sustainability commitments are focused on key areas that have been identified as most relevant to our stakeholders, including sustainable mobility, digitization, electrification, energy consumption and liveability. Promoting sustainable mobility is central to our efforts, and we believe that our focus on off-street parking supports this goal in a number of ways. 225 of our parking facilities were located near public transport hubs as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.3% since December 31, 2022, enabling our customers to take advantage of alternative lower-emission forms of transport. As of December 31, 2023, 506 of our parking facilities offered online pre-booking, which reduces the amount of traffic caused by motorists circling city streets searching for a place to park. The increase in the availability of pre-booking solutions has been driven by our focus on digitization, primarily through PaSS, which has also enabled us to process customer information more efficiently and improved our informed decision-making capabilities.. In line with the increasing penetration of EVs in Europe, we have also significantly increased the number of EV charging points in our parking facilities, from 2,114 as of December 31, 2021 to 4,114 charging points as of December 31, 2023. In addition to supporting the shift to more sustainable mobility in the communities in which we operate, we have also improved our own performance on ESG metrics, particularly with respect to energy consumption and our overall carbon footprint. As of December 31, 2023 the total energy consumed in our parking facilities has decreased by 12.7% since the year ended December 31, 2021. Our efforts to reduce our energy consumption and to source more green energy has led to a decrease in our average carbon footprint per parking space in owned and long-leased parking facilities from 179.1 kg of CO2 in the year ended December 31, 2010 to 45.4 kg of CO2 as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 74.6%.

From January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2024, we signed a total of 61 asset deals for parking facilities for new business including for the operation of facilities) consisting of 38 new operating contracts for parking facilities and 23 negotiated contract renewals for parking facilities, as well as seven bolt-on acquisitions of parking facilities, contributing approximately €40.3 million in “run-rate” EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, which represents the EBITDA generated from all new contracts signed during the relevant period, assuming that each new contract is being performed at its full maturity potential assessed by us at the time of signing of such contract on the basis that (i) all parking spaces under each contract will be made available during the relevant period, (ii) all revenue generating functions of our business have been realized and (iii) the customary ramp-up period has passed. The 61 new asset deals and seven bolt-on acquisitions have an average contract duration of approximately 18 years and have an average period to recover the costs from the “run-rate” EBITDA of such assets of approximately five years. Since January 1, 2023, we completed four key transactions (“Recent Transactions”): - the Britannia Acquisition, pursuant to which Q-Park UK Limited acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Britannia Parking Group Limited, a parking operator in the United Kingdom, which was completed on June 4, 2024 and was funded using cash on balance sheet; - the Amsterdam City Tender, relating to the public tender by the City of Amsterdam that was awarded to Q-Park Operations Netherlands B.V. on August 14, 2023 pursuant to which Q-Park Operations Netherlands B.V. provides on-street parking services for approximately 160,000 parking spaces and will provide on-street parking services for up to 262,000 parking spaces in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and related services such as transactions, enforcement, permits and parking meters, for a period of eight years commencing January 1, 2024; - the Denmark Acquisition, pursuant to which Q-Park Operations Denmark A/S acquired City Parkeringsservice A/S, a Danish parking operator and control fee business in Denmark, completed on October 4, 2023; and - the Tazbell Acquisition, pursuant to which Q-Park Ireland Ltd. acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tazbell Services Group DAC, parent company of the Irish parking operator, Park Rite, completed on August 31, 2023. We estimate that these Recent Transactions collectively would contribute approximately €10.3 million to our Pro _Forma Underlying EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024._ Alongside our portfolio expansion, we have invested in the growth of our digital parking ecosystem, PaSS (Parking as a Smart Service), which allows us to offer increased convenience and certainty and a seamless customer experience. As of December 31, 2023, 75% of our parking facilities were PaSS-enabled (excluding management contracts and stalling garages) and 9% of LFL operations were processed through PaSS. PaSS provides us with the opportunity to differentiate online and offline parking tariffs, supporting product diversification and optimization of capacity. Across our digital platform, we focus on pre-booking revenues in event-driven areas with high and stable demand (such as airports, hotels, cruise terminals and event centers) and revenues from repeat short-term parking customers who increasingly value a seamless customer experience. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our digital revenues (calculated as revenues from (i) customers prebooking through our services as well as third party services, (ii) the Q-Park App and (iii) customers pre-booking parking at our airport facilities in the UK and Germany) were €83 million. Our digital revenues increased by 55% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 and by 40% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. We have also invested in expanding our business lines to take advantage of recent trends in the parking sector in order to generate incremental revenues. A key focus in this area has been the development of our EV Charging Program, which we launched in May 2022 to profitably expand our EV charging business through an increasing number of EV charging points in our owned and long-leased parking facilities in line with the growing demand for a publicly available charging infrastructure in our markets in Western Europe. As of December 31, 2023, we had 4,114 EV charging points across our parking facilities, which we estimate have enabled 63.7 million CO2free kilometers of driving for our customers since June 30, 2022. Adding EV charging points to our existing infrastructure enables us to take advantage of the continued trend toward electrification of the car fleet while 10 ----- requiring a low level of incremental investment and deploying capital at our own pace. As of March 31, 2024, we have invested approximately €12.9 million of capital expenditure in our EV Charging Program since 2022 and have realized a “run-rate” Underlying Gross Margin of approximately €4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We define “run-rate” Underlying Gross Margin as the annualized run-rate impact of EV charging volumes for the second half of the year ended December 31, 2023 (calculated on the basis of EV charging points installed capacity as of December 31, 2023) on the Underlying Gross Margin from our EV charging business for the year ended December 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Strategy,9.10.1,Maintain a Focus on our Diversified Portfolio and Profitable Assets in Strategic Locations,"We have a diversified portfolio of owned, leased and managed parking facilities, including concessions and contracts, in prime locations. Our infrastructure is well-invested, with a focus on the most attractive segments of the car parking market. We focus on smaller cities to benefit from their growth, and we will continue to seek to enhance profitability through portfolio optimization. We intend to focus our efforts on renewing our portfolio of existing contracts by maintaining our well invested assets to better manage future capital expenditure requirements and expanding our operations by capturing new opportunities that meet our stringent investment criteria. Due to our market leading position, scale and expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified portfolio by renewing our existing contracts and capturing new contracts in value-enhancing locations from both existing customers seeking to award new contracts and from other organizations looking to outsource the operation of their parking facilities. Our selection of facility locations is driven by our long-term strategy to operate and expand in high margin cities. Our highly diversified geographical coverage spans across approximately 352 cities that have attractive market dynamics, with a strategic and tailored approach to different markets in an effort to drive higher returns. We may also acquire high-quality smaller car parks in small- and medium-sized cities to further diversify our portfolio and benefit from the potential for growth in these cities. We believe that our balanced focus on smaller cities reduces our exposure to changing urban trends and regulatory changes in larger cities. Due to our scale, long-standing industry experience and established relationships with municipalities and private landlords, we are typically able to achieve significant synergies that also allow us to offer competitive terms and win new business. We will continue to grow our parking facilities in clusters representing multiple locations in strategic cities, which enhances our pricing strategy through a more resilient local competitive dynamic, operational cost reduction given our ability to have a single task force servicing multiple locations and strong relationships with municipalities. Our ability to build and maintain relationships with municipalities makes us well positioned to negotiate and win long-term contracts and to avoid long-term regulatory risk. We have clusters in key cities including The Hague, Amsterdam, Maastricht, Rotterdam, Toulouse, Chambery, Leeds, Manchester, London, Dublin, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Antwerp, Hasselt and Brussels. In addition, we are often able to expand our locations to further facilities once we have entered a local market by virtue of our existing relationship with local authorities and the ability to benefit from synergies with existing parking facilities. We believe our position as one of the leading owners and operators of parking facilities in Western Europe, combined with our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of local authorities and favorable industry dynamics, will assist us in continuing to implement this strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Strategy,9.10.2,Continue to Invest in a Differentiated Contract Offering with a Disciplined Investment Approach,"We believe that we are one of only a few infrastructure-based parking facilities operators in Europe that can offer the full spectrum of contracts, including ground leases, concessions, protected leases and long-term and shortterm leases. This offers us a high degree of adaptability to the most appropriate type of contract depending on the characteristics of each model and the demand in local markets. As of March 31, 2024, we had a diversified portfolio of 4,315 parking facilities in prime locations supporting stable and high demand, and 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) comprised long-term business, with the remaining 10.4% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) comprising short-term leases and other contracts and costs (including management contracts, rental contracts, contracts in relation to our EV charging business and leases with a duration of less than one year). Our other contracts typically have a fixed fee structure, which provides secured income visibility. This enables us to optimize and balance risk and return on our investment portfolio. Further, because our contract portfolio largely comprises long-term facilities (owned facilities, leased facilities (including long-term leases, ground leases and protected leases) and concessions), our Weighted Average Remaining Duration was approximately 47 years as of March 31, 2024, which provides a long-lasting cash flow profile. We also adopt a disciplined approach with respect to new investments and the expansion of our existing business. Our experienced Investment Committee (“IC”) reviews, appraises and assesses new investments. It reviews and advises on investment proposals from the country management teams with respect to potential new business (including the expansion of our existing business) and applies thorough and consistent criteria and analyses to provide a recommendation to the Executive Board to approve or reject the proposal.

Key features of our technology platform include digital invoicing, Park + Events capabilities, pre-booking for city parking, on-street parking, near-time parking information, Park + Fly capabilities, equipping facilities with PaSS gateways and Park + Charge capabilities enabled by the rollout of our EV Charging Program. This is expected to serve as a basis for long-term operations standardization and digitalization. Such digital capabilities seek to increase control and ownership over data, enable the use of standard interfaces to communicate with our partners and facilitate the integration of potential acquisitions or new sites. Our digital capabilities also allow us to capture customers earlier in their journeys, by facilitating pre-booking of parking spaces via the Q-Park App, and provide opportunities for connections with third parties, such as other mobility providers and end users. Our local scale and digital leadership enable us to manage pricing. We believe that our diversified portfolio and differentiated contract offering provides price flexibility and enables us to select the contracts that best suit our investment portfolio. We are able to use such pricing flexibility as a lever to maintain stability of cash flows and sustain profitability. As demand for parking is relatively inelastic to price, we have been able to successfully pass through more than 100% of the impacts of inflation to our customers since October 2021, with no negative impacts on volume (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities). Our data-driven pricing methodologies include measures such as differentiated pricing models (adaptation of prices based on demand and locations, such as peak hours, and online price differentiation with pre-booking), flexible pricing depending on frequency and duration, location-based pricing (such as premium pricing in city centers, medium-range pricing in Park + Walk locations and budget pricing in Park + Public Transport locations) and day tariffs optimization (through parking for over six or eight hours in strategic locations).

We have introduced several mobility solutions to enhance customer experience. For example, our PaSS initiative is built around a public cloud-based technology platform that allows us to interact with and provide services to our customers and business partners virtually. Integrated payment systems such as PaSS enable us to partner with companies like EasyPark, RingGo and 4411. See “Business—ICT and Operations.” We work closely with local authorities including in The Netherlands (Maastricht, Rotterdam and Eindhoven) and Belgium (Antwerp) to develop facilities that enable travelers to park their cars or bicycles close to transport hubs so our facilities act as vital links in the mobility chain, connecting travelers with their final destination and acting as public transport transit points. As of December 31, 2023, we had 225 owned and long-leased parking facilities registered at or near major transport hubs, an increase of 2.3% compared to December 31, 2022. We have also introduced Park + Ride and Park + Walk facilities in The Netherlands, which are modern, integral parts of the mobility chain in many towns and cities across The Netherlands and are located in the vicinity of public transport so they are easy to access and find. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2023, we have installed 4,114 EV charging points in our parking facilities, of which 2,996 are revenue-generating. We will continue to seek and explore initiatives to enable urbanization, particularly those which we believe will give us the first mover advantage in the market and sustain our position as drivers of industry change and leadership.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Strategy,9.10.5,Capture Sustainable Value with Actionable ESG Commitments,"Sustainability is a key part of our strategic framework, and we believe that we are well positioned to capture value from the energy transition, particularly with respect to the evolution of the EV market. According to the IEA Global EV Data Explorer published in April 2024, the share of EVs in Europe as a proportion of the overall car fleet is expected to increase from 1.1% in 2020 to 11.1% in 2030, equivalent to approximately 61.2 million EVs. We believe that our established customer base and broad, well-invested existing infrastructure portfolio makes us well-placed to capitalize on the increasing penetration of EVs, as adding EV charging points to our existing infrastructure requires a low level of incremental investment. Approximately 85% to 90% of the EV charging market is destination charging, with a particular focus on residential, workplace and retail charging, and our existing parking facilities already cover approximately 55% to 65% of the catchment area for this destination 13 ----- charging, primarily through proximity to workplaces and retail locations. We have already installed 4,114 EV charging points in our parking facilities as of December 31, 2023, and we plan to have 5,500 EV charging points by the end of 2024. Outside of the scope of EVs, we aim to continue to focus across our business on enhancing urban liveability and connecting communities by providing sustainable mobility solutions and seamless parking services. Within a broader framework of key sustainability topics, we have focused on the top five material topics of liveability and the mobility transition, energy, digitization and innovation, renovation and maintenance and climate change mitigation, and we are in the process of developing specific key performance indicators (“KPIs”) and targets around these topics, informed by the EU Green Deal and EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ESRS”). We intend to incorporate ESRS references into our CSR report, with the goal of being fully in compliance with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the “CSRD”) by 2025, which requires a double materiality threshold for reporting standards.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"Risks relating to our Business and Industry We operate parking facilities on certain properties legally owned by us and through ground leases, each of which face several risks, including the risk of expropriation by the government in the public interest.",13.1.1,,"As of March 31, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 64 parking facilities located on properties legally owned by us and 66 parking facilities operated through ground leases. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, 10.0% and 12.0% of our Underlying Total Revenue and 20.4% and 23.8% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) was generated from our legally owned parking facilities and facilities subject to ground leases, respectively. In relation to our legally owned properties, we face the risk of expropriation by the government in the public interest. In such circumstances, we are entitled to appropriate compensation from the government as specified under the relevant local laws. However, there can be no assurance that we will be paid sufficient compensation or at all. Further, in respect of our ground leases, while there is typically a protection mechanism whereby the municipality is required to pay compensation to us in the event that the municipality intends to terminate the ground lease or expropriate the property, we similarly cannot be certain that we will be able to recover such compensation. In the event of expropriation of one of our legally owned properties or properties subject to ground leases, failure to obtain sufficient compensation from the relevant authorities may result in loss of our investment as well as the parking facility which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, in such situations, we may also incur additional legal and other costs if we initiate legal action contesting the government’s decision to expropriate or the valuation of compensation. Additionally, our ground leases are for infinite or finite periods. Not all of our finite ground leases entitle us to receive compensation for the termination or expiration of such ground lease. If any such compensation were payable, amounts may vary across jurisdictions and may also be limited by the terms of the underlying ground lease. Our portfolio (mostly legally owned by us, but including, in some cases, certain ground lease properties), which had a property market value of €1.8 billion as of March 31, 2024, also faces risks related to reduction in value in any enforcement scenario, market fluctuations, encumbrances and legal action from third parties in the event of disputes relating to title and other property rights. In addition, such market value has been prepared without comprehensive due diligence or the benefit of an inspection of all of the properties. Further, while we believe that our asset-based model provides downside protection given our ability to convert legally owned facilities for alternative uses, given the specificity of our facilities, such alternative uses may require extensive and costly conversions, regulatory approvals or licenses or may not turn out to be profitable. If it is no longer profitable to operate a parking facility at one of the locations included in our portfolio of owned properties and we are not able to convert the space to an alternative use, we may not be able to recoup our investment in the facility which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Our lease contracts and concessions are granted for a limited period of time and are subject to termination by the granting authority under circumstances stipulated under public law or under the terms and conditions contractually agreed to.,13.2.1,,"As of March 31, 2024, we had 402 long-term leases and 187 concession agreements granted by municipalities and private entities. Our long-term leases are typically long-term arrangements with a Weighted Average Remaining Duration of approximately 22 years, and our long-term concession agreements are typically long-term arrangements with an average remaining duration of approximately 11 years, in each case, as of March 31, 2024. Moreover, while a majority of these contracts constitute long-term arrangements, some of our contracts will be subject to a public or private tender process at the end of their term. For example, since our bid for renewal of the Marseille Concession Agreement in a public tender process was not successful, the agreement terminated on June 2, 2024 in accordance with its terms. As of March 31, 2024, we operated 17 parking facilities in Marseille, France, five of which were operated pursuant to the Marseille Concession Agreement. Further, out of our top 10 contracts by Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs), none will expire in the next five years. The loss of, or the renewal on less commercially favorable terms of, a significant number of our existing facilities, or one or more of our largest facilities, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In France, insofar as the agreements take the form of concession agreements within the meaning of the French Public Procurement Code, car park concession agreements entered into with public authorities are governed by French administrative law. As such, the contracting public authority benefits from specific modification and termination rights provided under French administrative law. For instance, a change of shareholding of the concession holder may involve a prior information or authorization from the public authority (the ‘concédant’). Any breach in such a prior information or authorization may trigger the relevant authority’s right to terminate the concession agreement. The public authority benefits from specific rights departing from general rules of law (prérogatives de puissance publique) including a right to unilaterally modify or terminate any concession agreements, even if it is not expressly provided in the concession agreement. Such modification or termination will be decided based on serious contractor’s default (faute d’une gravité suffisante) or contractor default or public interest grounds (motifs d’intérêt général), which is subject to interpretation, each of which could result, for instance, from the change in the shareholding structure under certain circumstances (for example, a change creating a conflict of interest with the public authority). Generally, in the event of early termination of a lease or concession agreement where we are not at fault, we will be entitled to compensation from the public authorities for the amount of the investments we have made in carrying out the terms of the contract based on the degree to which the investments have been amortized (depending on the agreement’s provisions). We may also attempt to seek compensation under applicable law or under the relevant contract to cover the loss of profits for the remaining duration of the contract, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful. Additionally, public authorities generally have some discretion in interpreting the terms of these contracts, especially when determining whether we have complied with their terms. If we are unsuccessful in seeking compensation in the manner described above, our recourse would be to claim such compensation in court, which could involve additional expenses and, in any event, an extended period of time to reach a resolution. Finally, even if we are ultimately successful, the public authorities may not have the resources available to satisfy any claim by us for compensation for lost investment or profit on a timely basis. Additionally, certain of our contract management agreements allow the counterparty to remove some parking spaces from our management without compensation for public interest reasons. To the extent such rights are exercised, our rights to contest these actions may be limited. The modification or early termination by the relevant authorities of one or more of our lease or concession agreements or the early termination or reduction of one or more of our management contracts could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,"We are subject to competition that can constrain our ability to acquire new parking facilities and win and renew long-term parking lease contracts and concessions which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",13.3.1,,"The off-street parking sector in Western Europe is a competitive market, with a variety of competitors ranging from small, local single facility operators to large, regional, national and international operators with a significant number of parking spaces. While the largest owners or new entrants and operators of off-street parking in the industry are the municipalities, some of these larger competitors are also divisions of diversified global corporations with greater financial resources, lower cost bases than we have or more aggressive profitability thresholds. Consequently, they may be able to bid more competitively than we can in public tenders for 36 ----- concessions or may be able to offer more commercially favorable terms than us. As a result of such competition, we may not be able to win new concessions or renew existing concessions on commercially favorable terms or on terms consistent with those that we have negotiated in the past, or at all. In Western Europe, long-term parking lease contracts and concessions for parking facilities are generally awarded and renewed through competitive tenders. In the bidding phase of a parking facility, a significant number of competing bidders may participate. For example, in France, we face competition in the public tender process for our concessions. In certain other markets where a majority of our facilities are legally owned or subject to ground leases, we face competition from private companies in identifying and acquiring sites for new parking facilities. In addition, some public authorities may decide not to re-tender certain lease contracts or concessions upon their expiry or tender them on commercially less favorable terms as compared to those that we have received in the past. Further, there also may be significant competition to renew existing leases. This risk is more pronounced where the contract is with a public authority and where a bidding process is required as opposed to with a private landlord where we can initiate bilateral discussions ahead of upcoming lease expirations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,"Changing consumer behavior and changes in transportation and traffic patterns may lead to a decline in parking demand, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",13.4.1,,"A car parking service is an indirect service which depends on external factors, such as shopping centers, leisure amenities, hospitals, airports, offices, and housing, in the vicinity of a parking facility. New customer behavior, like online shopping and working from home, or changes in the popularity of certain stores or locations, poses a risk of a decreasing demand and, thus, may have an adverse effect on our business and revenue. Further, a variety of factors are contributing to changes in the transportation industry that could have a negative impact on our business, including changes in environmental and traffic control regulations, increased use of public transport by end customers and car sharing. Ride sharing services and alternative public or private transport providers, along with the development of autonomous vehicles and new sharing services with cars, scooters or bikes, trends that are particularly pronounced in larger cities, may lead to a decline in parking demand in cities and urban areas. While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyze and respond to consumer preferences and changes to consumer preferences and the markets in which we operate, consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. While we have invested in positioning ourselves to benefit from trends such as experience shopping and urbanization, these trends may turn out to be less resilient than expected, may decrease or reverse. Consumers may also increasingly drive less due to the convenience of online retail shopping and as a result of cities limiting cars or promoting other forms of transportation. Cities may increase regulations affecting price and availability of on-street car parking. For example, some cities may impose traffic congestion charges in urban areas, reduce the availability of on-street parking spaces, promote the use of public transportation in lieu of automobiles or limit automobile access in urban areas as has been the case in Amsterdam. Additionally, changes in consumer behavior, including increased use of mobile phone applications and on-line parking reservation services that help drivers reserve parking in garages, lots and from individual owners cannot be predicted with certainty and could change current customers’ parking preferences. Further, any change in consumer behavior or the driving pattern of our customers as a result of rising energy prices or inflation may change the demand for our parking facilities. Our efforts to respond to these changes in order to develop new sources of income by optimizing pricing and utilization may prove ineffective or our competitors may develop more efficient and popular solutions, which could result in us ceding market share and revenue to such competitors. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the consumer marketplace and the industry, including but not limited to changing preferences resulting from the proliferation of delivery service companies, car sharing companies and other new technologies, it could constrain our growth and have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,"General business and macro-economic conditions in the markets where we operate, including public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, may decrease demand for parking and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",13.5.1,,"Our business, financial condition and results of operations are affected by general business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased shortor long-term interest rates, high inflation, fluctuations in the availability or cost of funding, high unemployment rates, a weakened parking services industry, increased bankruptcy filings or a decline in the strength of national and local economies in which we operate and other factors that negatively affect our customers’ financial prospects could decrease demand for our services. These factors may in turn affect the mobility rates of our customers (for example, the number of people visiting public establishments for leisure activities such as shopping 37 ----- centers, restaurants, theatres and cinemas generally reduces during periods of increased inflation and economic downturn). For example, the global economy experienced one of its sharpest downturns in history as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the related lockdowns and other mobility restrictions. In order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, governments around the world implemented travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and self-isolations for infected people, business slowdowns or shutdowns, encouraging or requiring people to avoid large gatherings. Restrictions aimed at minimizing social contact and slowing down the spread of the virus varied from full lockdowns to closing retail stores, bars and restaurants. Furthermore, leisure activities and mass events were prohibited during such periods of lockdown. As a result, our short-term parking revenues declined as the direct amenities in the areas of our parking facilities were temporarily not available to people. Our results of operations, revenues and profitability were largely affected by the temporary closure of social activities and the restrictions imposed by government guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 2021 and the beginning of 2022. Moreover, the introduction and growing prevalence of remote working and other hybrid work arrangements for employees working in professional services also reduced the commute to business and financial districts in most cities and impacted the demand for our parking facilities. The strong COVID-19 vaccination momentum in 2021 positively impacted the market by enabling economies to open up faster, aiding the re-opening of some of our facilities and in the recovery of our operations. However, despite the recovery of the economy and our operations, our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition may continue to be affected by the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the markets in which we are active and the global economy, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Although some economies experienced a strong rebound in 2021 as restrictions eased, there is a material risk of a global recession coupled with high inflation. To counter inflation, central banks started increasing interest rates and they may continue to increase interest rates. Policy tightening in Western Europe and markets across the world is well felt in order to counteract rising inflation. If our costs continue to be impacted by significant inflationary pressures or interest rate increases, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. In addition, an extended period of increased commodity and services prices could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the rates of inflation in the markets in which we operate continue to increase, or if the funding markets or the economies in which we operate weaken, or if use of parking services decline, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect corporates’ financial prospects and customer behavior could lead to a decrease in demand for our parking facilities’ leases as well as the service prices and fees of the off-site parking we own or lease to our customers. Further, we own a considerable amount of property and goodwill. A deterioration of the general economic climate could result in a permanent reduction in the value of our assets, and if we are unable to identify, determine or communicate potential impairment indicators in a timely fashion, we may also incur reputational damage and financial loss. If we are not able to effectively mitigate or manage such risks, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,"Continuing economic or political instability and geopolitical conditions, including the conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip and Russia’s actions in Ukraine, higher energy costs and commodity prices and disruption in logistics chains, may negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.",13.6.1,,"Our results of operations are dependent on the economic and political conditions of the markets in which we operate, including the United Kingdom, France and Belgium (which for the three months ended March 31, 2024, collectively accounted for 40.4% of our Underlying Total Revenue), some of which have experienced economic declines recently, including in particular, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and during various periods in the past decade. Furthermore, our business is sensitive to reductions in consumer spending, which may be affected by negative economic and political conditions. Economic contraction, heightened inflation, economic and political uncertainty and the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in parking demand. Furthermore, there is political and social unrest in several regions and countries, amid the global threat of terrorism, which has increasingly targeted Europe and more recently, the Middle East region. The attacks in Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and the conflict that followed in the Gaza Strip has created an unstable geopolitical environment in the Middle East. Further, the continued military conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation which commenced on February 24, 2022 has resulted in certain sanctions being imposed by the United States, the EU, the UK and other jurisdictions (including the freezing of the assets related to Russian and Belarusian governments and individuals as well as excluding certain Russian financial institutions from the 38 ----- SWIFT messaging system), all of which have negatively impacted the European and global economy and financial markets. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, our portfolio of parking facilities has no direct exposure to Israel, the Gaza Strip, Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus and none of our properties are located in any of these markets. However, we cannot predict the impact of the rising conflict between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, or of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, and the heightened military conflict or geopolitical instability following therefrom, including heightened operating risks and production disruptions, terrorism, additional sanctions or counter-sanctions, economic instability, heightened inflation, market volatility, cyber disruptions or attacks, higher energy costs and commodity prices, higher manufacturing costs, disruptions in raw materials supplies, increased raw material costs, higher supply chain costs and disruption of logistic chains. In addition, following the commencement of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, a number of governments around the world have announced increased stages of sanctions. The lists of countries, regions, entities, organizations or persons subject to sanctions may continue to change over time, which may lead to contracts that were previously compliant with relevant sanctions regulations subsequently becoming non-compliant. In addition, ownership of organizations might change or control of regions might change, such that activities in regions that were previously compliant with relevant sanctions regulations might subsequently become non-compliant. Moreover, the rising tensions between Russia on one hand and the United States, United Kingdom and the EU on the other, particularly in relation to Russia’s actions in Ukraine and other geopolitical uncertainties (including escalating tensions in certain regions of the world) as well as volatility in commodity prices or a negative market reaction to central bank policies may affect the growth of the European economy and the countries in which we operate.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,"Disruptions and declines in the global economy and financial markets, including the European economy and financial markets, have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.",13.7.1,,"Our operations are located in Western Europe. Accordingly, our financial performance is particularly affected by economic and financial conditions in Europe, the overall stability of the eurozone and our results of operations may be adversely affected if difficult macroeconomic circumstances in Europe cause a sustained or significant decrease in the demand for parking services, or the pricing of parking services. Following the departure by the United Kingdom from the EU, which occurred on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), we operate in six countries that form part of the EU. As such, the EU is an important market for our business, and adverse economic effects within the EU could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Continuing instability in the European markets, the stability of the euro and the EU, heightened levels of inflation, the rise in interest rates, the continuing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the uncertainty resulting from refugee crises have all contributed to weaker European economic performance. Future developments may continue to be dependent upon a number of political and economic factors. Conditions in Europe have in turn resulted in increased volatility in global capital markets, which could continue for the foreseeable future. The increased volatility may result in a reduction in automobile travel of a discretionary nature, which could adversely impact traffic levels in a number of locations where we operate parking facilities. Economic and financial conditions in Europe and in the other principal markets in which we operate have a material effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The global economy and financial markets have experienced severe disruptions in the last decade. For example, following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the EU treaties ceased to apply to the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom left the EU. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, there were changes in the legal rights and obligations among commercial parties in the United Kingdom and the EU, including (among others) financial institutions, suppliers and service providers and their respective customers. In addition, there were changes in import, tax and employment laws and regulations after the end of the transition period, resulting in an increase in the cost of importing fixtures and equipment (and related technology) from EU countries and adversely affecting our and our contractors’ and supplier’s ability to retain and recruit employees from the wider European labor market, leading to labor shortages and higher costs. In addition, general elections in numerous EU countries could lead to the exit of one or more other countries from the eurozone or other potential developments, which could be an additional source of instability in international markets. Further, other EU member states within the eurozone could decide to discontinue their use of the euro as their functional currency. The exit of another country from the EU, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to this could result in significant macro-economic deterioration, including, but not limited to, decreases in global 39 ----- stock exchange indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the European Union. Any of these events or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could undermine confidence in the overall stability of the EU, have adverse consequences for us with respect to our overall performance in the EU and, as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

These expenses include fixed lease costs, business and real estate taxes, personnel costs, ICT costs, electricity costs, maintenance, cleaning and repair costs, security, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to decrease our costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our parking spaces decreases, the decline in our Underlying Total Revenue can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic). Where cost cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in Underlying Total Revenue, in particular in respect of our leased car parking facilities, we could experience a material decline in margins and potentially negative cash flows which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.10,The tariff rates that we can charge our customers are typically governed by our long-term contracts or concession agreements and/or certain laws.,13.10.1,,"The net turnover that we generate from our parking contracts is dependent on our tariff rates. The tariff structure is established under our relevant contracts and in some cases, we may have limited or no ability to independently raise tariffs beyond the agreed contractual provisions (usually, based on the rate of inflation or defined in a contractually agreed formula based on various indices, such as the cost-of-construction index and/or civil engineering indices). Before bidding for any project, we conduct an analysis to determine the conditions under which we believe such parking facility can be operated profitably. If the assumptions underlying our analysis prove to be incorrect and our tariffs do not generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs, we may be unable to increase our tariffs or reduce our costs in order for the parking facility to remain profitable, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. This effect could be compounded with respect to our long-term business given that our long-term leases are typically long-term arrangements with a Weighted Average Remaining Duration of approximately 22 years and our concession agreements are typically long-term arrangements with a Weighted Average Remaining Duration of approximately 11 years, in each case, as of March 31, 2024, and as a result, to the extent that our operations at the facilities subject to these long leases and concessions turn out to be less profitable than anticipated, the impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition would continue until the end of the contract term. We may seek to renegotiate tariffs under our contracts in certain extenuating circumstances but any agreement to increase tariffs remains subject to approval by the relevant landlord or municipality and may also be subject to a maximum increase in a given period. In any event, we cannot guarantee that such negotiations to increase tariffs with respect to our contracts will be successful in achieving the full increase sought or at all. In addition, in certain circumstances we may be required to adapt our pricing structures to comply with new regulations. As such, we are required to comply with certain rules and regulations with respect the amount we charge our customers which may limit the total amount charged and therefore impact our profitability from such operations. If the pricing structures at facilities we operate restrict us from profitably operating such facilities and we are unable to adjust them due to contractual or regulatory limitations, we could experience a material decline in the profitability of or a loss with respect to such facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 40 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.11,Changes in the legal and regulatory framework for the management and operation of parking facilities may impose significant costs on us.,13.11.1,,"The management and operation of parking spaces and facilities in Western Europe is highly regulated. The legal framework applicable to administrative leases and other agreements under which we operate parking facilities is subject to changes which could affect the profitability of our leases and agreements. We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations relating to our leases, some of which impose substantial financial and other penalties for non-compliance, including the revocation of the lease under certain circumstances. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of changes in the regulatory regime, which could potentially impose additional costs on our business or subject us to more onerous operating requirements, and thus have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes in environmental and traffic control regulations could reduce demand for, and volumes in, our off-street parking facilities that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. National or local governments could implement measures which are potentially unfavorable to the parking sector as a result of pressure from public opinion, pressure groups, or election results. For example, proposals relating to banning traffic within city boundaries or the introduction of bans on driving of diesel vehicles in certain cities could adversely affect inner-city parking, resulting in lower revenue, and diminished profitability. Further, a number of car parking spaces in Copenhagen are planned to be converted to flexible parking spaces for both bicycles and cars. The local authority in Copenhagen also introduced the “Cyclist Priority Plan for 2017-2025,” which seeks to encourage 50% of commuting journeys to be completed by bicycle. Similar measures have been proposed or enacted in other cities where we operate parking facilities. In addition, some municipalities may impose traffic congestion charges in urban areas, reduce the availability of on-street parking spaces or promote the use of public transportation in lieu of automobiles. Governments may also increase the tax levels on automobiles and petroleum for environmental reasons or introduce fees or other charges on driving in certain types of vehicles, which may reduce traffic. One example is the use of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (“ULEZ”) and the Low Emission Zone (“LEZ”) in the UK, which came into force in September 2020 and is enforced 24 hours a day every day of the year (except Christmas Day for the ULEZ). The ULEZ and LEZ require the payment of a daily charge by the owners of UK registered vehicles to drive within certain areas of London if the vehicle does not meet certain emission standards. Social perception and pressure relating to environmental concerns over the use of private cars may similarly adversely impact the demand for our facilities. Further, as of August 1, 2023, there is a designated parking zone in the historic center of Antwerp (Belgium) in which only residents with parking permits and certain permit holders (such as care providers, business owners and car sharers) are permitted to park on the street, resulting in lower on-street parking revenues. Furthermore, the government in certain cities may also reduce the tariffs of their parking facilities in order to compete with other cities and private companies. We may also be materially adversely affected by temporary or permanent changes to traffic routes or road closures, which may make it more difficult to access our parking facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event of significant regulatory changes that impact our contracts with municipalities, we may request the awarding authority in certain circumstances to modify the terms of the contract in order to restore the economic and financial balance of the relevant contract. However, we can give no assurance that such an adjustment would be available, that it would apply to all relevant agreements or that it would be on terms satisfactory to us or that it could be made in a timely manner. If such adjustments are not made or do not provide for sufficient or timely increases in our revenues in respect of the impacted contracts, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Even if such rebalancing is successful, it would not generally address all the losses we may have already incurred. Additionally, court proceedings to obtain an order for economic rebalancing of a contract may take a number of years to reach a conclusion and could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, regulatory action or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Moreover, regulators may impose heightened disclosure requirements concerning our operations or ESG-related matters, such as under the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) which was approved by the Council of the European Union on May 24, 2024 (thereby completing the adoption process) and which will require companies to demonstrate that they have taken all appropriate measures to effectively identify, inter alia, human rights, sustainability, work force management and governance risks and prevent, cease, mitigate, address or remediate actual and potential adverse impacts of their value chains. As a result, we may be required to incur additional operational costs in order to ensure compliance with such new regulations and any failure to adapt to regulatory changes may lead to penalties and reputational harm.

As a result, we may be required to initiate legal proceedings to claim amounts owed. These risks may be exacerbated by the impact of a future economic downturn in Western Europe, any further outbreak of prolonged pandemics or epidemic diseases and potential austerity measures imposed by the national governments. In the event that a municipality with whom we have a contract experiences financial difficulties, we are still obliged to continue providing services under our long-term contracts, regardless of outstanding revenues or compensation owed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

For example, in France, the opening of an insolvency or winding-up proceeding may not as such lead to the termination of the agreement, although insolvency could potentially result in other defaults which could in turn trigger termination of the contract, in which case such contracts will usually provide that no compensation is payable, except to the extent of the book value of the assets returned to the public authority (which may be compensated in whole or in part depending on the terms of the contract). In France, the public authorities who grant our concessions benefit from specific rights, including the ability to unilaterally terminate the agreement prior to the agreed term in the event of serious contractor’s default or for reasons of public interest, but also to unilaterally modify the provisions of such contracts in particular for reasons of public interest, subject to granting appropriate compensation (depending on the agreement’s provisions), as the case may be. In particular, early termination for public interest reasons, could give rise to the payment of financial compensation to the concession holder, including for the loss suffered and the loss of profits, but these amounts may not be sufficient to cover all loss of revenue over the life of such contract. Additionally, in certain cases, public authorities and other counterparties impose contractual restrictions on transfers of our rights, including change of control clauses, which prohibit the transfer of our rights without the relevant public authority’s prior approval. In the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the New Notes or the Guarantees that results in the transfer of ownership of the Issuer or any other Guarantor, or a change in the shareholding of the Issuer for other reasons, one or more relevant public authorities may argue that such an indirect transfer also requires their prior approval. As such, the local authority may attempt to terminate our contract if such change of control clauses exist in the relevant contract and such approval is not sought or granted. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such contracts itself could reduce the value placed on such contracts by third parties and ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action. In addition, direct assignments of certain leases or spaces are subject to the granting authority’s prior approval. Indirect assignments may also be subject to this requirement, depending on the specific contractual documents governing the arrangement and their interpretation by the relevant granting authority. Enforcement of the Collateral may also trigger requirements for approval of the relevant municipal councils. In France, a change in the concession holder’s shareholding structure can trigger the right for the public authority to validly terminate the agreement for reasons of public interest (intérêt _general).

We intend to continue to expand our business through acquisitions as well as organic growth. Our ability to expand our business will depend in part upon the availability of adequate capital, which in turn requires cash flow generated by our business and the availability of debt and equity financing. We finance our business activities with our own and borrowed capital. In response to increased levels of inflation in major economies around the world, central banks, such as the European Central Bank, the U.S. 45 ----- Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, raised interest rates or have signaled that they will or may raise interest rates in the future. For instance, in December 2021, the Bank of England voted to increase the base rate to 0.25% in the first increase since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, has steadily increased the base rate through 2022 and 2023, and most recently in August 2023 to 5.25%. Similarly, the European Central Bank raised its benchmark deposit rate on multiple occasions throughout 2022 and 2023, and most recently in September 2023 to 4.00%. A general, noticeable increase in interest rates could affect our ability to finance the acquisition, construction, operation or maintenance of our portfolio of parking facilities and other assets by debt capital and the general ability to refinance debt that becomes due. To the extent we use external debt financing at partially variable interest rates or when refinancing existing fixed rate indebtedness, an increase in interest rates would directly result in higher financing costs for us, including through higher costs for funding working capital requirements, requiring further cash outflow for our business. To control our interest rate risk we enter into hedging contracts in respect of a certain portion of our interest rate exposure. However, if any counterparty to these hedging contracts is unable to meet its obligations or if our hedging procedures turn out to be ineffective for other reasons, the interest expenses incurred by us could be higher than expected. Economic downturn in Western Europe, an overall rise of interest rates, the effects of a credit crisis and negative developments with respect to eurozone financial markets may have a negative impact on the availability and cost of bank or other financing. Furthermore, disruption to global capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A reduction in the ability of financial institutions or other credit institutions to provide financing could adversely affect our own ability to obtain credit and this may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, global financial markets have been recently adversely impacted by the collapse of certain financial institutions in the United States and in Europe, and the resulting mergers, reorganizations and regulatory actions in the banking sector generally. Such disruptions to global capital and credit markets may adversely impact our ability to raise capital and funding at an acceptable price, or at all. This may in turn adversely affect our costs, performance, financial position and flexibility. This may also affect our ability to repay debt and access capital and funding for growth or to make other capital expenditures. The lack of available debt on reasonable terms, or at all, could result in our inability to finance the acquisition, construction, operation or maintenance of our portfolio of parking facilities and other assets, or to refinance existing project finance facilities in relation to these facilities and assets, and may create a significant advantage for other competitors that have greater financial resources than we do.

Most recently, we launched our EV Charging Program in 2022 to substantially increase the number of EV charging points in our parking facilities. Early in 2022, we signed agreements with charge point operators for EV charging in our parking facilities across Europe. Our asset-heavy business model (whereby we own the EV charging point infrastructure, set the prices and receive all the revenues while the charge point operators install, operate and maintain EV charging points on a fee-basis) enables control on EV charging tariffs. See “Business—Non-Parking Revenues— _EV Charging Fees.”_ While we have been able to generate robust margins from EV charging fees since the launch of our EV Charging Program in 2022, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve current margins. With the increasing popularity of EVs, we anticipate increased competition and the need for pricing transparency in the EV charging business. Further, as part of our EV Charging Program, we may prioritize installing EV charging points in parking facilities where we believe we have a first-mover advantage or where we expect to generate higher margins. However, EV charging fees and margins currently generated from these initially targeted parking facilities may reduce over time and are not representative of the EV charging fees and margins we may be able to generate in the future across our entire portfolio, particularly with increased competition. Further, our EV charging margins are dependent on the effectiveness of energy procurement in a volatile energy market, caused by geopolitical circumstances as well as the energy transition towards renewables. Additionally, the roll-out of our EV Charging Program may be affected by regulatory requirements. For example, in France, we are required to provide at least one EV charging point for every 20 parking spaces available per parking facility by January 1, 2025. This translates to a rate of 5.0% of our total parking spaces in France that need to provide EV charging points, which is higher than the projected demand for EVs in France until 2025. As a result, our investment in installing EV charging points in France may not generate returns and margins at the same rate as some of the other countries in which we operate. The increased transparency in pricing may also affect our profitability. For 46 ----- example, under the European Union’s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation that came into effect on April 13, 2024, we are required to increase price transparency at our EV charging points by providing an ad hoc price and all components of our EV charging fees.

We are thus exposed to a number of risks associated with largescale construction projects, such as the failure of our contractors and subcontractors to perform, as well as delays and disruptions caused by technical or environmental problems, adverse weather conditions or other factors. Generally, pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreements, our contractors and subcontractors are required to indemnify us for delays in completing the project on time and any losses resulting therefrom. Further, under certain concession agreements where we agree to build the parking facility, we also agree with the municipality to indemnify us if they are responsible for any delays in construction. However, our losses may exceed the indemnification cap, the amount of the performance bond or the maximum loss coverage under these agreements, in which case we would not be adequately compensated for losses derived from construction delays. We may also be required to engage in costly litigation or arbitration proceedings in order to receive compensation under these agreements. Further, our ability to obtain compensation under our development contracts is dependent on the solvency of our contractors and subcontractors. Construction delays will also postpone the time at which the parking facility will be operational and therefore the time from which we will begin to receive revenues from the parking facility. Such delays could shorten the revenue-generating term of the facilities under contract with public or private entities and may entitle the granting authority to impose sanctions or terminate the contract, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Once the construction of a parking facility on a new site is completed, we are exposed to a variety of risks in connection with the opening and operation of the new facility, which could result in us failing to recover our investment in the new facility. For example, the actual demand for parking spaces at the new site may not meet our expectations, and we may experience lower than expected volumes and revenues. Further, there is an assimilation risk when a new parking facility is opened; the public must be made aware to be able to find it and use it, which means our ramp up time may exceed expectations, thereby reducing our volumes and revenues from those anticipated and budgeted at the time of construction.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Such disagreements are more likely to occur during periods of challenging economic conditions. For operations under contract, we are required to maintain the relevant infrastructure asset in satisfactory condition throughout the term of the contract, and upon the expiration of each agreement, to surrender substantially all assets related to such agreement to the relevant municipality or other third parties without financial compensation. If municipalities claim that we have failed to comply with the terms of our agreements, the contract may be revoked or we may not be successful in extending the agreement at the end of its term, or we may have to compensate the municipality as a result. Any such disputes or delays could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a governmental authority decides to terminate or amend our agreements due to a serious violation of our contractual or regulatory obligations, such as a failure to maintain the facility creating serious danger to users or a persistent failure to make payments to the awarding authority, we may not be entitled to full compensation for our initial investment or loss of anticipated profits. In addition, upon a serious breach of the terms of the space, the awarding authority could call due any performance bonds granted by us under the agreement, in which case we would be required to immediately repay any such performance bonds and indemnify the local authority for any damages claimed in excess of such performance bond amounts. In agreements entered into with private 47 ----- entities, breach of contractual obligations may also lead to the termination of such agreements.

Although we have regular maintenance policies and insurance in place, we may experience unforeseen problems such as, among other things, water damage, cracks in the walls or foundation or sinking. In addition, under the terms of certain of our agreements in respect of parking facilities that we do not legally own, we are responsible for maintenance and upkeep, including certain structural repairs. If we were to experience a significant problem requiring repairs, our maintenance costs may be higher than expected or we may be forced to suspend or reduce operations at the affected facility until such time as the issue is resolved. In addition, even if we are not liable for repairs, any incidents that require closure of our facilities may result in declined revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any safety concerns arising from unforeseen events or damage to our facilities may also cause reputational damage to our brand. For instance, on May 26, 2024, the ramps of the Q-Park St. Antonius Hospital parking garage in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands, one of the parking facilities owned by a third party and operated by us, collapsed. Although no injuries or casualties occurred, the parking facility has been temporarily closed to ensure the safety of our customers and employees. Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement, we are permitted to reduce lease payments in proportion to any restrictions imposed on the parking facility. Accordingly, since the parking facility is currently closed, we are not required to make any lease payments until the facility is reopened. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the cause of the incident and the extent of damage are still under investigation, and therefore, we are currently unable to assess the impact of this incident on our business and future prospects.

We currently have collective bargaining arrangements in place in The Netherlands, France, Belgium and Ireland. While we do not currently have collective bargaining agreements in place in certain jurisdictions in which we operate (such as in Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom), introducing such arrangements could result in a substantial increase in labor costs that we may be unable to recover through our existing contractual arrangements. Further, under applicable law, we have works councils in The Netherlands, France and Germany and we are required to seek their advice and consider any recommendations regarding certain business decisions we make from time to time and to obtain their approval for certain personnel measures. While we currently have good relationships with all works councils in these jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that disputes will not arise in the future. Additionally, we may incur expenses in resolving disputes and complying with local laws relating to overtime, social security and pension contributions, occupational risk matters and other labor related issues. We may also incur increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage, employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs or otherwise, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If we are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our 48 ----- competitors or within budgeted costs or on schedule when these systems become outdated or need replacing, or if we are unable to realize the intended benefits of any new information technology or other systems, our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, if we fail to keep up with technological advances in our industry, including advances to maintain or improve our cost-effectiveness or that add value to the services we can offer to customers, we may not be eligible to participate in or we may not win competitive tenders. Additionally, drivers increasingly use mobile phone applications and on-line parking reservation services that allow them to reserve parking at garages, lots and directly with individual owners. The popularity of such services cannot be predicted with certainty and could change our current customers’ parking preferences. As a result, we constantly upgrade our information technology to adapt to changing preferences, to keep up with market demand for new services and to match services offered by our competitors. Further, the introduction and popularity of electric cars requires investment in infrastructure, including technology infrastructure, such as charging points and plug-ins, which may lead to increased infrastructure and energy costs.

Natural disasters may also cause economic dislocations throughout an urban area, region or country. For example, due to severe floods in Germany in the summer of 2021, some of our parking facilities were unable to operate fully or at all for several months. In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in, and may continue to result in, heightened security and traffic control measures in urban areas and increased government regulation of airport facilities. For example, terrorist attacks in the major cities where we operate could have a negative impact on consumer travel and traffic levels in a number of locations where we operate parking facilities. We are also exposed to protests and riots, especially in large cities such as the Yellow Vests Protests in Paris and the Extinction Rebellion in London and in Den Haag, which could adversely impact the demand for our facilities and adversely affect our business or results of operations. The occurrence and consequences of such events are unpredictable, and further attacks, protests and riots could temporarily reduce traffic levels and decreased volumes for our parking facilities, and thus cause a reduction in revenues, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from such events. In addition, we are also exposed to various property offences and acts of vandalism, including those associated with drugs, suicides and homelessness, as well as incidents of violence against our staff (particularly control fee agents in Denmark and in our off-street parking facilities) and customers, which may adversely impact our operations, the safety of our employees or customers and cause significant damage to our employees, customers or facilities. Significant damage to or destruction of one of our facilities may also result in the termination of the contract, and we may be obligated to rebuild the facility without compensation where such damage is not covered by insurance or any insurance we have is inadequate to cover the full extent of damage done.

Tax laws and regulations are subject to change and may be subject to different interpretations (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable tax rates and requirements relating to deductibility of interest, withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures). Modifications to the tax regime by the competent authorities in those countries may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, (i) the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (“BEPS”) which is currently being undertaken by the G20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) reflects certain concerns about what is considered to be the inappropriate shifting of profits from high tax jurisdictions to low tax jurisdictions, (ii) a seven-part Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (“ATAP”) was issued by the European Commission 50 ----- in early 2016 which resulted in two adopted anti-tax avoidance directives, being Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of July 12, 2016, prescribing rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market (“ATAD I”), and Directive 2017/952/EU of May 29, 2017, amending ATAD I in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries (“ATAD II”), and (iii) the “Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (“MLI”) was published by the OECD on November 24, 2016 and aims to update international tax rules and reduce opportunities for tax avoidance by transposing results from BEPS into more than 2,000 double tax treaties worldwide. On January 17, 2023, the European Parliament approved a proposal for a further anti-tax avoidance directive that is part of ATAP laying down rules to prevent the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes within the EU (“ATAD",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.33,III”). ATAD III aims to introduce an EU-wide substance test targeted at the use of undertakings incorporated in,13.33.1,,"an EU member state that are engaged in an economic activity but which do not have a minimum level of substance in that EU member state and which, in the view of the European Commission, are misused for the purpose of obtaining a tax advantage. Whilst ATAD III was expected to be adopted and published into EU member states’ domestic legislation in 2023, and to come into effect as of January 1, 2024, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the development of the proposal and its implementation. Furthermore, the OECD and other governmental agencies in other jurisdictions have also continued to recommend and implement further changes related to the taxation of multinational companies. In particular, the OECD and G20 have committed to a proposal that allocates a formulaic share of the consolidated profit of a multinational enterprise with total group revenues exceeding €20 billion (or equivalent) in a given period and pre-tax profitability exceeding 10% calculated using an averaging mechanism to jurisdictions where their consumers are located (i.e., where sales arise), subject to certain thresholds and exclusions, resulting in additional tax in such jurisdictions (“Pillar 1”). The OECD/G20 also announced an agreement among 138 countries (as of December 16, 2022), including all G7 and G20 countries, which seeks to ensure that large multinational enterprises (i.e., that have consolidated revenues of at least €750 million in at least two out of the last four years) pay a global minimum tax rate of 15% (assessed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis) with a target of such proposal being effective domestically during the course of 2023 (“Pillar 2”). Pillar 2 seeks to achieve this by introducing two related tax measures (the “GloBE rules”): the income inclusion rule (“IIR”) imposes a top up tax on a parent entity where a constituent member of the multinational enterprise (MNE) group has low taxed income while the undertaxed payment rule (“UTPR”) applies as a backstop if the constituent member’s income is not taxed by the IIR. Additionally, a subject to tax rule (“STTR”) will permit source jurisdictions to impose limited withholding taxes on low taxed related party payments, which will be creditable against the GloBE rules tax liability. On December 20, 2021, the OECD/G20 released model rules on Pillar 2 and on December 15, 2022, the EU Council adopted a Council Directive to implement the model rules in member states of the European Union by December 31, 2023, with the IIR entering into effect for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and the UTPR entering into effect for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2024. On October 3, 2023, the OECD/G20 concluded negotiations on a multilateral instrument that will protect the right of developing countries to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on a broad range of crossborder intra-group payments, including for services. The new multilateral instrument, which is an integral part of Pillar 2, is now open for signature for countries. Finally, the European Commission has proposed a directive to produce a comprehensive solution for business taxation in the EU, commonly referred to as Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (“BEFIT”). BEFIT aims to introduce a common set of rules for EU companies to calculate their taxable base while ensuring a more effective allocation of profits between EU countries. BEFIT has the potential to alter taxing rights within the EU, and may include substantive changes to applicable tax rules (including, for example, the debt-equity bias reduction allowance proposal (commonly known as DEBRA), which would, if adopted, introduce both a tax allowance on increases in company equity and a limitation of the tax deductibility of interest payments). The consultation on BEFIT concluded in January 2023 and the European Commission adopted BEFIT on September 12, 2023. The European Commission will, after a feedback period, present the proposal to the European Parliament and Council for a legislative debate. If the BEFIT Directive is adopted, it would come into force on July 1, 2028. Further, there is a proposal for a transfer pricing directive (“TP Directive”) in the EU which aims to incorporate a transfer pricing framework into EU law to ensure a harmonized approach between the European member states including an arm’s length principle, certain rules with respect to the selection and application of the appropriate transfer pricing method into EU legislation, clarify the role and status of the transfer pricing guidelines and introduce certain mandatory documentation requirements. The TP Directive was introduced alongside BEFIT on September 12, 2023. If the TP Directive is adopted, it would enter into force on January 1, 2026. 51 ----- The structures of intra-group transactions and of our international operations, as well as judgments we make or positions we take relating to tax matters (including recent or contemplated changes in tax laws as outlined above), are based on our own interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations, generally relying on rulings or specific guidance from competent tax authorities. We cannot guarantee that our interpretations of such laws and regulations will be accepted by the relevant authorities and there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will not seek to challenge or dispute such interpretations, and the current political climate and recent political and media focus on tax optimization schemes and austerity generally increase the risk of discussions or disputes with tax authorities. Any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations applicable to us may result in reassessments, settlement amounts, late payment interest, fines and penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our operations that are profit making are subject to profit and income tax and other applicable taxes, such as property tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the future. Any change in tax laws or tax rates may increase our tax expenses and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may be subject to various tax proceedings and audits with tax authorities in respect of our operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not become subject to tax investigations in the future and the applicable tax authority may seek to proceed with an investigation. If we were to become subject to such investigations, we may be held liable for additional tax payments, including penalties and interest for late payments, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that assessment is made. Any adverse findings of the relevant tax authorities could also result in unfavorable tax treatment for the transactions in question and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any such investigations or challenges, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial time and resources to defend ourselves. Also, a material change in applicable laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable tax rates), or in their interpretation or enforcement, could force us to alter our business strategy, leading to additional costs or loss of revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. German tax authorities could treat payments made by German Guarantors (as defined in “Limitations on Validity _and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany”)_ to be subject to withholding tax for which such German Guarantor would be liable if the respective Noteholders receiving such payment is tax resident in any non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives _Steuerhoheitsgebiet) as set out in the respective legislative decree (Rechtsverordnung) referred to in Section 3_ paragraph 1 of the German Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von _Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb)._ Further, payments of interest (deemed to be) made by the Issuer or any Guarantor to entities that are considered to be related to the Issuer and/or such Guarantor, could fall within the scope of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021. It is possible that the conditional withholding tax could be applicable to payments made by the Issuer and/or such Guarantor under the New Notes. If such payments become subject to withholding tax under the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021, we will not be required to pay Additional Amounts (see “Description of the Notes— _Withholding Taxes”).

Such summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information and Underlying Data has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position or financial information of the Group would have been had the Refinancing Transactions or the Underlying Adjustments actually occurred as of the dates indicated, nor does such summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information or the Underlying Data purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position and financial information at any future date or for any future period. The summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information and Underlying Data presented in this Offering Memorandum includes non-GAAP measures and is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual amounts. In addition, we present Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA, which gives effect to the Pro Forma Transactions as if such transactions had occurred on April 1, 2023. The adjustments made to calculate the summary unaudited adjusted consolidated financial measures and to calculate _Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. This adjusted and pro forma data has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. The adjustments have not been audited by any independent auditors, should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those presented for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used. In addition, the pro forma adjustments made to calculate Pro Forma Underlying EBITDA do not reflect future events that may occur after the Refinancing Transactions, including the potential non-realization of revenue synergies, cost savings, expense reductions and contribution from the Pro Forma Transactions, or the incurrence of implementation and investment costs related to the realization of such revenue synergies, cost savings, expense reductions and contribution from the Pro Forma Transactions. For example, the contract for the Amsterdam City Tender includes certain provisions where we may receive less than the contracted revenue in the event that certain key performance indicators and targets are not met, which may result in a negative EBITDA contribution from the Amsterdam City Tender for such periods.

Although the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture and the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture and the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, including under operational leases and financial leases for parking facilities. 54 ----- The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the New Notes could have important consequences to holders of the New Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the New Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and the repayment of principal, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - restricting us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

These agreements limit our ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Parent; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain investments; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - consolidate or merge with other entities; - impair the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the New Notes; and - amend certain documents. All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. 55 ----- In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. In particular, if the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (less the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Group) equal to or exceed 40% of the Revolving Credit Facility on the applicable quarter date, the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to maintain a specified net senior secured leverage ratio. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet them. A breach of any of these provisions could result in a drawstop under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the lenders could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the New Notes. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot guarantee that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable the Issuer to repay the New Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.",13.41.1,,"Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that we will realize revenue growth and operating improvements that we anticipate or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell or sell and lease-back assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the New Notes, on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale will be on a timely basis or in a sufficient amount. 56 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

See “Description of Other Indebtedness— _Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement—Repayments.” The 2027 Notes will mature on March 1, 2027._ Accordingly, the maturity date of Facility 2 of our Revolving Credit Facility may accelerate to September 1, 2026 if the 2027 Notes are not repaid prior to September 1, 2026. The effect of the “springing maturity” is that we could be required to repay in full all of Facility 2 of the Revolving Credit Facility on September 1, 2026. We may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts owing at such date, and there can be no assurance that we will have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the amounts necessary to repay such amounts. If we do not have sufficient cash to repay such amounts when due, we will need to refinance such indebtedness, and we may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms or at all. In particular, the “springing maturity” may make it more difficult for us to refinance all of the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain of our other indebtedness matures before the New Notes, including the Existing Notes. We may not be able to refinance such indebtedness on satisfactory terms, if at all, and would be required to do so prior to the maturity of the New Notes. Accordingly, we will be required to repay substantially all of our other creditors, including with respect to the Existing Notes, before we are required to repay the principal of the New Notes, and, as a result, may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts owed to holders of the New Notes at maturity.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

As the Issuer has no material assets other than its shares in Q Park B.V., the Issuer will be dependent upon payments from other members of the Group in the form of dividends or other payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the New Notes. The amounts available to the Issuer from the other relevant members of the Group will depend on the profitability and cash flows of such other members and the ability of such other members to make payments or distributions under applicable law or regulation or the terms of any financing agreements or other contracts that may limit or restrict their ability to pay or distribute such amounts. The obligations of the Guarantors under any intercompany loans will be subordinated in right of payment to certain existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantors, including obligations under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. If the Guarantors or other subsidiaries do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the New Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the New Notes. The Guarantors (and other subsidiaries) may not, however, be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to make upstream payments or advance upstream loans to their shareholders (including the Issuer) to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the New Notes.

It is anticipated that the Issuer and the Guarantors would account for approximately 75.5% of the Consolidated EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (and for the purposes of the calculation, disregarding the EBITDA of any Guarantor, if negative, and utilizing the statutory financial figures of each Guarantor) and 72.7% of the total assets of the Group as of March 31, 2024 (and for the purposes of the calculation, disregarding (i) goodwill, (ii) fair value changes in the total assets of the Group in association with purchase price acquisition method, (iii) the impact of financial leases and (iv) third-party cash which is restricted for use in connection with cash collected for third parties under certain management agreements for which a corresponding liability is included as part of the other liabilities, accruals and deferred income). Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the New Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. As of March 31, 2024, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries had €26.1 million of third-party financial indebtedness (excluding our financial leases which are long-term property leases that are classified as financial leases for the purposes of Dutch GAAP, but as to which 57 ----- there is no option to, or obligation to, purchase the asset at the conclusion of the lease), which would be structurally senior to the New Notes.

In addition, under the terms of the 2020 Indenture and the Indenture we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the New Notes and, in certain circumstances receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the New Notes. The 2020 Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement do not limit the amount of hedging that can be given priority with respect to the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the New Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, any Operating Facilities and certain hedging liabilities will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the New Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the New Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, any Operating Facilities and such hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, any Operating Facilities and such hedging obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the New Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank pari passu and are secured on a pari passu basis with the New Notes, including the Existing Notes. As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under the New Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the New Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the New Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, any Operating Facilities, our hedging obligations, the New Notes and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the 2020 Indenture and the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the New Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined in “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66[2]/3% of the Indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and/or (ii) the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding 2027 Notes as set out in the 2020 Indenture and the Notes as set out in the Indenture (or if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding New Notes) and the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding indebtedness ranking pari passu with the New Notes as set out in the relevant documents governing such debt ranking pari passu with the New Notes (or if the required amount is not specified, 58 ----- the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding amount of such indebtedness) whose principal amount outstanding under the New Notes and such indebtedness ranking pari passu with the New Notes (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) at that time aggregate more than 66[2]/3% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representative). If, before the super senior discharge date, the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the relevant creditor representatives then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (to the extent given) comply with the initial consultation requirements, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Security Agent will comply with the instructions from the Majority Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, provided that if the super senior liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions were first issued, or no steps have been taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement action within three months of the date of the end of the first consultation period, or an insolvency event has occurred and no steps have been taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement action, then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

However, in certain circumstances the Guarantees can be set aside, such as if the granting of such a Guarantee is not in the grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. For more information, see “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Not all our assets will secure the New Notes. In the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture, the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles (as set out in the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the New Notes to require granting of, or payment or enforcement under, a guarantees or security in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security to be provided by us and our subsidiaries. The terms of the Security Documents securing obligations under the New Notes and applicable guarantee limitations may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security provided by us and our subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the guarantees and security may also be affected by local law limitations. See “—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and _may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limits or defenses that may affect their validity and enforceability.”_ On the Issue Date, the New Notes only be secured by the Initial Collateral. See “—The New Notes will be secured _only by the Initial Collateral as of the Issue Date” and “Description of the Notes—Security.” No appraisals of any_ Collateral have been prepared, and there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the New Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the New Notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the New Notes and the Guarantees, holders of the New Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangements governing our creditors’ 61 ----- rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of the Collateral must be applied in satisfaction of certain priority obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Operating Facilities and certain hedging obligations (and any other future indebtedness that is entitled to such priority under the terms of the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) before being applied to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Notes and any other pari passu debt (including the Existing Notes). In addition, the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture and the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement allow the incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The Guarantees, security interests and other obligations are also be subject to applicable corporate and other laws. In general, these laws may prohibit companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of acquiring their shares and may limit the circumstances in which companies can transfer economic benefits to their shareholders outside the payment of properly declared dividends. The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each such Guarantee will be limited to any maximum amounts that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of the relevant jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the New Notes. Further, there are laws that provide for limitations that affect the rights of creditors generally in case an entity becomes insolvent. Although laws differ among the applicable jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, equitable principles and insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral against the Guarantors or a security provider. Courts may also avoid the Collateral or the Guarantees in certain circumstances where the security provider or any of the Guarantors is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. 62 ----- The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and _Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for more details regarding limitations on the Guarantees and security_ interests under the laws of The Netherlands, England and Wales, France and Germany. In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors, the security providers or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and Collateral, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ obligations under the Guarantees or the Collateral; direct that the Issuer and/or the holders of the New Notes return any amounts paid under the Guarantees or any Security Document to the Guarantors or to the respective security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantors’ creditors or the security provider; and take other action that is detrimental to holders of the New Notes. There can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether each of the Guarantors or a security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees was issued or Collateral was created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that the Issuer or each of the Guarantors was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not each of the Guarantors or a security provider was insolvent on the date the Guarantees was issued or security was created, that payments to holders of the New Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. If the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the New Notes, and the Guarantees or Collateral is found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, the Issuer cannot assure the holders of the New Notes that it can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the New Notes. In addition, the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and/or Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document governing the Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds, and there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of the Guarantors or each security provider and whether a court would give effect to such attempted limitation. Also, there is a possibility that the entire Guarantees or security may be set aside, in which case the applicable Guarantor’s or applicable security provider’s entire liability may be extinguished and, in the case of the Guarantees, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantors and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer. Future Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, certain transaction documents are governed by U.S. law, and judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in the jurisdictions in which the assets by which the New Notes are secured are located. Instead, in many of these jurisdictions, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” Several of the factors the court will consider involve a considerable amount of discretion, and even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may take a significant amount of time to complete. If any of these risks materializes, your ability to collect payments of principal and interest under the New Notes may be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The liens in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Noteholders if we fail or are unable 63 ----- to take, or are not required under the Agreed Security Principles to take, the actions required to be taken in order to perfect any of these liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity and/or the unenforceability against third parties of the relevant security interest in the Collateral and/or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the New Notes against third parties (as the case may be), including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of the liens in the Collateral to secure the New Notes. In particular, perfection of Collateral over certain bank accounts requires certain steps to be taken.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.54,It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral.,13.54.1,,"The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and exchange rates. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The Collateral securing the New Notes will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exception, defect, encumbrance, lien, loss of legal perfection or other imperfection could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the New Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the assets comprising the Collateral are, or will be, free and clear from third-party prior ranking security rights or other interests, such as security interests arising under standard contract terms or by operation of law. Any such rights or interests would adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the 2020 Indenture, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility, any Operating Facilities, certain hedging obligations and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the New Notes, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. There may also be other practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, under German law, the enforcement of share pledges is subject to certain specific requirements, including a formal disposal process that involves a public auction. For further details, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations.”_ In addition, the shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all or part of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot guarantee that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may decline significantly. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the New Notes and the Guarantees, Noteholders (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. 64 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture provide that only the Security Agent (in respect of the Collateral governed by Dutch, French, English and German law, as security agent and Parallel Debt creditor) has the right to enforce the security interests under the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the New Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the New Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. In respect of Collateral governed by French, Dutch and German law, in order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the New Notes. The Collateral governed by French, Dutch and German law will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent under the parallel debt mechanism to secure directly the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the New Notes. In certain jurisdictions, including The Netherlands and Germany, the parallel debt concept has not yet been tested in court. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent.

For example, as a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR ceased to be published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies have ceased as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). These reforms, including the Benchmarks Regulation, may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. The consequences of any such changes, reforms or replacements cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in new interest rate benchmarks being used for the Revolving Credit Facility or additional variable rate indebtedness incurred by us from time to time, which could result in an increase in interest expense and could have a material adverse effect on any of our debt linked to such a benchmark. The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Revolving Credit Facility and our other debt linked to such a “benchmark” in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the EURIBOR benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the EURIBOR benchmark. In addition, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks,” could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a “benchmark,” including EURIBOR, and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the New Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the New Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any New Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the New Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the New Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, could constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of _Control.”_ Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding New Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such New Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding New Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such New Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of such Notes may be required to surrender the New Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected. The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of _Control” as defined in the Indenture. Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control” which allow changes in the ownership of the Issuer if certain conditions are satisfied, including if a_ specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such Change of Control on one occasion. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the New Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of New York case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the Parent’s assets and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the New Notes. 68 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Future trading prices for the New Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the New Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the New Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the New Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the New Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the New Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the New Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the New Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your New Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made for the New Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot guarantee that the New Notes will be or will remain listed and traded.

The Issuer is indirectly controlled by KKR. See “Principal Shareholders.” The general meeting of shareholders controlled by KKR is able to appoint the Executive Board of Q Park B.V. (the direct subsidiary of the Issuer) and thus indirectly determine corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, KKR has control over decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent any transaction that, in each case, requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the New Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the shareholder of the Issuer could instruct the board of the Issuer to incur additional indebtedness, sell certain material assets or make dividends, which instruction must be followed by the board unless such instruction is contrary to the interests of the Issuer, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the 2020 Indenture, the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Issuer’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce its ability to generate revenue or, if the assets distributed or sold are Collateral, could reduce the amount of the asset sale proceeds available to repay the New Notes, each of which could adversely affect holders of the New Notes. Additionally, KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Issuer. KKR may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to the Issuer’s business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to the Issuer. So long as KKR continues to control the Issuer, KKR will continue to be able to influence or effectively control the Issuer’s decisions. The interests of KKR may not coincide with your interests. Moreover, our shares are held by the Consortium members and any shareholder may decide to sell any or all of its interests at any time. Such sale would be subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the 2020 Indenture and the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. There is no assurance that the Consortium members will retain their current interests. We are currently engaged in a process of soliciting offers for the purchase of a minority stake in the Group. Although a Change of Control would not be triggered by the sale of a minority interest, it may result in the introduction of a new shareholder, and such new shareholder may have interests that conflict with your interests as holders of the New Notes. In this regard, we are in the process of evaluating a number of nonbinding offers. While we have not sought offers to sell a controlling stake of the Parent, the non-binding offers we have received vary in their terms, including in relation to the stake sought to be purchased by potential bidders. Any offers will be subject to further negotiation and diligence. Should we decide to proceed with a binding offer at any time, this may ultimately result in a change in the composition and shareholding of the Consortium described in this Offering Memorandum. Any sale of more than a minority stake will result in a change of our 71 ----- controlling shareholders and may trigger a Change of Control under the Indenture, the 2020 Indenture and the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.

We mainly operate off-street parking spaces owned by us as well as parking spaces under concessions and longterm leases from public and private landlords, with a focus on off-street purpose-built parking facilities at strategic locations. We operate 4,315 parking facilities comprising 896,187 parking spaces as of March 31, 2024 in The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland. As of March 31, 2024, our long-term business portfolio included 64 legally owned facilities, 66 ground lease facilities and five protected lease facilities, 187 concession facilities and 402 long-term lease facilities, which together comprised over 320,000 parking spaces. As of March 31, 2024, our short-term business comprised 3,591 facilities and over 576,000 parking spaces.

We benefit from an industry where demand is relatively inelastic to price, although specific contractual arrangements may limit pricing flexibility. We believe that consumer choice regarding parking is not primarily driven by price but by factors such as location and distance to destination, parking availability, security, payment type and more recently, the availability of EV charging points. In addition to this, by virtue of the type of contracts we have entered, approximately 67% of our portfolio benefits from inflation protection either through full discretion on prices or through contractually agreed inflation-linked protection and we have partial flexibility in respect of the remaining 33% of our portfolio as of March 31, 2024.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Underlying Total Revenue was €852.5 million, our Underlying Gross Margin was €287.7 million and our Underlying EBITDA was €235.5 million. Our operations in The Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom, respectively, represented 34.5%, 20.6% and 15.4% of our Underlying Total Revenue, 39.2%, 28.1% and 6.7% of our Underlying Gross Margin and 43.0%, 30.5% and 6.6% of our Underlying EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We started our operations in the European market in The Netherlands in 1998, and expanded to Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom in the early 2000s. We have consistently secured long-term contracts and built a portfolio of prime parking locations in The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Belgium and Germany, including multi-functional parking facilities near inner-city areas, public transport interchanges, airports and hospitals. Multi-functional parking facilities serve multiple urban needs (such as city centers, shopping centers, hospitals and railway stations). Due to a variety of physical, regulatory and other constraints such as cost and availability of space, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from a degree of captive demand with limited competition in some areas. We generate revenues under the following main business lines: - _Parking revenues. Our off-street parking business primarily comprises parking facilities owned and operated by us or operated by us under contract (both short-term parking and long-term parking). We have a healthy mix of short- and long-term parking customers. Short-term parking includes shorter term parking customers, such as per-hour or per-day tickets. Short-term parking generated 75.5% of our Underlying Parking Revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Long-term parking includes customers holding season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets. Long-term parking generated 24.5% of our Underlying Parking Revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Short-term parking customers provide immediate payment in cash or by debit or credit cards at the gates and physical barriers present in our parking facilities, while long-term parking customers provide revenue stability and advance payments. Underlying Parking Revenues represented 87.5% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We generally retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility. In respect of parking facilities owned by us, we are responsible for all expenses relating to the parking facility, including operation, maintenance and management. Under our concession and lease contracts, we are responsible for all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during the term of the concession or the lease. - _Non-parking revenues. o _Control fees. Control fees are predominantly generated in Denmark and represent income arising from enforcement of paid parking (for example, parking fines) in parking facilities (usually above ground) owned by the Group and/or by landlords. Landlords generally contract with parking facility 79 ----- operators like us to eliminate or reduce the misuse of parking spaces (for example, misuse of handicap spaces, parking on rescue roads, misuse of reserved parking spaces and long-term parking in spaces intended for short-term parking). Underlying Control Fees represented 3.0% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _Management fees. Our management fees business represents the fixed and variable fees we receive for operating parking facilities under contracts with third parties including public authorities as well as private landlords and other private entities. Our Underlying Management Fees represented 5.6% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _Rental income. In addition to owning, operating and managing parking facilities, we lease certain of our owned parking facilities to the municipality of Amsterdam. Rental income also includes the income from the lease of parts of our facilities to third parties that use the space for parking, storage or to provide spaces used for business operations, such as refrigeration or storage facilities for restaurants. Our Underlying Rental Income represented 1.8% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _EV charging fees. We launched the EV Charging Program in May 2022 to substantially increase the number of EV charging points in our owned and long-leased parking facilities by the end of 2024. We earn fees from our customers who use the EV charging points provided at our parking facilities. Our Underlying EV Charging Fees represented 0.8% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. o _Other revenues. Other revenues include all other revenues not included in the categories above, such as subsidies, ancillary revenues, revenue from other alternative uses of our parking facilities and other services such as vending machines placed in our parking facilities. Our Underlying Other Revenues represented 1.3% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. 1 Underlying Gross Margin excludes non-allocated and central operating costs. 2 Includes short-term leases, control fees and management contracts. We have long-term cash flow profile visibility with 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding nonallocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 comprising primarily facilities that are owned or operated under our long-term business, of which 83% are entitled to operate until at least 2033 (assuming no renewals, new business or price indexation), as illustrated by the following chart. 1 Underlying Gross Margin excludes non-allocated and central operating costs. 2 Based on Underlying Gross Margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, excluding non-allocated and central operating costs. As of March 31, 2024, the Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our long-term contracts was approximately 47 years. Furthermore, our portfolio is backed by significant real asset ownership. As of March 31, 2024, the market value of our real estate portfolio, predominantly located in large and attractive cities, was €1.8 billion. The 127 ----- portfolio comprises 123 properties consisting of legally owned and ground leases. Such market value has been prepared without comprehensive due diligence or the benefit of an inspection of all of the properties. We believe that our strategic focus on owned facilities and long-term contracts has resulted in a stable business model, which enables us to attract customers and is supported by the high volume of cars and growing urbanization where our parking facilities are located. These prime locations provide flexibility and stability to our business, combined with stability of demand, leading to revenue stability as evidenced by the historical evolution of our revenues over time. In certain circumstances (primarily in relation to concessions in France), the long-term contracts and concessions include a protection mechanism allowing renegotiation of payments to local municipalities in case a certain level of performance is not achieved, thereby providing protection in case of lower demand. Further, in respect of our ground leases, there is typically a protection mechanism where the municipality is required to pay compensation to us in the event the municipality intends to terminate the ground lease or expropriate the property, thereby providing us adequate security and stability. Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure assets, including long-term cash flow visibility, physical and high value assets, central role in the local economy, proximity to public sector players, embedded hedge against inflation, limited correlation to economic cycles, resilient revenue generation, and a favorable and stable regulatory environment with certain protections for us in the event of regulatory or administrative changes. Unlike some other infrastructure companies, our parking facilities, once operational, require relatively low levels of Underlying Existing Business Capex. Our limited Underlying Existing Business Capex, which averaged 5.0% of Underlying Total Revenue across the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, are driven by our scale and preventive maintenance measures. Underlying Existing Business Capex relates to the upkeep of our existing facilities as well as repairs to our facilities to ensure they remain fully operational and compliant in line with our internal quality standards. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from returns on these investments without the need to incur significant Underlying Existing Business Capex with respect to these facilities. Our relatively low Underlying Existing Business Capex requirement allows us to focus on investment in other key areas of growth and portfolio investments, including portfolio expansion and new business, information and communications technology (“ICT”), digital solutions, CO2 reduction and new growth areas such as EV charging infrastructure.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.19,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,337.19.1,Macroeconomic and geopolitical environment,"Our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Public demand for our services is influenced by general economic conditions, including inflation, global health epidemics/pandemics and customer preferences. The global economy experienced one of its sharpest downturns in history as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the related lockdowns and restrictions on activity. As a result of COVID-19 and the measures taken to prevent a further spread, our business was impacted globally, particularly in 2020 and 2021, by the temporary closure and restrictions on opening hours and capacity of public establishments as a consequence of the guidelines given by the respective governments of the countries where we operate. To a certain extent, the impact of COVID-19 on our business continued during the first half of 2022, particularly as a result of lockdowns in The Netherlands during the first quarter of 2022 and other restrictive measures in Germany. Although our operating performance declined as a result of lockdown measures and other restrictions in response to COVID-19, we have showed significant post COVID-19 recovery. Car park usage trends have been positive since 2022 as illustrated by the sharp recovery of revenues during these periods. After a slow start in early 2022 due to continued COVID-19 related mobility restrictions, recovery in the parking business started when restrictions were lifted. The lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions in the different markets in which we operate has led to a strong increase in our volumes (sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) and revenues and, consequently, our Underlying EBITDA in the three months ended March 31, 2024 has been above our Underlying EBITDA in the corresponding period during the year ended December 31, 2019. Further, economic contraction, heightened inflation, economic and political uncertainty and the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for the services that we offer. Economic downturns and economic and political volatility in the various markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, heightened inflation and increase in commodity and services prices may have a negative impact on purchasing power and consumer spending, which could have an adverse effect on our business and cash flows. Our business may also be negatively impacted by fluctuations in other macroeconomic factors which influence consumer spending, such as unemployment rates, tax rates and general consumer confidence. 80 ----- In addition, the attacks in Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and the conflict that followed in the Gaza Strip has created an unstable geopolitical environment in the Middle East. Further, the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022 and the sanctions imposed by the United States, the EU, the UK and other jurisdictions has negatively impacted the global economy and financial markets. Furthermore, higher energy costs and commodity prices, cyber disruptions or attacks, heightened general operating risks and disruption of logistic chains in Europe, have resulted in economic instability, market volatility and heightened inflation, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The Group has no direct exposure to Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Ukraine or Russia as none of our assets are located in any of these markets. However, we cannot predict the impact of the rising conflict between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, the impact of Russian actions in Ukraine or any other heightened military conflict or geopolitical instability that may follow, including heightened operating risks and production disruptions in the Middle East and Europe.

Our long-term business accounted for 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. As a result, our portfolio is more heavily weighted towards high-margin facilities, with a corresponding benefit to our Underlying EBITDA and profitability. In addition, because of these long-term arrangements, we are less exposed to circumstances in which contracts or leases come up for renewal on a regular basis, and where they may not be renewed, or renewed only at re-negotiated prices following a tender process. As a result, we benefit from stable and highly visible revenues and operating margins over lengthy periods. Profitability per country is driven by contract mix as the Underlying Gross Margin for each type of contract varies. For example, our legally owned properties typically require high upfront capital expenditure investment as compared to other contract types, but involve lower costs during the life of the parking facility (since we are not required to make any lease payments on our legally owned properties), thereby resulting in higher Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs), expressed as a percentage of our Underlying Total Revenue from legally owned properties. In contrast, lease contracts usually require relatively low upfront investments as compared to other contract types, but due to lease payments and costs incurred during the term of the lease, generally result in lower Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs), expressed as a percentage of our Underlying Total Revenue from lease contracts. 81 ----- Below are charts showing the percentage of Underlying Gross Margin generated by country of operation and our contract mix by Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Given our well invested portfolio of facilities in attractive and convenient locations, we are well positioned to benefit from demand based on such factors. As they apply to our own financial history, we have noted the following features. During the period under review, our financial performance demonstrates the resilience of our underlying revenue and the diversified sources of demand for our portfolio parking facilities: - _Employment, physical shopping and leisure, functional parking: Demand for our parking facilities is generated from a wide range of activities in proximity of a car park. Demand is, for instance, driven by the need for commuters to park near their place of employment, or near the place where they embark on mass transit. It is also driven by the need to use essential services such as hospitals and to park in locations where only a single operator of parking facilities is permitted, such as airports. Finally, it is driven by demand for a variety of leisure activities, such as physical shopping, and entertainment or cultural events. Each of these demand drivers in turn is driven by general economic and market conditions, as well as the overall trend in many of our geographic markets, such as increased urbanization, which may increase the demand for parking. Other factors including location, lighting and security, followed by price, drive customer demand. As a result, our portfolio of 4,315 parking 82 ----- facilities across seven countries is highly diversified to cater to our customers’ various demands for convenient parking. - _Macroeconomic resilience: Our Underlying Total Revenue over time, including through periods of economic downturn and pandemics, has been driven by the correlation of parking demand to the total number of cars driven, rather than macroeconomic factors such as inflation or GDP. However, our business was impacted globally as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the measures taken by governments across the markets where we operate. Our Underlying Short-Term Parking Revenues decreased significantly as demand for parking facilities declined due to temporary closures of public establishments and other mobility restrictions. Despite the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19, we have experienced a rapid post-COVID-19 recovery in our business after restrictions were lifted. The relatively swift recovery illustrates the long-term resilience of the parking business despite macroeconomic factors and demand for such services. See “Business—Strengths—Highly Predictable _Business and Resilient Business Model, with Strong Cash Conversion.”_ - _Focus on to off-street parking: Local authorities, such as in Amsterdam and Copenhagen, and other stakeholders are increasingly embracing pedestrian-focused urban planning and anti-traffic measures, including redirecting inner-city car flows to streamlined off-street parking. As a result, there has been a transition from on-street to off-street parking. By moving car parking from on-street to off-street, cities free up public space for pedestrians and cyclists, reducing overall inner-city congestion and contributing to a better urban quality of life. For example, the municipality of Amsterdam announced in March 2019 that it is planning a reduction of up to 10,000 on-street parking spaces by the end of 2025 (approximately 4% of total on-street spaces in the city center) with a reduction of approximately 1.1% of the number of permits every half-year in certain busy areas and is looking for opportunities to significantly reduce the car population in some areas. See “Business—Parking Revenues.” - _Electrification of car fleet: As EVs are gaining significant traction as a result of changing customer preferences, there is a growing demand for inner-city EV charging facilities, especially near public transport hubs. This demand for EV charging facilities is further accelerated by carbon neutrality goals in various jurisdictions, regulation and ESG considerations. We are committed to supporting this energy transition. See “—EV Charging Program.” - _Digitalization and disintermediation: There is growing demand to digital services in the parking business, as part of the general digitalization megatrend. Such services allow us to proactively interact with customers and include offering a pre-booking service for customers to pre-book a parking space, seamless, no-touch parking experience, automatic payment methods chosen by the customer and the flexibility to use any virtual payment method.

Our Underlying Like-for-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 8.3%, 34.6%, 12.3% and 5.7%, respectively. Our Underlying Like-for-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate has been primarily driven by mainly due to a positive portfolio impact, whereby the revenue from new business exceeded the loss of revenue from expiring contracts during such period, our recovery post-COVID-19 and increased volumes and pricing. Our portfolio changes over time are due to the addition of new contracts, M&A activities and the reduction in existing contracts due to expiring contracts, as well as the effects of acquisitions and disposals of parking facilities. Changes to our portfolio of facilities, including the size and mix of our facilities, impacts our financial performance. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 3,300 parking facilities with over 649,000 parking spaces. As of March 31, 2024, we had 4,315 parking facilities, with 896,187 parking spaces. From January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2024, we signed a total of 61 asset deals for parking facilities consisting of 38 new operating contracts for parking facilities and 23 negotiated contract renewals for parking facilities, as well as seven bolt-on acquisitions of parking facilities at our legally owned properties and under long-term leases and concessions which we believe contributed an estimated aggregate amount of €40.3 million in “run-rate” EBITDA from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2024, which represents the EBITDA generated from all new contracts signed during the relevant period, assuming that each new contract is being performed at its full maturity potential assessed by us at the time of signing of such contract on the basis that (i) all parking spaces under each contract will be made 83 ----- available during the relevant period, (ii) all revenue generating functions of our business have been realized and (iii) the customary ramp-up period has passed. When we enter into a new lease or concession agreement or acquire a parking facility, we assess the revenue potential and the optimum level of investment for that facility in order to increase its profitability and produce a suitable return on our investment or in order to generate higher Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA Margin. This will range from facilities that will benefit from extensive investment on the redesign and adding Q-Park features, which would be typical for attractive locations with expected high demand for high quality parking, to a lower level of investment and/or lease amount in facilities where cash flows are less certain and/or there is a limited opportunity to realize financial benefits from our branding and design. Our typical returns on investment are highly dependent on the type of contract and location of such parking facility. Owned assets with high upfront capital expenditure investment and infinite maturity typically have a lower return on investment, whereas concession agreements with high upfront payments but shorter duration have a higher return on investment. In contrast, lease contracts usually require relatively low upfront investments and typically have the highest return on investment. The acquisition and disposal of parking facilities under management during the period were largely driven by several strategic transactions. The integration of the Paris La Défense contract (won in 2021) into our portfolio marked one of the key highlights in terms of growth and expansion in 2022. In the second quarter of 2022, we acquired 100% of the shares in Dansk Parkerings Service A/S and ASTA ApS, a small parking operator and control fee business in the city of Randers (Denmark). Further, on August 31, 2023, we acquired Tazbell Services Group DAC, parent company of the Irish parking operator, Park Rite pursuant to the Tazbell Acquisition. We also won the public tender for the on-street management contract of Amsterdam in The Netherlands pursuant to the Amsterdam City Tender (the operations of which are reflected in our results of operations from January 1, 2024 onwards). We also acquired a parking operator and control fee business in Denmark pursuant to the Denmark Acquisition, which was completed on October 4, 2023. Most recently, we acquired Britannia Parking Group Limited, one of the leading parking operators in the United Kingdom, which was completed on June 4, 2024 and was funded using cash on balance sheet.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.20,Underlying Gross Margin[1] by Geography Underlying Gross Margin[1] by Contract Type,337.20.3,Pricing,"An important lever to influence our revenue is the ability to change pricing. We benefit from an industry where demand is relatively inelastic to price. We believe, based on market studies, that price is not a key driver of choice for our customers, being typically outranked by factors such as location, lighting and security. Combined with our attractive and well-located portfolio of assets, this factor has enabled us to proactively implement price increases closely following the consumer price index. Over the past three years, following the high inflationary macroenvironment, we were able to increase pricing in most of our parking facilities in line with inflation. In addition to this, by virtue of the type of contracts we have entered, approximately 67% of our portfolio benefits from inflation protection either through full discretion on prices or through contractually agreed inflation-linked protection and we have partial flexibility in respect of the remaining 33% of our portfolio as of March 31, 2024. 1 Refers to facilities where we have the sole decision-making authority to change prices. 2 Refers to facilities with limited restrictions on our ability to change prices (such as mandated caps to price increases or requirements to obtain landlord or municipality consent to price increases). 3 Refers to facilities where price increases are stipulated by a specific index (usually on an annual basis). At the same time, regulation has an effect on our pricing in a number of ways. First, regulation affects the level of supply, controlling new developments and the pricing of on-street parking. Second, in some areas regulators directly regulate the price of parking. For example, in France where we operate largely under concessions, pricing is mostly based on contractual indexation, which are often linked to the consumer price index and, sometimes, combined with other indicators (e.g., labor costs and/or construction costs). Third, the amount of demand is affected by regulatory policies that discourage vehicle traffic, congestion charges and other urban planning measures, and the promotion of mass transit alternatives. 84 ----- These regulatory developments can impact pricing in different ways. For instance, we have observed a trend of municipalities increasing prices for on-street parking, as part of the regulatory shift in many municipalities away from on-street parking, which in turn drives demand for our off-street parking spaces and allows us to raise our prices. Pricing is also affected by whether the parking is used on a long-term or short-term basis by our end-customers. Long-term parking, where a user or a corporate client pays a fee to use the car park (irrespective of the usage) for a longer period, such as season tickets, generally provide more stability and transparency with respect to Underlying Parking Revenues and Underlying EBITDA, while also bolstering our working capital position to the extent payment is made up front. Short-term usage, where users park on an ad hoc basis without a prior contract, is generally charged at higher rates resulting in higher profitability per hour as compared to long-term contracts but may lead to a lower level of utilization and more volatility in results. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, 75.5% of our Underlying Parking Revenues (comprising Underlying Short-Term Parking Revenues and Underlying Long-Term Parking Revenues), was generated from short-term parking and 24.5% from long-term parking (season tickets, which include monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets), of which approximately 80.7% is generated from business-to-business contracts, the remaining 19.3% from business-to-consumer contracts. We believe that we have a sophisticated pricing model, and our ability to manage pricing is enabled by our local scale and digital leadership. Our data-driven pricing methodologies include measures such as differentiated pricing models (real-time or near-time adaptation of prices based on demand and locations, such as peak hours), flexible pricing depending on frequency and duration, entry-time and step-rate pricing, online price differentiation through online pre-bookings, location-based pricing (such as premium pricing in city centers, medium-range pricing in Park + Walk locations and budget pricing in Park + Public Transport locations) and day tariffs optimization (through parking for over six to eight hours in selected locations). In addition, we increased the volume of payments processed through PaSS (Parking as a Smart Service), a service available in all seven countries in which we operate and which we believe increases the attractiveness of the parking experience of our customers.

The program has made significant progress since its launch and has been boosted by our associated €30-40 million investment plan. In early 2022, we signed agreements with EV charging point operators for EV charging in our parking facilities across Europe. The partnerships are designed to ensure ownership, continuous deployment, professional day-to-day management and performance of the EV charging points. Our EV Charging Program contributes substantially to the achievement of our ESG objectives and sustainable mobility. As of December 31, 2023, we have provided more than 12,500 MWh through our EV charging points which we believe have enabled more than 63.7 million zero-emission kilometers on European roads through our EV Charging Program since its launch in May 2022. See “Business—Corporate Social _Responsibility” for further information._ We have continuously supported our EV Charging Program as electric vehicles are becoming more popular. Our strategy to gradually deploy charging points in line with EV fleet penetration curves has led to deploying almost 1,644 charging points in 2022 despite the continuing shortages of labor and equipment in the installation sector. In 2023, we expedited the roll out regarding our EV Charging Program and deployed a total of 1,352 charging points. As of December 31, 2023, our parking facilities offer 2,996 EV charging points that are owned by us. Additionally, some of our EV charging points are owned by landlords or season ticket holders and, although our customers benefit from the availability of these EV charging points, they do not generate any additional revenues for us. Including these third-party-owned charging points, there were 4,114 EV charging points available in our parking facilities as of December 31, 2023, that generated Underlying EV Charging Fees of approximately €5.7 million, representing approximately 0.7% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our subsidiaries include those that transact business and report their financial information 85 ----- in currencies other than the euro, our consolidated reporting currency. Accordingly, our results of operations are subject to currency effects, primarily currency translation exposure; transaction-related exposures at our subsidiaries are limited because revenue and costs are largely incurred in their respective operating currencies. For our subsidiaries in countries with a functional currency other than euro, presently the United Kingdom and Denmark, income and losses are translated into euro at average exchange rates, and assets and liabilities are translated into euro at closing exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates against the euro will give rise to period-on-period differences in our results of operations. We implement certain measures to reduce the impact of such fluctuations in exchange rates against the euro. For example, the Danish Kroner is pegged to the euro with a maximum positive or negative margin of 2.25% from the mid-price of €1.00=DKK7.458178. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, 15.4% and 7.5% of our Underlying Total Revenue, respectively, 6.6% and 5.1% of our Underlying EBITDA, respectively and 5.9% and 9.5% of our Underlying Total Capex, respectively, was reported by subsidiaries whose functional currencies are different than the euro, which are Pound Sterling and Danish Kroner. We define Underlying Free Cash Flow as Underlying EBITDA less Underlying Existing Business Capex less Underlying ICT & Other Capex. Therefore, while some of our subsidiaries report Underlying EBITDA in functional currencies that are different than euro, the costs and expenses of such subsidiaries, including the Underlying Existing Business Capex and Underlying ICT & Other Capex are also incurred and reported in currencies different than euros and therefore, we believe that our translation risk and exposure is limited. See “—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Currency Risk.” We are also subject to foreign currency effects linked to loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that holds the loan. For example, entities in our Group that make Pound Sterlingdenominated loans to UK entities convert these loans into euros (their functional currency), which creates unrealized foreign currency gains and/or losses depending on the fluctuation of the underlying foreign exchange rates.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

We have consistently secured long-term contracts and built a portfolio of prime parking locations in The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Belgium and Germany, including multi-functional parking facilities near inner-city areas, public transport interchanges, airports and hospitals. Multi-functional parking facilities serve multiple urban needs (such as city centers, shopping centers, hospitals and railway stations). Due to a variety of physical, regulatory and other constraints such as cost and availability of space, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from a degree of captive demand with limited competition in some areas. We generate revenues under the following main business lines: - _Parking revenues. Our off-street parking business primarily comprises parking facilities owned and operated by us or operated by us under contract (both short-term parking and long-term parking). We have a healthy mix of short- and long-term parking customers. Short-term parking includes shorter term parking customers, such as per-hour or per-day tickets. Short-term parking generated 75.5% of our Underlying Parking Revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Long-term parking includes customers holding season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.35,Liquidity and Capital Resources,337.35.1,Liquidity,"Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by our cash from operating activities and our financings. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to meet our debt service obligations, to fund capital expenditures, and, to a lesser extent, to provide working capital and fund acquisitions. In addition, we have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital and general corporate needs, including the financing of acquisitions. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon conditions as further described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Amended Revolving _Credit Facilities Agreement.”_ Our financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including: - general macro-economic conditions, including public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics; 98 ----- - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations; - the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the interest we are obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our finance costs; - our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and - our external growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of acquiring or constructing new facilities. Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following: - funding working capital requirements, including payments under contracts, leases and concessions; - funding capital expenditures needs; - servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries; - operating activities; - paying taxes; and - funding acquisitions. We expect our sources of liquidity will consist mainly of the following: - cash generated from our operating activities; - borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility; - issuances of debt securities; and - borrowings under other loan facilities including the bilateral facilities and financial leases. Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net result, which could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole; - adverse working capital developments; - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings which bear interest at a variable rate, including our Revolving Credit Facility; and - higher capital expenditure, such as due to higher than expected expenses incurred in connection with our organic growth or acquisition strategies. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; 99 ----- - reduce or delay our planned acquisitions; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the New Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the Existing Notes, the New Notes and the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is based on linear depreciation over the expected period in use and taking the expected residual value into account. Depreciation commences on the date an asset comes into use. Amortization primarily consists of amortization of intangible fixed assets (including goodwill, concessions and other intangible fixed assets such as trade names and software). Amortization is charged as a fixed percentage of cost. Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over a period between five and 20 years. This period is derived from the long-term business profile and cash flows from the underlying assets (owned and leased parking facilities). Concessions in France involving a (finite) concession for the use of the ground and facility are depreciated on a straight line basis over the duration of the underlying concession agreements with an assumed residual value of nil. The book value of the concessions includes all capital expenditure related to the underlying parking facilities. The other intangible fixed assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic life with an assumed residual value of nil. The expected useful life and the amortization method are reassessed at the end of each financial year. At the relevant balance sheet date, we determine whether there are any indicators present that goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and/or tangible fixed assets are impaired.

Within the broader transport space, car parks are most analogous to toll roads, which have experienced the fastest pace of recovery since COVID-19. Within the parking sector, the return to pre-COVID19 volume levels and revenues indicates that large scale private parking operators (including us) have been able to successfully navigate this ultimate stress test from the pandemic. In spite of a slightly heavier exposure to COVID-19 restrictions, parking operators faced limited loss in the aftermath, indicative of a structural ability to return to pre-pandemic levels at a faster pace when compared to most traffic-exposed asset classes. For instance, our Short Term Parking (“STP”) volumes have fully recovered to pre-pandemic volume levels (based on sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities), while our Long Term Parking (“LTP”) volume remained broadly stable throughout the period impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, on a revenue basis, we have improved significantly above pre-pandemic levels, with our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 26% above the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the continued increase in volumes supported by ongoing price increases in line with inflation.

With a workforce of more than 450,000 people in the 27 EU Member States and an annual turnover in excess of €70 billion, the sector is an important economic activity. The structure of the European parking market is very fragmented, where the top three to five players have, on average, a combined market share of less than 50%. Many parking spaces are independently operated by cities, municipalities, clinics, hospitals, or private operators. In general, municipalities hold the largest market share (typically 20 to 30%), while approximately 50% of all managed parking spaces are owned by companies. The five largest private parking operators by parking spaces in Europe are Q-Park, APCOA, Indigo, Interparking and Empark. Parking operators can be segmented by offering (on-street or off-street), geographic presence, business model and contract type with the largest players typically operating across most of these dimensions. The parking sector encompasses many core infrastructure characteristics including demand stability and cashflow visibility with the combination of limited pricing regulation and price inelastic demand driving favorable pricing dynamics. The sector is impacted by various regulatory tailwinds, with municipalities increasingly adopting a paradigm shift in urban planning mainly focused on urban liveability and sustainability, which have led to a targeted decrease in on-street parking and a shift of parking supply towards off-street. The sector is also poised to benefit from structural growth drivers and macro trends including increasing car fleet levels, changing demographics, increasing urbanization, desire for cities as a leisure experience, rise of micro mobility, need for critical urban infrastructure such as last mile logistics and increasing themes around alternative uses of space. In addition, the sector is currently experiencing innovation, digitization and electrification trends that offer opportunities to impact the value chain.

The existence of physical barriers makes these types of facilities less personnel intensive. Off-street facility contracts are typically longer in duration (more than 15 years). Such facilities may be indoor or outdoor and are mostly located in or near event-driven locations such as city centers, stadiums, museums, hospitals, airports, train stations and other transportation intermodal hubs, hotels, and shopping malls. Users can rent parking spaces for the short term (on an hourly or daily basis) or long term (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly). Off-street parking also includes “Park & Ride,” which are off-street parking facilities located close to coach or rail stations or other transport interchanges. “Park & Ride” facilities aim to reduce car use and incentivize use of other transportation modes. Other parking solutions include “Park & Fly,” which provides customers the option to pre-book parking spaces at parking facilities that are located at or close to airports, and “Park & Charge,” which provides customers the option to charge their EVs using the EV charging points when parked at a facility. Off-street parking facilities are generally privately owned or owned by municipalities or public transport entities. - On-street: Paid or unpaid regulated parking spaces on the roads generally with signposting or some type of surveillance. Access to on-street parking is not controlled, and on-street parking is typically short-term in nature. Certain parking spaces may be awarded or rented to local residents exclusively. Other reserved 111 ----- spaces include handicapped, police, hotel or taxi parking spaces. On-street parking is more exposed to regulatory changes and city mobility policies. We are predominantly an off-street parking company, with off-street business accounting for 90.2% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. In recent years, there has been a regulatory shift towards off-street parking. See “—Regulatory Shift Away From _On-street and Towards Off-street Parking For Cities.” This, combined with the consolidation opportunities that_ have arisen because of such shift, is beneficial to large established players, including Q-Park. Parking facilities can also be classified, by the type of destination they serve for the customer, as mono-functional and multi-functional: - Multi-functional: These facilities serve multiple functions or destinations and are typically located in city centers. Key functions around these facilities are shopping, office, leisure, residence (e.g., bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas, events) and often other transport infrastructure (e.g., train, bus, bike). - Mono-functional: These facilities predominantly serve a single destination, for example hospitals, airport, train stations, retail malls and office buildings. Key volume drivers include railway, hospital, airport, commuting and shopping traffic.

The most common business models in our countries of operation are legal ownership, ground leases, concessions, leases (both shortterm and long term), protected leases and management contracts. - Legal ownership: Operator fully owns the grounds and the facility. Requires substantial initial investment but offers highest business flexibility, pricing power, profitability and control. Legal ownership is available across Europe. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, legal ownership contracts represented 20.4% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). - Ground leases: Ground lease refers to a (finite or infinite) limited real right to a property, such that the property is owned, or exclusive right of use is provided in or on another person’s land. The land is leased (often from a government, public authority, or private landlord) but the operator owns the facility. Given the required initial capital investment, length of the finite ground leases are typically above 50 years, typically with high renewal rates. Compensation schemes are sometimes applicable at the end of the ground lease depending on the applicable jurisdictions and agreed terms. This business model also offers high flexibility, pricing power, profitability and control. Ground leases are available across Europe. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our ground leases represented 23.8% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) and as of March 31, 2024, have an average duration of approximately 57 years. - Concessions: Gives the operator the exclusive right to operate the car park for the concession period. Concessions are typically medium- to long-term with duration ranging from 10 to 40 years. Concessions also typically require a significant upfront capital investment. The concessionaire generally pays an upfront fixed sum and/or an annual fee (whether fixed or a percentage of revenue) to the owner of the property or land (usually a municipality). Renewal is typically via a public tender process. This business model also offers high flexibility, profitability and control. Pricing power is usually contractually agreed and linked to a certain index (e.g., CPI) with ability to increase prices subject to the time and rate boundaries outlined in the concession terms. This business model is predominantly available in France. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, concessions represented 21.8% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) and as of March 31, 2024, our concessions have an average duration of approximately 11 years. 112 ----- - Protected leases: Gives the operator the right to operate the facility with the leases extending automatically. Protected leases incorporate legal protection against termination of the lease by the owner. This business model is available in Ireland. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, protected leases represented 0.7% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). - Leases: Lease length can range from one year up to 50 or more years. Both the lessee and the lessor can have the option to extend the lease and, in some cases, the lessee has the unilateral option to extend the lease. Ownership of the property usually sits with either a municipality or a private landlord. Lease renewal is via a tender or commercial process (often also under an exclusivity arrangement). Due to the periodic lease amount, leases typically have a lower gross margin. This business model is available across Europe. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, long term leases represented 22.9% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) and as of March 31, 2024, our long-term leases have an average duration of approximately 22 years. For the same period, short term leases (together with management contracts and control fee contracts (contracts for the enforcement of paid parking in parking facilities owned by landlords)) represented 10.0% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). - Management contracts: Gives the operator the right to manage a parking facility usually for a fixed fee typically with limited revenue exposure as the underlying ownership or lease belongs to a third party. Management contracts are typically shorter than five years with no or minimal initial investment required. The operator receives payment based on time spent (usually on a cost-plus basis). The operator typically bears limited revenue or cost risks. This business model is subject to competition due to lower barriers to entry and the short-term nature of contracts. This business model has no pricing power with lower margins and levels of control than other business models. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, management contracts (and other short-term business, including short term leases and control fee contracts) represented 10.0% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). During the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we derived approximately 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) from facilities that are owned or operated under our long-term business, of which 83% entitled to operate until at least 2033 (assuming no renewals, new business or price indexation).

In general, customers’ demand for parking tends to be price inelastic, which underpins favorable pricing dynamics for large private parking companies who have presence in strategic locations and parking clusters. All countries in which we operate experienced an increase in off-street pricing in the last two years, with the majority of countries experiencing a steep price increase. The biggest increase in off-street pricing was observed in The Netherlands, where the average two-hour price for off-street parking increased by 11% since 2019.

Typically, municipalities operate the largest share of the off-street market, with 20-30% market share. Belgium and Ireland are somewhat below the range while Germany is substantially above the range. This dominance of municipalities is typically lower in larger cities than in smaller cities due to higher parking prices and increased visitor volumes, which create a better business case for private operators. In all countries where we operate, there is no single private parking company dominating the local market. Belgium is the most concentrated market where the top five players (including us) jointly control nearly half of the market. The other countries in which we operate are more fragmented with the top two to four players having a combined market share of approximately 10-35%. We are one of the top private parking companies based on the number of parking spaces operated in all of our markets. Further, based on a third party consultant report, we are a top three player as of December 31, 2023, based on offstreet parking revenue, in all of the countries in which we operate, and market leader in The Netherlands. As a result of this fragmentation, a significant consolidation opportunity exists, particularly for large private parking companies, whose scale and financial resources make it possible to acquire facilities and/or contracts from smaller players or to acquire some smaller companies (through bolt-on M&A). The provision of parking facilities is also becoming an increasingly privatized business model across countries as municipalities continue to outsource the operation of both on-street and off-street parking facilities to private operators. 115 ----- Furthermore, due to market fragmentation, private parking operators try to create “clusters” in strategic locations in cities to create local scale. For example, we have clusters in key cities including Amsterdam, Antwerp, Chambery, Chartres, Hasselt, Maastricht, Rotterdam, The Hague, Toulon and others. These clusters enable the larger scale players (including us) to further increase pricing power, reduce operational costs by having a single task force servicing multiple facilities and develop relationships with local governments and municipalities, providing the opportunity to participate in regulatory reviews and decisions relating to the industry.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

As a result of pedestrian-focused urban planning and traffic and environmental concerns, local municipalities are increasingly dis-incentivizing car usage especially in large city centers. Local municipalities in various countries in Europe have been reducing on-street parking spaces and introducing maximum allowed parking times as well as increasing on-street parking pricing to drive parking traffic towards off-street facilities. For example, in the Amsterdam municipality, parking tariffs in the city center were increased by approximately 50% in April 2019 and have consistently been above off-street parking tariffs since then (on-street tariffs in Amsterdam were approximately 7% higher than off-street tariffs in 2022; Parkopedia, 2022 Global Parking Index). As a result of such factors, the growing parking demand is “pushed” towards off-street private parking as people look to park upon arriving in a city and then use other modes of transportation to move and commute to and within the city center (including buses, trams and other forms of public transportation). Some of the regulatory-driven initiatives being implemented by municipalities include: - Introduction of anti-pollution and other environmental policies (e.g., car fleet electrification, low emission zones) and reduction in on-street parking in low-emission zones - Designation of certain car-free roads within city centers - Transformation of certain off-street facilities into multi-modal hubs, creating an opportunity for partnerships with car-sharing operators in cities with limited on-street parking availability Examples from some European cities that introduced pedestrian-focused urban planning and anti-traffic measures include Amsterdam, Paris, and Copenhagen. - **Amsterdam: In 2019, the municipality of Amsterdam announced that it is planning a reduction of up to 11,200 on-street parking spaces by the end of 2025 with a planned reduction in parking permits of approximately 1,500 per year. The municipality of Amsterdam is also looking for possibilities to make some areas in the city center traffic-free. For example, in summer 2023, the municipality closed one of the city’s major traffic routes to cars in a six-week trial. - **Paris: In 2020, Paris announced it will remove 60,000 of its 140,000 on-street parking spaces to allow for more space for cyclists and pedestrians and allow for an “ecological transformation of the city.” This was subsequently increased to 70,000 with a target date of the end of 2025. This has been accompanied by a 50% increase in parking prices in the city center and an introduction of parking charges for nonelectric motorcycles (Parkopedia, Navigating The Ever-changing On-street Parking Landscape, 2022). - **Copenhagen: According to the Cycling Embassy of Denmark, on-street car parking spaces are being replaced by bicycle parking spaces. Additionally, a number of car parking spaces will be converted to flexible parking spaces for both bicycles and cars. The increase in bicycle parking spaces is expected to continue in the near future. In addition, the local authority introduced the “Cyclist Priority Plan for 20172025,” which seeks to see 50% of commuting journeys completed by bicycle. In January 2023, a further 600 on-street parking spots were earmarked to be removed in the Medieval City area in 2024. The municipality plans to cut one-third of current on-street parking spaces with another one-third transformed into parking for shared cars, disabled parking permits and business parking. Our position as a leading player in our key markets allows us to immediately benefit from the increased volume shift towards off-street parking as municipalities phase out on-street parking locations. For example, in Antwerp from August 2023, previous on-street parking locations in the historic city centre have been redesignated a parking zone where parking and public charging is restricted to residents with a parking permit, certain permit holders (care providers, car sharers, etc) and people with disabilities. The implication is that non-permit holders who would typically park on the street previously now have to find alternative parking solutions mostly entailing 116 ----- parking just outside the city centre where we have a large presence.

The initiatives also focus on achieving environmental goals (e.g., carbon neutrality). Some of the environmental initiatives include car fleet electrification, congestion charges, low emission zones, new parking policies (such as Park & Ride) and introduction of stricter speed restrictions. These trends are resulting in a decrease in on-street parking spaces and shifting demand towards off-street parking, providing significant opportunities for off-street private parking companies to capture incremental market shares in the overall parking market. Additionally, private parking companies that have good and long-standing relationships with local government authorities will be well-placed to collaborate and advise cities on smart ways to decrease traffic created from searching for parking spaces (for example, by providing dynamic parking information and encouraging drivers to pre-book their parking spaces) and then benefit from these regulatory changes driving an increase in off-street parking.

Accordingly, leading parking infrastructure players like us are better positioned than smaller operators to take advantage of positive industry dynamics and benefit from the resilience and maturity of the market. Our operations are supported by a growing customer base, well-established presence and favorable pricing dynamics. As an established market player, we have consistently grown our total revenue for the past 25 years (other than in 2020, when our revenues were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic). The European countries in which we operate have also seen continued growth in light vehicle fleet which, according to GlobalData, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.5% over the next decade. Personal cars (excluding ride hailing and taxis) are also expected to remain the most popular form of transport, accounting for 45% of trips worldwide, ahead of public transport, ride hailing and other mobility modes, according to The Future of Mobility, McKinsey Quarterly Report, published in April 2023. In addition, we believe that upfront costs and regulatory requirements (including obtaining planning permissions to build new high density parking facilities, complying with regulatory frameworks governing parking concessions and navigating contracts with municipalities) and the economies of scale that result from operating multiple facilities across multiple geographies present significant challenges for new entrants in the car parking industry in Western Europe. In addition, our long-standing relationship with municipalities enables an ongoing dialogue with public sector players, allowing us to be a key counterpart in discussions to improve local and regional mobility solutions. This provides us with opportunities to expand our existing business with such municipalities, and we are well positioned to handle their requirements. Although our volumes (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) across the broader transport sector were negatively impacted by the mobility restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022, car traffic (and closely linked to it, toll road traffic) has experienced the fastest pace of recovery among the broader transport sector. As of December 31, 2023, our LFL short term parking volumes (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities) have recovered to approximately 102% of 2019 levels, while air cargo remains below 2019 levels. A similar recovery in volume has also been experienced across other parking operators in Western Europe, demonstrating the structural resilience of the broader parking sector and a proven ability to recover from industry disruption at a faster pace compared to other traffic-exposed asset classes. Further, we believe that the parking sector is expected to benefit from key trends in the industry, including, for example, (i) the regulatory shift away from on-street parking with reduced on-street parking provisions in low emission zones and/or in densely populated cities, (ii) increasing priority given to pedestrians, cyclists and various forms of shared mobility (including car sharing and public transport) as cities and municipalities increase their sustainability focus, (iii) change in consumer dynamics to focus more on experiences and (iv) carbon neutrality and “green city” goals of various jurisdictions. The increased focus on electrifying the car fleet to meet “green city” objectives is expected to drive the penetration of EVs in Europe from approximately 1% in 2020 to approximately 18% by 2030. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends given our (i) continued focus on off-street parking, (ii) strategically located parking assets to capture continued demand, (iii) our highly developed technology platform that provides a digital parking ecosystem and seamless customer experience journey and (iv) the deployment of our EV Charging Program, which we launched in May 2022 to substantially increase the number of EV charging points (“CP”) in our owned and long-leased parking facilities to 5,500 by the end of 2024.

Based on a third party consultant report, we have a top three market position as of December 31, 2023 in all of the Western European countries in which we operate based on off-street parking revenue. Our large footprint across our seven countries of operation allows us to build on a local scale in each of these markets. Our size and scale allows us to operate our car park portfolio efficiently, for example through sharing resources among our car parks (in particular, in clusters where we operate multiple parking facilities in close proximity), including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management resources in respect of accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. The number of our locations and the connectivity of our parking facilities through our digital capabilities and proprietary technology gives us a commercial advantage and enables us to anticipate customer needs across multiple locations. For example, our access to real-time transactional data on occupancy and availability of our parking facilities enables us to better anticipate and predict customer demand. In addition, due to our size and scale, we are better equipped to make significant investments in IT and to leverage such investments across our operations compared to smaller competitors. Between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2024, we invested approximately €32 million in Underlying ICT & Other Capex, which includes investments in enhancements of infrastructure and cyber security. Such operational efficiencies and cost savings generated through IT initiatives and investments allow us to offer attractive terms to municipalities and landlords and operate a differentiated pricing model. Finally, the size and diversity of our portfolio means that we have significant experience with different operating models, allowing us to adapt effectively and efficiently to different contract types and regulatory structures. Our market leading positions, size and growth have allowed us to achieve significant economies of scale, and the scope of our operations and the quality of our assets have supported the quick recovery of our Underlying Total Revenue following the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been able to achieve operational efficiencies and cost savings through the implementation of a streamlined and lean management and governance structure across our operations. Our economies of scale enable us to be a consolidation platform for European parking operations and allow us to undertake and quickly integrate valuable new concessions and acquisitions of smaller players, as well as individual assets and lease contracts. In addition, through our experienced management team, and due to our long-standing reputation in the industry, we have been able to develop and maintain important relationships with various municipalities and private landlords with whom we do business, thereby reducing our dependence on any single local governmental authority or region. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, no single contract represented more than 3% of our total Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) and no single city represented more than 11% of our Underlying Total Revenue or our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). We have strategically positioned our portfolio to focus on off-street parking in line with the regulatory shift in favor of off-street parking. Our off-street parking business and on-street parking business represented approximately 90% and 10%, respectively, of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Off-street parking contracts are typically longer duration contracts (generally more than 15 years) in comparison to on-street parking contracts (generally less than five years). This generates long-term cash flows with a balanced mix of short- and long-term parking customers. Short-term parking customers provide immediate payment, while long-term parking customers provide revenue stability and advance payments. Further, off-street parking is supported by the presence of physical barriers, which limits fee evasion, facilitates prompt payment and enables revenue stability. Our business benefits from a portfolio of parking facilities and parking spaces which is highly diversified in terms of number of contracts, type of contract, number of municipality clients, number of private landlords and types of parking services we deliver.

We benefit from long-term visibility of cash flows, and the correlation of parking demand to the total size of the car fleet (rather than GDP) enhances the stability of our revenues over long periods and helps ensure resilience through periods of economic downturn. We have demonstrated consistent revenue growth over the past 25 years (other than during the period impacted by COVID-19), with a strong recovery following the impact of COVID-19. Although our business was negatively impacted during 2020 and 2021 as a result of mobility restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our Underlying Total Revenue has recovered to above 2019 levels, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, has grown at a CAGR of 4.2% since 2017. The decrease in our Underlying Total Revenue in 2020 and marginal increase in 2021 was primarily driven by increased volatility in Underlying Short-Term Parking Revenue, which dropped immediately in response to COVID-19 restrictions, while Underlying LongTerm Parking Revenue remained relatively stable over the period. Our performance has consistently improved independent from economic cycles, with an average Underlying Likefor-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate of 4.5% over the period from January 1, 2014 through March 31, 2024, compared to a real gross domestic product (“GDP”) average growth rate of 1.8% and consumer price index (“CPI”) annual inflation of 2.1% during the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.65,Underlying Revenue per country,337.65.2,,"Within these countries, our portfolio is spread across approximately 352 cities with no significant exposure to one city. Our top city (Amsterdam, with 31 parking facilities as of March 31, 2024) represented approximately 11% of our Underlying Total Revenue with our top 20 cities representing approximately 54% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Across these cities, we operate a tailored approach with the type of contract tailored to the country of operations. Our business primarily comprises (i) legally owned properties, (ii) long-term leases, (iii) concessions, (iv) ground leases, (v) protected leases and (vi) short-term leases. As such, we have a portfolio consisting of both parking facilities owned and operated by us as well as those operated by us under contracts (both long-term and short-term), as well as ancillary services such as our control fee business. As of March 31, 2024, our long-term business portfolio included 64 legally owned facilities, 66 ground lease facilities and five protected lease facilities, 187 concession facilities and 402 long-term lease facilities, which together comprised over 320,000 parking spaces and accounted for approximately 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, our short-term business comprised 3,591 facilities and over 576,000 parking spaces and accounted for approximately 10.4% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our parking business is also diversified in terms of location (inner city centers, hospitals, shopping areas and transport links). We believe our limited reliance on any single parking facility is a significant factor in diversifying our source of revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. Our parking facilities are typically not dedicated to a single institution or purpose and are mostly multi-functional, meaning they are used by drivers that may be using the car park to visit different locations, whether it is for work, shopping, cultural activities, or other purposes. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, 70% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) was generated by multi-functional facilities. We believe that we enjoy a prime position in the relevant local area with respect to a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Our prime locations, the multi-functionality of our car parks and the challenges in building new car parks help mitigate competition risk in our business. Further, our multi-functional car parking facilities also have alternative uses and can potentially be a source of ancillary revenues (for example, as storage facilities or refrigeration for restaurants, car rental, car sharing, bike parking, or as a last mile delivery hub). The remaining 30% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 was generated by mono-functional facilities, which are selected on a strategic basis with the aim of ensuring stability of demand. We generally target regional and/or national partnerships (for example, operating Park + Ride solutions for the Dutch railways (NS)) with municipalities and local authorities and/or transport hubs. Our parking business is also diversified in terms of our end users. We process over 100 million transactions annually across both short-term and long-term parking. This gives us access and exposure to and insight into the behavior of a highly diversified customer base. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our short-term parking business represented 66.1% of our Underlying Total Revenue from more than 81.5 million transactions. Our typical short-term parking customer pays for transactions on a per-hour or per-day basis and typically stays at our facilities for an average of two to four hours per transaction. These customers are largely occasion-driven with predominantly low recurrence. On the other hand, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our long 125 ----- term parking business represented 21.4% of our Underlying Total Revenue from more than 20.5 million individual single-stay transactions. Our typical long-term parking customer pays for the transaction in advance, usually with the purchase of a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual season ticket, and typically stays at our facilities for an average of eight to ten hours per transaction. These customers constitute our known loyal customer base and currently consist of more than 100,000 season ticket holders. The remaining 12.5% of our Underlying Total Revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 consists of management fees, control fees, rental income, EV charging fees and other income. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure companies, who typically rely on a smaller number of large contracts or concessions, or strong concentrations in a single geography, resulting in a greater concentration of risk.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Country metrics are weighted by share of Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. 2 Based on percentage change from period to period in the Underlying Parking Revenues generated from parking facilities categorized as LFL operations. We define Underyling Like-for-Like Parking Revenue Growth Rate as the as the percentage change from period to period in the Underlying Parking Revenues generated from parking facilities that we categorize as LFL operations. A parking facility is included in LFL operations: (a) until 2019, if it has an initial duration of five years or more and has operated for at least two full financial years, measured as of the beginning of the current financial year, and (ii) from and including 2020, if it has an initial duration of five years or more and has operated during the full reporting period from 2019 until the current reporting period, in each case, excluding any facilities which are due to expire in the current reporting period, facilities that are newly opened in the current reporting period and certain facilities that are not fully operational (for example, due to refurbishment). Given the foregoing, the number any identity of parking facilities making up our LFL operations up to and including the year ended December 31, 2019 is different from the number and identity of parking facilities making up our LFL operations from the year ended December 31, 2020 onward, so the periods are not fully comparable. Following COVID-19, volumes have recovered rapidly, and our total volume has been above 2019 levels since April 2023, despite price increases. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Underlying EBITDA was approximately 8% higher than pre-COVID-19 Underlying EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019. The seasonality of our Underlying Total Revenue as of March 31, 2024 is also now consistent with pre-COVID-19 seasonality. See “—Parking Revenues.” 126 ----- Our cash flow generation benefits from an advantageous working capital cycle through the collection of upfront payments (through season tickets) from our long-term parking customers and revenue collection directly upon exit of the car park for our short-term parking customers. As a result of our low Underlying Existing Business Capex and Underlying ICT & Other Capex requirements, we have achieved Underlying FCF Cash Conversion Ratio of 73.7% and Underlying EBITDA Margin of 27.6% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Our senior management team has consistently outperformed budget targets and has a strong track record of strategy execution, which can also be attributed to the senior management team’s ability to anticipate and embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector. This has enabled us to be a pioneer in the deployment of efficient transformational programs, revenue management and digitalization programs, user friendly applications, such as PaSS, and sustainability initiatives, such as our EV Charging Program. Our senior management team has also shown its capability in successful portfolio management with the constant delivery of new contracts and active acquisition activity, with 68 signed deals (seven acquisitions and 61 asset deals) since 2021. In addition, our local management teams are well-connected to industry bodies and groups as well as local municipalities and maintain strong and long-standing local relationships with the relevant regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our regional management teams also have extensive sector experience. Our regional teams comprise senior people having local presence, some of whom also hold prestigious positions with local municipalities and regulatory authorities. We believe that our parking facilities are an essential part of the urban mobility infrastructure and thus part of our contribution to the transition to zero-emission mobility. We have been contributing to sustainable mobility for many years, and have been reporting annually on sustainability, based on the GRI Standards, since 2011. While our early sustainability efforts were focused on raising awareness and integrating sustainable development in our day-to-day business, since 2017 we have shifted our focus to developing and implementing shared solutions, including through identifying how we can contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and our role in helping society progress toward Europe’s aim to be climate neutral by 2050. Our sustainability commitments are focused on key areas that have been identified as most relevant to our stakeholders, including sustainable mobility, digitization, electrification, energy consumption and liveability. Promoting sustainable mobility is central to our efforts, and we believe that our focus on off-street parking supports this goal in a number of ways. 225 of our parking facilities were located near public transport hubs as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.3% since December 31, 2022, enabling our customers to take advantage of alternative lower-emission forms of transport. As of December 31, 2023, 506 of our parking facilities offered online pre-booking, which reduces the amount of traffic caused by motorists circling city streets searching for a place to park. The increase in the availability of pre-booking solutions has been driven by our focus on digitization, primarily through PaSS, which has also enabled us to process customer information more efficiently and improved our informed decision-making capabilities.. In line with the increasing penetration of EVs in Europe, we have also significantly increased the number of EV charging points in our parking facilities, from 2,114 as of December 31, 2021 to 4,114 charging points as of December 31, 2023. In addition to supporting the shift to more sustainable mobility in the communities in which we operate, we have also improved our own performance on ESG metrics, particularly with respect to energy consumption and our overall carbon footprint. As of December 31, 2023 the total energy consumed in our parking facilities has decreased by 12.7% since the year ended December 31, 2021. Our efforts to reduce our energy consumption and to source more green energy has led to a decrease in our average carbon footprint per parking space in owned and long-leased parking facilities from 179.1 kg of CO2 in the year ended December 31, 2010 to 45.4 kg of CO2 as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 74.6%.

The 61 new asset deals and seven bolt-on acquisitions have an average contract duration of approximately 18 years and have an average period to recover the costs from the “run-rate” EBITDA of such assets of approximately five years. Since January 1, 2023, we completed four key transactions (“Recent Transactions”): - the Britannia Acquisition, pursuant to which Q-Park UK Limited acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Britannia Parking Group Limited, a parking operator in the United Kingdom, which was completed on June 4, 2024 and was funded using cash on balance sheet; - the Amsterdam City Tender, relating to the public tender by the City of Amsterdam that was awarded to Q-Park Operations Netherlands B.V. on August 14, 2023 pursuant to which Q-Park Operations Netherlands B.V. provides on-street parking services for approximately 160,000 parking spaces and will provide on-street parking services for up to 262,000 parking spaces in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and related services such as transactions, enforcement, permits and parking meters, for a period of eight years commencing January 1, 2024; - the Denmark Acquisition, pursuant to which Q-Park Operations Denmark A/S acquired City Parkeringsservice A/S, a Danish parking operator and control fee business in Denmark, completed on October 4, 2023; and - the Tazbell Acquisition, pursuant to which Q-Park Ireland Ltd. acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tazbell Services Group DAC, parent company of the Irish parking operator, Park Rite, completed on August 31, 2023. We estimate that these Recent Transactions collectively would contribute approximately €10.3 million to our Pro _Forma Underlying EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024._ Alongside our portfolio expansion, we have invested in the growth of our digital parking ecosystem, PaSS (Parking as a Smart Service), which allows us to offer increased convenience and certainty and a seamless customer experience. As of December 31, 2023, 75% of our parking facilities were PaSS-enabled (excluding management contracts and stalling garages) and 9% of LFL operations were processed through PaSS. PaSS provides us with the opportunity to differentiate online and offline parking tariffs, supporting product diversification and optimization of capacity. Across our digital platform, we focus on pre-booking revenues in event-driven areas with high and stable demand (such as airports, hotels, cruise terminals and event centers) and revenues from repeat short-term parking customers who increasingly value a seamless customer experience. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our digital revenues (calculated as revenues from (i) customers prebooking through our services as well as third party services, (ii) the Q-Park App and (iii) customers pre-booking parking at our airport facilities in the UK and Germany) were €83 million. Our digital revenues increased by 55% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 and by 40% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. We have also invested in expanding our business lines to take advantage of recent trends in the parking sector in order to generate incremental revenues. A key focus in this area has been the development of our EV Charging Program, which we launched in May 2022 to profitably expand our EV charging business through an increasing number of EV charging points in our owned and long-leased parking facilities in line with the growing demand for a publicly available charging infrastructure in our markets in Western Europe. As of December 31, 2023, we had 4,114 EV charging points across our parking facilities, which we estimate have enabled 63.7 million CO2free kilometers of driving for our customers since June 30, 2022. Adding EV charging points to our existing infrastructure enables us to take advantage of the continued trend toward electrification of the car fleet while requiring a low level of incremental investment and deploying capital at our own pace. As of March 31, 2024, we have invested approximately €12.9 million of capital expenditure in our EV Charging Program since 2022 and have realized a “run-rate” Underlying Gross Margin of approximately €4.7 million for the year ended December 130 ----- 31, 2023. We define “run-rate” Underlying Gross Margin as the annualized run-rate impact of EV charging volumes for the second half of the year ended December 31, 2023 (calculated on the basis of EV charging points installed capacity as of December 31, 2023) on the Underlying Gross Margin from our EV charging business for the year ended December 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Our infrastructure is well-invested, with a focus on the most attractive segments of the car parking market. We focus on smaller cities to benefit from their growth, and we will continue to seek to enhance profitability through portfolio optimization. We intend to focus our efforts on renewing our portfolio of existing contracts by maintaining our well invested assets to better manage future capital expenditure requirements and expanding our operations by capturing new opportunities that meet our stringent investment criteria. Due to our market leading position, scale and expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified portfolio by renewing our existing contracts and capturing new contracts in value-enhancing locations from both existing customers seeking to award new contracts and from other organizations looking to outsource the operation of their parking facilities. Our selection of facility locations is driven by our long-term strategy to operate and expand in high margin cities. Our highly diversified geographical coverage spans across approximately 352 cities that have attractive market dynamics, with a strategic and tailored approach to different markets in an effort to drive higher returns. We may also acquire high-quality smaller car parks in small- and medium-sized cities to further diversify our portfolio and benefit from the potential for growth in these cities. We believe that our balanced focus on smaller cities reduces our exposure to changing urban trends and regulatory changes in larger cities. Due to our scale, long-standing industry experience and established relationships with municipalities and private landlords, we are typically able to achieve significant synergies that also allow us to offer competitive terms and win new business. We will continue to grow our parking facilities in clusters representing multiple locations in strategic cities, which enhances our pricing strategy through a more resilient local competitive dynamic, operational cost reduction given our ability to have a single task force servicing multiple locations and strong relationships with municipalities. Our ability to build and maintain relationships with municipalities makes us well positioned to negotiate and win long-term contracts and to avoid long-term regulatory risk. We have clusters in key cities including The Hague, Amsterdam, Maastricht, Rotterdam, Toulouse, Chambery, Leeds, Manchester, London, Dublin, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Antwerp, Hasselt and Brussels. In addition, we are often able to expand our locations to further facilities once we have entered a local market by virtue of our existing relationship with local authorities and the ability to benefit from synergies with existing parking facilities.

This offers us a high degree of adaptability to the most appropriate type of contract depending on the characteristics of each model and the demand in local markets. As of March 31, 2024, we had a diversified portfolio of 4,315 parking facilities in prime locations supporting stable and high demand, and 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) comprised long-term business, with the remaining 10.4% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) comprising short-term leases and other contracts and costs (including management contracts, rental contracts, contracts in relation to our EV charging business and leases with a duration of less than one year). Our other contracts typically have a fixed fee structure, which provides secured income visibility. This enables us to optimize and balance risk and return on our investment portfolio. Further, because our contract portfolio largely comprises long-term facilities (owned facilities, leased facilities (including long-term leases, ground leases and protected leases) and concessions), our Weighted Average Remaining Duration was approximately 47 years as of March 31, 2024, which provides a long-lasting cash flow profile. We also adopt a disciplined approach with respect to new investments and the expansion of our existing business.

Key features of our technology platform include digital invoicing, Park + Events capabilities, pre-booking for city parking, on-street parking, near-time parking information, Park + Fly capabilities, equipping facilities with PaSS gateways and Park + Charge capabilities enabled by the rollout of our EV Charging Program. This is expected to serve as a basis for long-term operations standardization and digitalization. Such digital capabilities seek to increase control and ownership over data, enable the use of standard interfaces to communicate with our partners and facilitate the integration of potential acquisitions or new sites. Our digital capabilities also allow us to capture customers earlier in their journeys, by facilitating pre-booking of parking spaces via the Q-Park App, and provide opportunities for connections with third parties, such as other mobility providers and end users. Our local scale and digital leadership enable us to manage pricing. We believe that our diversified portfolio and differentiated contract offering provides price flexibility and enables us to select the contracts that best suit our investment portfolio. We are able to use such pricing flexibility as a lever to maintain stability of cash flows and sustain profitability. As demand for parking is relatively inelastic to price, we have been able to successfully pass through more than 100% of the impacts of inflation to our customers since October 2021, with no negative impacts on volume (measured by sold hours in respect of our PMS Connected facilities). Our data-driven pricing methodologies include measures such as differentiated pricing models (adaptation of prices based on demand and locations, such as peak hours, and online price differentiation with pre-booking), flexible pricing depending on frequency and duration, location-based pricing (such as premium pricing in city centers, medium-range pricing in Park + Walk locations and budget pricing in Park + Public Transport locations) and day tariffs optimization (through parking for over six or eight hours in strategic locations).

According to the IEA Global EV Data Explorer published in April 2024, the share of EVs in Europe as a proportion of the overall car fleet is expected to increase from 1.1% in 2020 to 11.1% in 2030, equivalent to approximately 61.2 million EVs. We believe that our established customer base and broad, well-invested existing infrastructure portfolio makes us well-placed to capitalize on the increasing penetration of EVs, as adding EV charging points to our existing infrastructure requires a low level of incremental investment. Approximately 85% to 90% of the EV charging market is destination charging, with a particular focus on residential, workplace and retail charging, and our existing parking facilities already cover approximately 55% to 65% of the catchment area for this destination charging, primarily through proximity to workplaces and retail locations. We have already installed 4,114 EV charging points in our parking facilities as of December 31, 2023, and we plan to have 5,500 EV charging points by the end of 2024. 133 ----- Outside of the scope of EVs, we aim to continue to focus across our business on enhancing urban liveability and connecting communities by providing sustainable mobility solutions and seamless parking services. Within a broader framework of key sustainability topics, we have focused on the top five material topics of liveability and the mobility transition, energy, digitization and innovation, renovation and maintenance and climate change mitigation, and we are in the process of developing specific key performance indicators (“KPIs”) and targets around these topics, informed by the EU Green Deal and EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ESRS”). We intend to incorporate ESRS references into our CSR report, with the goal of being fully in compliance with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the “CSRD”) by 2025, which requires a double materiality threshold for reporting standards. Therefore, in 2023, we have conducted a double materiality analysis and analyzed both our impact on economic, environmental and social matters (i.e., impact materiality) and the financial impact of these matters on our business (i.e., financial materiality). In 2023, we have developed quantitative and realistic KPIs and targets for the top five material topics. Accordingly, the following are the targets that we aim to achieve by 2040 and are linked to our top five material topics: - achieving net zero emission through a market-based approach; - procurement of 100% renewable energy; - operating 20,000 EV charging points; - enabling two billion zero-emission kilometers through our EV Charging Program; - equipping 7.5% of our parking spaces with operated EV charging points; and - ensuring 45% of parking facilities offer alternative modes of transportation. Our aim is to complete our double materiality assessment in 2024. We will continue to leverage our sustainability efforts to date, including with respect to our EV Charging Program and reducing the carbon footprint of our parking facilities, with the goal of being the most preferred sustainable mobility hub partner by 2030.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.71,Parking Revenues,337.71.1,,"Our off-street business is our largest business line, representing 91% of our Underlying Total Revenue and 90.2% of Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. This business line primarily consists of legally owned parking facilities, protected leases, ground leases, long-term leases and concessions with municipalities, private real estate investors and other parties to operate parking facilities. As part of our long-term business, we may be required to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a “green field” contract) or make an upfront payment for an existing parking facility (a “brown field” contract). As of March 31, 2024, our portfolio included 64 legally owned facilities under which we manage approximately 29,000 parking spaces, 66 ground lease and five protected lease facilities under which we manage approximately 36,000 parking spaces, 187 concession facilities under which we manage approximately 109,000 parking spaces and 402 long-term lease facilities under which we manage approximately 147,000 parking spaces. We have a diversified client base with our 20 largest cities (in terms of Underlying Total Revenue) representing 54% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our long-term contracts was approximately 47 years. Legally owned properties and protected leases run in perpetuity, and ground leases, concessions, and long-term leases are mostly long-term. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, legally owned properties, ground leases, concessions, long-term leases and protected leases had 75.3% (contributing 20.3%), 71.5 (contributing 23.8%), 45.2% (contributing 21.7%), 16.8% (contributing 22.9%) and 25.9% (contributing 0.7%) of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs), respectively. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we derived approximately 89.6% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) from facilities that are owned or operated under our longterm business, of which 83% are due to continue under their existing terms through 2033 (assuming no renewals, new business or price indexation). This ensures long-term visibility of cash flows. For the same period, we derived only 10.4% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs) from leases with an initial tenor of less than 15 years and other contracts. This long-term cash flow profile is backed by a strong asset base offering significant downside protection. Our portfolio comprises parking infrastructure located in urban areas and other areas of high traffic density, such as inner city centers, hospitals, shopping areas and transport links. Our long-term business includes a number of 134 ----- car parks with prime locations. Many of these locations are in highly transited areas that attract a large number of visitors for a variety of purposes. These locations also usually have limited free or paid alternative parking options. Competition is generally limited in the area covering a radius of approximately 700-800 meters around the car park. Except during the COVID-19 pandemic when several lockdowns and other mobility restrictions were in place, demand for our off-street parking facilities in such areas has traditionally experienced relatively low volatility and has remained relatively stable, even during difficult economic conditions. As a result of COVID-19 and the measures taken to prevent a further spread, our business was impacted globally in 2020, 2021 and 2022 by temporary closures and other restrictions on opening hours and capacity of public establishments as a consequence of the guidelines given by the respective governments of the countries where we operate. Although our operating performance declined as a result of lockdown measures and other restrictions in response to COVID-19, we believe we have showed significant post COVID-19 recovery. Car park usage trends have been positive since 2022 as illustrated by our revenues surpassing pre-pandemic levels in December 2022, despite certain measures that have been introduced to reduce emissions in densely populated areas and the number of cars in city centres, such as in Amsterdam. After a slow start in early 2022 due to continued pandemic-related mobility restrictions, recovery in the parking business started when restrictions were lifted. The lifting of COVID19 related restrictions in the different markets in which we operate has led to a strong increase in our revenues and customers and, consequently, our revenues of operation are surpassed pre-pandemic levels. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 represented an increase of 38.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Underlying Parking Revenues saw a forceful rebound to pre-pandemic levels from April 2022 onwards and surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time in December 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of short-term parking revenues which in turn stimulated the strong recovery of our operating results and cash flow generation. Our business has fully recovered post-COVID-19 due to positive volume trends (driven by the lifting of COVID-19-related restrictions on the movement of people and on the opening of public establishments that were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic) and pricing trends, demonstrating the Group’s infrastructure qualities. The seasonality of our Underlying Total Revenue as of March 31, 2024 is also now consistent with pre-COVID-19 seasonality, as demonstrated in the graph below, indicating a reversion to preCOVID-19 mobility patterns. In respect of our owned properties, where we both own and operate the parking facilities, and our properties operated under long-term contracts and concessions, we may on occasion also design, build and finance construction of the facility, including underground and multi-storey parking infrastructure facilities. If we design and build the parking facility, these green field contracts generally require us to invest capital to build a facility or make an upfront payment for an existing facility in exchange for higher potential margins and long-term concession agreements. Under our brown field contracts, we pay an annual lease or concession fee to the private landlord or municipality. Further, under our long-term contracts, we may also work together with investment companies who have earmarked funds to invest in parking facilitates that are operated by us and we then agree a lease contract with such companies. Under our concessions, we charge the end-users a tariff (or fee) for the use of the facility. Further, under our concession agreements in France, we may be required to pay annual concession fees to the municipality (in addition to a one-off upfront concession fee). The fees we charge the end-user are either on a time period basis for short-stay tickets or on a weekly, monthly, seasonal or on an annual basis under a subscription arrangement. The fees paid by end-users are specified under the concession and generally automatically increase annually in 135 ----- line with inflation. We generally retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility. In respect of legally owned parking facilities, we are responsible for all expenses relating to the parking facility. Our offstreet parking facilities are also subject to local taxes, for which we are responsible. We also generate a small amount of income through some basic amenities we provide to car park users within our parking facilities, such as vending machines and car washes. In general, our parking facilities are operated on a 24-hour a day/seven-day a week basis. Most of the features of the parking facilities are automated, including entry and exit controls and ticket machines. Users can obtain information about subscriptions and tariffs online, over the phone and onsite at our parking facilities. The car parks are staffed and operated by our own employees or contracted staff from external service providers. We operate a central control room (“QCR”), a centralized system to control and manage a substantial majority of our parking facilities from a remote location, which allows us to reduce personnel costs by reducing headcount while maintaining our high quality of services and customer satisfaction levels. Such efficiencies have led to significant savings in operating expenses as we reduced the number of operators per car park. In addition, such measures help reduce our reliance on external service providers by enabling us to reallocate personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by third-party service providers. The majority of our contracts are awarded as a result of a public bidding process conducted by the municipalities or private bidding conducted by private third parties. Each municipality has authority to determine the location and economic viability of car parks within its jurisdiction. Due to existing relationships with the municipality, the incumbent concession holder is often well positioned to negotiate an extension of the term of the contract (if permitted under the contract), or to obtain the renewal of the contract by using the information and experience it has developed to bid successfully in the new tender process. In addition to retaining our existing long-term contracts once their initial term has expired, we also seek to obtain new contracts and win contracts previously granted to our competitors. As discussed in “—Strengths” and in “Industry,” Europe represents a large and growing parking market with strong fundamentals, and the European parking sector is expected to grow based on structural drivers. The countries in which we operate have, in the aggregate, historically seen consistent year-on-year growth in light vehicle fleet from approximately 123 million in 2013 to approximately 136 million in 2022, and despite changes to car ownership models, the number of personal cars in the street is expected to continue to grow in the future. The parking sector is a mature market benefitting from favorable pricing dynamics, and the regulatory-driven shift away from on-street parking towards off-street parking for cities is expected to benefit our business. Furthermore, the off-street parking market is highly fragmented with a limited number of large players, with the top three to five companies in each country only accounting for 10% to 35% of the total market share in most countries. As a result, large private companies are well positioned to win contracts. We believe that the parking sector is expected to benefit from key trends in the industry, including, for example, (i) the regulatory shift away from on-street parking with reduced on-street parking provisions in low emission zones and/or in densely populated cities, (ii) increasing priority given to pedestrians, cyclists and various forms of shared mobility (including car sharing and public transport) as cities and municipalities increase their sustainability focus, (iii) change in consumer dynamics to focus more on experiences and (iv) carbon neutrality and “green city” goals of various countries. These trends may provide opportunities, whether in the nearer term or in the longer term, for leading car park companies like us. The long-term nature of contracts, the difficulty in obtaining prime locations and the presence of local monopolies, regulatory requirements, the need for scale, the commercial network and market recognition of existing participants and the technological leadership of the incumbents present significant challenges for new players to successfully break into the European car park market. In response to the key drivers in the parking sector discussed in “Industry,” we continue to grow supported by an underlying increase in the car fleet, our positioning in attractive markets and segments that allows for ongoing tariffs increase, our scale that positions us favorably to win new contracts and execute a strategy of accretive bolt-on acquisitions, our strong positioning in the off-street parking segment, our focus on multifunctional parking facilities and our overall strong position that allows us to benefit from various industry trends. Our local scale provides us with a strong position to profitably capture strategic opportunities in the market. We have a large and differentiated portfolio, giving us vast experience with any operating model and a high degree of flexibility with contract types. We enjoy a strong brand with a long-standing reputation for quality in parking. Our strong local presence gives us access to opportunities with unique local deal flow. Our focus on clustering results in pricing power, economies of scale and local government relations. Our leading position with local scale allows for significant operational benefits, with a proprietary technology platform in place (such as parking mobile applications, pre-booking and season tickets), an in-house car park design team, and a prudent and return-driven decision-making process. 136 ----- Our strong portfolio of value-creating assets in strategic locations limits demand risk. We focus on top-tier locations at European, country and city levels. At the European level, we concentrate on stable Western European countries, with geographical diversification across seven countries, and we especially focus on countries with attractive market dynamics where we can achieve leading (such as top three) positions. In total, we have a highly diversified portfolio across 352 cities in seven countries. Cities where we operate at least three parking facilities contribute approximately 87% to our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs). At the city level, we enjoy strong local positions and market shares due to dense clusters in key areas, and we focus on multi-functional parking facilities to mitigate demand risk. Our mono-functional facilities predominantly serve a single urban purpose, for example, public transport hubs, such as rail stations and airports, as well as hospitals and other locations with stable demand. With an increasing number of electric vehicles (“EV”) charging points, we also offer our customers the opportunity to charge their electric vehicle while parked. We intend to continue investing in EV charging points to respond to the growing demand for additional inner city EV charging facilities and near public transport hubs. The chart below shows the breakdown of our investment property portfolio by country, as a percentage of the €1.8 billion valuation of the total portfolio (which includes 123 real estate properties (mostly legally owned by us, but including, in some cases, certain ground lease properties)), as of March 31, 2024. Such market value has been prepared without comprehensive due diligence or the benefit of an inspection of all of the properties. 1 Valuation data covering a portfolio of 123 owned real estate properties and ground leases. Our properties have high replacement values, with an ability to convert space for alternative usage. Real estate property space is at a premium, in particular in premium cities where we have a strong presence, so there are opportunities to implement alternative uses for parking facilities, especially for owned assets, which do not require any external approval, and long-term leases. Our ownership of assets impacts our Underlying Existing Business Capex levels, and our average Underlying Existing Business Capex over the three twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2024 has been 5.6% of our Underlying Total Revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

City councils have been discussing initiatives, such as the reduction of on-street parking volume, re-allocation of driving lanes and on-street parking spaces to bicycle lanes, and additional spaces for parks or trees and leisure activities, to reduce traffic in cities. On-street parking is being reduced while new developments are built with limited parking spaces, thereby favoring off-street parking. Tariffs for on-street parking and resident passes have been or will be increased in certain municipalities (for example, tariffs in both Cologne and Frankfurt increased from €3 to €4 per hour), and other cities may follow suit in the future. Adoption of differentiated pricing models by municipalities is also expected to generate additional revenue for parking operators in the future. Moreover, high fines for violation of on-street parking restrictions, which most recently increased in Germany in November 2021 and range between €10 and €110 depending on the type and severity of the relevant violation, may also have a positive effect on the occupancy rate of our off-street parking facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Our management contracts generally generate lower Underlying EBITDA Margins compared to our long-term contracts and concessions. However, these contracts require minimal investment and are subject to low demand risk. Under our management contracts, we operate parking facilities for both public and private clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which is generally inflation-indexed. In some limited cases, the contracts also include a variable incentive fee element based on the amount of revenue generated and certain other quality indicators. Thus, we are not required to make an up-front payment to manage the facilities or to make significant investments in the parking infrastructure.

The rising penetration of EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in car fleets is increasing demand for charging infrastructures. We launched the EV Charging Program in 2022 to substantially increase the number of EV charging points in our parking facilities. Early in 2022, we signed agreements with charge point operators for EV charging in our parking facilities across Europe. The partnerships are designed to ensure ownership, continuous deployment, professional day-to-day management and performance of the EV charging points. Our asset-heavy business model (whereby we own the charging point infrastructure, set the prices and receive all revenues while the charging point operators install, operate and maintain the charging points for a fee) enables control on EV charging tariffs, through which we are able to report stable margins and continuously grow our business performance. Furthermore, our EV Charging Program contributes substantially to the achievement of our ESG objectives and sustainable mobility. As of December 31, 2023, we have provided more than 12,500 MWh through our EV charging points which we believe have enabled more than 63.7 million zero-emission kilometers on European roads through our EV Charging Program since its launch in May 2022. We have continuously supported our EV Charging Program as EVs are becoming more popular. Our strategy to gradually deploy charging points in line with EV fleet penetration curves has led to deploying almost 1,644 charging points in 2022 despite the continuing shortages of labor and equipment in the installation sector. In 2023, we have expedited the roll out regarding our EV Charging Program and deployed a total of 1,352 charging points. As of December 31, 2023, our parking facilities offer 2,996 EV charging points that are owned by us. Additionally, 141 ----- some of our EV charging points are owned by landlords or season ticket holders and, although our customers benefit from the availability of these EV charging points, they do not generate any additional revenues for us. Including these third-party-owned charging points, there were 4,114 EV charging points available in our parking facilities as of December 31, 2023. Our strategy of “Park + Charge” enables growth of both charging and parking revenues. We aim to significantly increase the number of EV charging points in our portfolio in the coming years in preparation for the EV fleet inflection point towards 2030. Our EV charging points across seven countries generated revenues amounted to approximately €6.5 million, representing approximately 0.8% of our Underlying Total Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.75,Regulation,337.75.1,,"Other than as described below, there are generally no specific regulations that apply to our operations as a car parking infrastructure owner and operator and, except with respect to certain of our contracts, our operations are not generally subject to the rules, regulations or licensing requirements that apply to contracts granted by municipalities and local government authorities. This is due to the fact that a substantial proportion of our operations and facilities relate to privately held properties that are subject to private contracts with third-party counterparts. Such contracts are not subject to the rules and regulations that tend to apply to properties owned by municipalities and other government bodies, which may be subject to public tendering processes and contract terms are based on specific regulations. Although there are no specific car park-related licenses, some local authorities require us to possess and abide by safety licenses. In The Netherlands, there are no national administrative regulations that specifically focus on the operation of parking garages. There are however general rules governing environment and safety, which could lead to a notification obligation and the obligation to comply with these general provisions when operating a parking garage. Other rules could include potential obligations with regard to EV charging points or other requirements applicable to EVs. Finally, depending on the exact location of the parking garage, specific municipality rules may also apply. In France, we predominantly operate under a concession model usually granted by public authorities following a public tender process in accordance with the French Public Procurement Code (Code de la commande publique). Concession agreements for parking facilities usually take the form of public service delegation agreements (contrats de délégation de service public) entered into with public authorities and which are governed by French administrative law. As such, in addition to the termination rights as provided under the relevant concession agreement, the contracting public authorities may be entitled to special rights to modify or terminate a concession agreement for public interest grounds (motif d’intérêt général) or for a serious contractor’s default (faute d’une _gravité suffisante), even if such rights are not provided for under the relevant concession agreement. Such_ concessions may entitle their holder to manage surrounding on-street parking as well as to collect parking fees, as set by the relevant public authority, on the latter’s behalf. Concession holders collecting parking fees, insofar as such fees are generally considered as public funds, may be considered as a de facto public accountant (comptable _de fait) in the event they carry out their activities beyond the remit of a lawful underlying title. As such, they may_ be held liable in case of default in the management of such public funds. In France, a set proportion of EV charging points for electric and hybrid vehicles must be installed whenever there are more than 10 parking spaces located in or adjoining new non-residential buildings. Further, non-residential buildings comprising a parking facility of more than 20 parking spaces must be equipped, by January 1, 2025, with at least one EV charging point, located on a parking space which size allows access for people with reduced mobility. Such EV charging point must be installed for each additional 20 parking spaces. Public authorities may grant subsidies for parking facility operator’s investments relating to EV charging points. Such subsidies may be granted within the framework of financing contracts with public authorities and may levy several obligations on the beneficiary of the subsidy, such as notification obligations in the event of a change of control. There are no specific licenses or approvals required in order to own and operate car parks in France. However, several other administrative authorisations could be required. Further, parking facilities in France may be considered as facilities open to the public (établissements recevant du public)_ and, as such, be subject to requirements regarding, among others, accessibility and fire safety, as well as periodic on-site visits by the relevant administrative authority in order to verify compliance with such requirements. Non-compliance with such requirements may result in sanctions, including site closure in the event of serious breaches. 142 ----- Setting up and operating parking facilities is usually subject to a prior town-planning approval by the relevant administrative authority. It may also be subject to prior administrative approval and/or environmental study under French environmental law depending on the facilities involved on the concerned site. In addition, Loi n° 2023_175 du 10 mars 2023 relative à l’accélération de la production d’énergies renouvelables (the “ENR Law”) requires the operator (gestionnaire) of an outdoor parking space with an area of more than 1,500 square meters to equip at least half of such area with roofing or shade structures integrating renewable energy production equipment, it being specified that certain exclusions are provided for under such law. In certain cases, this requirement may apply to certain parking facilities as early as July 1, 2026. In Germany, there are no national regulations that specifically focus on the operation of parking facilities. There are however general rules governing, for example, environment and safety, which may have to be complied with when operating a parking facility. Moreover, depending on the exact location of the parking facility, specific municipality rules may also apply. The Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (AFIR) entered into force on 13 April 2024. AFIR is directly applicable in the various EU countries in which we operate, without any action by national legislators. AFIR updates and replaces the current Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive (EU Directive 2014/94 EU). AFIR sets out, among other things, certain obligations on Recharging Point Operators (“RPOs”) for publicly accessible EV charging points installed following its application. These obligations on RPOs include: (a) facilitation of contactless card payments; (b) permitting ad hoc access to charging infrastructure for users; (c) providing clear and easily available information on the ad hoc price; and (d) ensuring that EV charging points are capable of smart charging. In addition, AFIR includes several obligations in relation to existing publicly accessible EV charging points that must be met by a specific date. These obligations include (a) ensuring that all such EV charging points must be digitally-connected EV charging points by October 14, 2024; and (b) all direct current EV charging points operated by them have a fixed recharging cable installed by April 14, 2025.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The compensation granted by the public authority can include, depending on the circumstances, an extension of the concession term (subject to the maximum legal term) or an increase in the tariffs chargeable to customers or paid by the contracting authorities (for on-street concessions, when applicable).

The 61 new asset deals and seven bolt-on acquisitions have an average contract duration of approximately 18 years and have an average period to recover the costs from the “run-rate” EBITDA of such assets of approximately five years. Furthermore, we concluded a number of onstreet management contracts. On June 4, 2024, we acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Britannia Parking Group Limited, one of the leading parking operators in the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the Britannia Acquisition, we acquired 629 car 143 ----- parks ranging from multi-storey parking facilities to conventional pay and display parking and added 62,000 parking spaces to our portfolio. In 2023, we signed a total 18 contracts that included three bolt-on acquisitions, ten new contracts and five renewals. In addition, the integration of the Paris La Défense contract (won in 2021) into our portfolio marks one of the key highlights in our growth and expansion, where we added 15 parking facilities and more than 20,000 parking spaces under a concession agreement for eight years. The Paris La Défense contract has generated Underlying Gross Margin of €5.7 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. The Underlying Total Revenue and Underlying EBITDA generated by greenfield parking facilities gradually ramp-up over the first three to four years after they become operational, and then typically remain stable with moderate increases due to inflationary adjustments and volume increases (largely reflecting increased demand due to increased traffic in cities) for the remaining term of the contract. Our new business strategy is outlined centrally following broader corporate strategy. New business opportunities are mainly sourced by local business development (“BD”) teams. Our Chief Financial Officer supervises the central business development department. The central business development team sets the direction by supporting and challenging the local business development teams in developing new business proposals. They are engaged in all strategic transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions and divestments. We have a well-established and disciplined process for evaluating new business opportunities. Centrally, we maintain a multi-disciplinary Investment Committee (“IC”) comprising members of our senior management team in Business Development, Real Estate and Finance that reviews and evaluates new business opportunities. New business proposals with an annual lease commitment or accumulated investment of greater than €0.1 million require Executive Board (“EB”) approval, and are submitted to the IC by our local BD teams. Proposals and financial models submitted as part of this process must follow standard rules and formats, and all project proposals must include key assumptions, security margins, sensitivity analyses, benchmarking and an analysis of expected competition. The IC may ask for clarifications on the proposal or advises on changes to a proposal submitted by local BD teams. The proposal is reviewed by our IC which provides a recommendation to the EB to reject the proposal, approve the proposal or to approve the proposal under certain conditions. When evaluating an opportunity, the IC considers targeted returns, the proposed contract terms, expected consumer demand for the parking facility, potential risks and possible economies of scale with the existing business. Contracts are only signed after formal approval of the EB. We believe that this dedicated approach allows us to properly evaluate and respond in a timely and efficient manner to potential business opportunities. Projects with an annual lease commitment of greater than €10 million or initial investments greater than €10 million must also be approved by our shareholders. Approved projects that are won and become operational are subject to a subsequent monitoring follow-up plan that can last over five years.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.78,ICT and Operations,337.78.1,,"Our ICT strategy is focused on improving our data infrastructure and analytical capabilities to enable an increasingly advanced pricing strategy. Our revenue is driven by volumes and pricing, with volume being driven by the location of the parking facility and targeted sales initiatives and price being actively used to increase revenue as demand is relatively inelastic. Data analytics are key to enable more advanced pricing management. Day-to-day pricing management is crucial given low marginal costs. Pricing in the parking market is moving from pay-by-the-hour to pay-by-the-minute, and from periodic price adjustments to continuous optimization in our high-traffic, busier facilities, where differentiated pricing models produce higher revenues. Our pricing strategy is to focus on setting the right price at any time in any facility. This includes customizing pricing plans for individual car parks to maximize revenue based on central sharing of best practices, applying tariffs that suit the location, the services offered in the surroundings of the facility (for facilities serving casinos, restaurants, offices and shopping centers) and the customer, creating big data analytics to analyze and react to customer behavior, and optimizing a mix of short-term and long-term rates to leverage both peak-hour short-term rates as well as downtime long-term utilization. Our pricing management is based on careful analysis and monitoring, with analysis performed at a parking facility level. The availability of data analytics support pricing segmentation and the rounding of parking tariffs, among other innovations. Our resulting pricing improvement initiatives include differentiated pricing models during events and based on specific needs (such as lunch time specials), flexible pricing based on frequency and/or duration, and optimization of day tariffs in facilities where a significant number of customers park for more than six or eight hours. 144 ----- Another example of our investment in ICT is PaSS (Parking as a Smart Service). The core engine of PaSS is a cloud-based technology platform that allows us to interact and provide services virtually to our customers and business partners via a “plug-and-play” approach. We use automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) to identify customers at our car parks (at entry and exit), charge them via a central cloud-based billing engine and allow them to pay automatically via a chosen electronic payment method. The benefits of this digital transformation include: - For our customers: o Seamless, no-touch parking experience in and out of our car parks, requiring no ticket, no physical payment card or cash, and no queuing; o Automatic payment via a method chosen by the customer and linked to their profile, with multiple number plates per user allowed; o Flexibility to use any automatic, virtual payment method linked on profile, such as personal debit or credit cards, digital wallets, direct debit or third-party mobile applications (e.g., EasyPark, KBC banking mobile application, or mobile payment methods like 4411 in Belgium); o Ability to digitally buy longer-term subscriptions, to pre-book a parking space or to “payas-you-go” with a post-payment electronic invoice, which can be provided after every transaction or in bulk; and o Increased choice for parking as well as charging (in addition to the limited, on-street options in cities). - For our business partners, such as landlords, municipalities or commercial third parties like EasyPark or Ticketmaster: o Easy on-boarding onto our digital platform, which is completed as a “plug-and-play” mechanism via application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for third parties; o Ability to offer a differentiated, higher level of satisfaction and convenience to customers, as customers would no longer need to use paper tickets or validation machines and can make bookings online easily; and o Flexibility for landlords and municipalities to accelerate the journey towards “smart parking” within “smart cities” through seamless integration via our digital platform into the wider “smart city” ecosystems. - For us: o More engaged and loyal customer base and stronger collaboration with third-party business partners, which leads to increased parking transaction volumes and revenue across sales channels; o Ability to centrally harness transactional data, which allows us to customize our offering and pricing to individual customers based on their preferences and parking behavior; and o A standardized digital platform that eliminates the complexity of operating non-standardized facilities with varied local characteristics and on-site technology, which results in reduced operating expenditure and capital expenditure costs. We have experienced positive results from continued investments in digitization (via PaSS) and have begun to experience the benefits of the commercial insights it delivers. PaSS is now available in all of the seven countries in which we operate, in 459 parking facilities. It is anticipated that PaSS will drive further mobility through both our own online sales channels, our Q-Park App and third-party partnerships, including with 4411, easypark, easytrip, KBC and RingGo. Through our third-party partnerships, we have a direct connection for on-demand, pay-as-you-go short-term parking via our partners’ apps. Other partnerships include collaborations with purpose partners and providers of public transportation. This also allows us to offer tailored customer propositions and differentiated pricing. Through our ecosystem partnerships, we also have the ability to react more proactively to 145 ----- innovations like “smart city” concepts and “mobility as a service” (“MaaS”). As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our: - total digital revenues were approximately €83 million, with an increase of approximately 8% in our total digital revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2023; and - digitization efforts have resulted in approximately 9% of all parking transactions being processed via PaSS (paperless and seamless). A key pillar in our operating model is the Q-Park Control Room (“QCR”), which we believe is a differentiating factor compared to our competitors. The QCR is an international help desk, available 24/7, and its employees have direct access to on-site employees, service technicians and the customer service department. The QCR gives customers instant access to multi-lingual employees who can provide help and support with queries relating to the payment system or relating to accessing or exiting the parking facility. The QCR improves quality, customer satisfaction and by remote operations delivering efficiency, by decreasing working hours and the number of complaints and lowering parking management costs. We believe that automation and advances in technology can enhance customer experience, lower labor costs, improve cash management and increase overall profitability. We have introduced a number of automation and technology based services in recent years, including a large scale LED program, parking guidance and access systems and cashless payment solutions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Following the entry of CSRD into force in the EU on January 5, 2023 and our obligation to start reporting in 2026 for the year ended December 31, 2025, we intend to use the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (the “ESRS”) where applicable and relevant, as per the Commission Delegated Regulation 2023/2772 of July 31, 2023 supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU as regards sustainability reporting standards. As part of our ESG considerations, we set targets for at least the top five key themes we have identified and align these themes with our key programs such as (i) the energy program, which includes EV charging points, renewable energy generation, sourcing and energy storage, (ii) the sustainable mobility partnership program which includes mobility hubs and mobility partnerships, (iii) the digital program, which encourages sustainable mobility innovation and seamless parking services and (iv) the CSR program, which includes our CSR strategic framework, emission-free and liveable cities, embedding ESG and sustainability principles into our Group’s processes, services and products. Our guiding principles include: (i) meeting the needs of today without limiting the needs of future generations, (ii) aligning with our purpose, vision, ambitions and activities, (iii) iterating and evolving over time to get closer to desired results, (iv) engaging stakeholders to share goals and clarify efforts and (v) prioritizing the most significant impacts on the environment and society. Sustainable development is an important aspect of our values and strategy. We are committed to the furtherance and achievement of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those pertaining to affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure and sustainable cities and communities. Our sustainable development activities and contributions include the following: - increase substantially the share of renewable energy in energy consumption. Equipping selected and above ground parking facilities with solar panels, wind turbines and other means of generating renewable energy and focus on energy efficiency of equipment, installing LED lighting and sensors, and other operational measures; - develop high-quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure by offering (i) attractive offstreet parking facilities, which make urban amenities and essential amenities such as hospitals, airports, universities and city centers, more accessible and (ii) mobility hubs to enable customers to easily change to public transport, bicycle or other modes of transportation; - upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries by investing in LED lighting to reduce energy consumption, installing EV charging points to support electrification of the urban fleet, renovating, repurposing and upgrading existing parking structures, working with environmentally-friendly and circular building materials and methods; - enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization by working closely with local authorities to analyze changing mobility patterns and devise innovative responses, such as implementing smart parking tariffs and increasing the number of parking permits for residents and pre-booking options; - reduce adverse environmental impact of cities and provide access to secure parking spaces. We aim to reduce car traffic created from searching for parking spaces by providing dynamic parking information and encouraging customers to pre-book their parking space. We also aim to provide off-street parking to help create car-free zones and public spaces which can be transformed into urban parks and town squares; - provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible green and public spaces by offering offstreet parking to create car-free zones and public spaces that can be transformed into public venues; - support links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning by providing “Park + Ride” solutions and being part of mobility hubs, which contribute to connecting rural and urban areas and reducing car traffic in city centers; 147 ----- - share knowledge and cooperate with third parties by encouraging students to conduct research into urban mobility and parking issues through our Student Award scheme in partnership with Erasmus University Rotterdam, holding annual educational events on parking and mobility; and participating in industry-wide events and opening our database for academic research; - enhance policy coherence for sustainable development by developing and adapting sustainability policies according to our stakeholders’ needs; - enhance local, national and international partnerships with public and private organizations to implement sustainable technologies for EV charging, sustainable power generation and urban mobility; and - encourage effective partnerships through our sustainable mobility partner program. Tangible ways in which we have carried out actions to meet our sustainability goals include our focus on offstreet business, which contributes 90% of our Underlying Gross Margin (excluding non-allocated and central operating costs); our reduction by more than 50% of market-based average carbon dioxide emissions per parking space between 2021 (93.3 kilograms) and 2023 (45.4 kilograms); our reduction by 12.7% of energy consumption (only parking facilities; excluding GWh consumed by EV charging points) between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023; our LED lighting initiative across our parking facilities, which further contributed to the reduction of energy consumption and cost; our focus on bicycle parking solutions, which experienced a growth of 47.2% between 2021 (55 parking facilities with designated bicycle parking) and 2023 (81 parking facilities with designated bicycle parking) and the installation of EV charging points, which also experienced a growth of 94.6% between 2021 (2,114 charging points) and 2023 (4,114 charging points) and which are now available in approximately 283 facilities across all the seven countries in which we operate (as of December 31, 2023) with plans for further roll-outs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,337,SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,337.85,Competition,337.85.1,,"The off-street car parking industry in Europe is highly fragmented with a limited number of large players. We believe that most countries in Europe have between three and five large private companies in the car parking market, accounting for between 10% and 30% of the total market share in such countries. Accordingly, market dynamics make it possible for large private players to acquire small competitors at discounted multiples, thereby driving market consolidation and scale. Due to our scale, long-standing industry experience and established relationships with municipalities and private landlords, we are typically able to achieve significant synergies that also allow us to offer competitive terms and win new business. However, we face competition from other parking operators in the bidding process for contracts and concessions. We also face this competition when our concessions and contracts come up for renewal and when we bid on concessions of others which are coming up for renewal. Due to our highly diversified business mix and long-standing relationships with a diverse number of local authorities, we believe that we are well positioned compared to our competitors. Since the Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our long-term contracts was approximately 47 years as of March 31, 2024, we face limited competition in the near future to maintain our portfolio. Additionally, there are several barriers to entry to obtain new contracts and concessions. These barriers to entry include having the relevant experience, technology and being familiar with the relevant administrative tender processes. Our parking facilities face competition for end-users with nearby parking options. In general, we believe endusers are not willing to park more than a short walk from their intended destination, so competition is generally based on location and proximity to a customer’s intended location (covering a radius of approximately 700-800 meters around the car park). Therefore, we may face competition from parking structures built nearby. We believe this competition is normally limited since many of our parking facilities have limited direct competition within easy walking distance and the risk of new structures being built is mitigated by the cost and difficulty of developing new parking facilities in city centers due to the high density and planning regulations. Despite a limited number of private facilities surrounding our concessions, the terms of the concessions provide us with some exclusivity within the areas covered by the relevant concession. We benefit from broad country diversification, 148 ----- scale and focus on a strong asset base or infrastructure-driven contract mix. Furthermore, we believe that in comparison to our leading competitors, many of whom act as only concession holder or operators, our highly diversified business mix, which is focused on ownership and long-term contracts, our limited reliance on municipalities, which gives us flexibility on capital expenditure, our presence in attractive and high-growth countries and cities, and our strong local positions and market shares with a focus on multi-functional parking facilities place us in a strong competitive position.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

In the event of any refinancing or replacement of all or any part of the Senior Lender Liabilities (or any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness from time to time), the Parent shall be entitled to require that the definition of Instructing Group (as defined below) is amended such that the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness is treated in the same manner as the Senior Facilities (meaning that for the purpose of calculating the voting entitlement of any person, at the option of the Parent all or any part of the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness may be treated as Senior Secured Credit Participations of the Senior Creditors and not Senior Notes/Permitted Financing Credit Participations). In the event that any Priority Facility becomes subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent shall be entitled to require that all or any part of the liabilities in relation to Hedging Liabilities and/or the Operating Facility Liabilities shall rank in right and priority of payment _pari passu_ with that Priority Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may result in such Hedging Liabilities and/or, as the case may be, Operating Facility Liabilities ranking ahead of the Senior Notes liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing liabilities, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities) in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements. Any Priority Facility implemented pursuant to a Debt Refinancing shall comply with, among others, the following limitations: _Ranking of a Priority Facility_ No liabilities or obligations in respect of any Priority Facility may rank in right and priority of payment ahead of the Senior Lender Liabilities (other than amounts of the type set out in paragraphs (i) and (ii) under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”). Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements, any Priority Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the Parent. _Enforcement: Priority Facility_ The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Facility to: (a) instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security; 171 ----- (b) give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the security as they see fit; and/or (c) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group, shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured Parties than, those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if any), in each case as at the date such Priority Facility is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the Group and as determined by the Parent (with any such determination to be conclusive). _Option to Purchase_ (a) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation to the Senior Lender Liabilities as set out under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured _Liabilities—Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Financing Secured Creditors.”_ (b) The Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative(s) shall be provided with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out under the paragraph captioned “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent _Liabilities.” Supplemental Security_ Without prejudice to the provisions set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority” and “—Application of Proceeds”_ and the other rights of the Debtors under the Intercreditor Agreement and the debt documents, if any member of the Group enters into any hedging agreement or Operating Facility Document at any time after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (which is not already secured by the Relevant Original Transaction Security), any Debtor may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time grant to the relevant Hedge Counterparty or, as the case may be, Operating Facility Lender Supplemental Security securing all or any Hedging Liabilities arising under the relevant hedging agreement or, as the case may be, all or any Operating Facility Liabilities arising under the relevant Operating Facility Document. A Debtor may grant Supplemental Security to any secured creditor in connection with all or any part of any New Debt Financing. The Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries agree that Supplemental Security may be granted by any Debtor in order to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities, any Operating Facility Liabilities and/or any New Debt Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set out this caption shall: (a) restrict the rights of the Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries to enforce and/or to release all or any part of the Relevant Original Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents; or (b) restrict, limit or prejudice the rights and other benefits of the Debtors or any member of the Group under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document. Each of the Secured Parties agrees not to take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability of the Supplemental Security by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking (or any other lower ranking).",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Senior Parent Notes Creditors and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors agree that, until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, they may not take any steps to appropriate the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer subject to the Security Documents in connection with any Enforcement Action, other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set out in the preceding paragraph shall not impair the right of the Senior Parent Creditors and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors to institute suit for the recovery of any payment due by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer in respect of the Senior Parent Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (in each case to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower). _Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-Group liabilities and the liabilities of the Group to an investor are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders, but does not purport to rank any of those liabilities as between themselves. _Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_ The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that the Debtors (or any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees of such liabilities) or refinance or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring guarantee liabilities in respect of such refinancing or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu with any other liabilities and/or share pari passu 173 ----- in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities and/or to share in any security behind any such other liabilities. The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the cost of the Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and facilitating such financing, refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is not prohibited by the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely manner. In particular, but without limitation, each of the Secured Parties authorizes and directs each of its respective agents and the Security Agent to execute any amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt documents and/or (subject to certain pre-conditions) release and retake of security required by the Parent to reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including, as regards the ranking of any such arrangements). If a Debtor incurs any new, additional or increased liabilities under any Secured Debt Document and/or in connection with any Debt Refinancing, at the option of the Parent, the relevant Debtor may (but subject to the relevant Debt Financing being elected to be secured in accordance with the applicable terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the agreed security principles) grant to the relevant Secured Parties in respect of all or any part of such New Debt Financing additional security by executing additional security documents which will benefit from the order of priority and ranking set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the New _Notes, our Structure and our Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of The Netherlands, England and Wales, France and Germany may differ from and be less favorable than the bankruptcy laws or insolvency law of other jurisdictions.”_ 215 ----- In addition, the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws and will be subject to certain statutory limitations and defenses applicable to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, liquidity protection or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally). As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee, or the security interest in the Collateral may only be enforceable to a limited extent or not at all. For example, any Guarantee granted by a Guarantor located in France must be for its corporate benefit. As a result, the amount guaranteed will be limited an amount equal to the benefit received by such Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the New Notes, _our Structure and our Indebtedness—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limits or defenses that may affect their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other security provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the New Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in connection with the issuance of the New Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after the payment of any super priority obligations including the Senior Credit Facilities, any Operating Facilities and any hedging obligations, would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the New Notes, the _Guarantees and our Structure—The New Notes will be secured only up to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the New Notes and the Guarantees and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the New Notes and the Guarantees.”_ In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Trustee for the New Notes on the New Notes Issue Date will have, and by accepting a New Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph. If and for so long as the New Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer shall notify the Authority of such redemption and, in addition to such publication, not less than 10 days nor, except in the case of a notice given in connection with a defeasance of New Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, more than 60 days prior to the redemption, the Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed or otherwise transmitted, such notice to Holders by firstclass mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar; _provided that, for so long as any New Notes are represented by Global Notes, notices of redemption to Holders_ will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream (and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph), each of which shall give notices to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests.

In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such New Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), New Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, or the redemption date as permitted to be delayed under the Indenture.

In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the 2029 Notes Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the 2029 Notes Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the 2029 Notes Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Company or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the New Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any New Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or its successor, where applicable, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been complied with or satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, or a successor to either where applicable, has or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer or a Guarantor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any payment on any New Note or Notes Guarantee, or in each case any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail or otherwise transmit to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the purchase date will be no earlier than 10 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is mailed or otherwise transmitted. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. 225 ----- The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” expressly permits a third party to obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the relevant series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes of such series that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Notes of a series have validly tendered and not withdrawn such Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of such series, Notes of the relevant series owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which any Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of any Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment of the loans under the Amended Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes under the 2020 Indenture. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the then existing financial resources of the Parent and its Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors— _Risks related to the New Notes, the Guarantees and our Structure—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase New Notes upon a Change of Control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture. 226 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the New Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the beneficiary or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the New Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above. 223 ----- In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of the New Note to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such New Note would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such New Note directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request. If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any New Note or Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee (copying the Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Trustee and the Paying Agent may rely on the fact that any Officer’s Certificate contemplated by this paragraph has not been furnished as evidence of the fact that no withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction is required. Wherever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of New Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the New Notes or Notes Guarantees, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euros, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. 230 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and written notice of such occurrence is received by a trust officer of the Trustee from the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Parent is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the New Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the New Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the New Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any New Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer. In the event 297 ----- of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee, the transfer agents and the registrars may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the New Notes. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for book-entry interests in the Global Notes only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. Please see “Transfer _Restrictions.”_ Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Issuer’s Paying Agent in London. To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the New Notes. The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the New Notes; however, owners of the bookentry interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream as applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the Agents nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.2,"Insolvency Regulation”), which entered into force on June 26, 2015, and applies to insolvency proceedings",256.2.1,,"opened on or after June 26, 2017. Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court, which has jurisdiction to open “main insolvency proceedings” in relation to a company, is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” There is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any company or legal person has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office. The rebuttable presumption that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and if a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant. Where the “centre of main interests” of a company is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized and given effect to (subject to some exceptions) in all the other Member States (other than Denmark), although “secondary proceedings” may be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark), in the circumstances described below. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open secondary proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; 300 ----- - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of a Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” (before the opening of main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after the opening of main insolvency proceedings) only in the event that a debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State (not being the Member State in which such debtor has its “centre of main interest”). For territorial proceedings only, there is the additional requirement that they can only be opened where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. The effects of “territorial proceedings” or “secondary proceedings” shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the Member State where such proceedings are opened. The determination of whether a company has an “establishment” and where it is situated is also a question of fact and is not a static concept. As such, an establishment could be created and may change from time to time. According to Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, an “establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. 301 ----- Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries or a Guarantor experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of, and the security granted by, the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries and/or any Guarantor. The insolvency and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or (subject to the framework provided for under the EU Insolvency Regulation) conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.3,The Netherlands,256.3.2,General,"There are three insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. The third, a composition outside bankruptcy or moratorium of payments proceedings, allows debtors in (early) financial distress to propose restructuring plans to their creditors and shareholders outside of formal insolvency proceedings, with the prospect of the debtor being able to continue on a going-concern basis. All three insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of these insolvency regimes is set forth below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes 302 ----- effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party (which includes the debtor) the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the Noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a Noteholder in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. Furthermore, the debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar _Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang)._ There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a Noteholder’s potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the Noteholders may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may 303 ----- dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause Noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such renvoi proceedings could also cause payments to the Noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “— _Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.”_ Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. _Dutch Scheme_ With the implementation in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act and the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is inspired from the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the U.S. Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in moratorium of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against a Dutch Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not 304 ----- incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the New Notes under the Indenture and therefore the New Notes. Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, Holders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the Holders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantee and security. The articles of association of the Issuer permit the issuing of notes and the granting of security interest. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance _van betaling). As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the issuing of the New_ Notes, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that the Issuer, a Dutch Guarantor or the 305 ----- bankruptcy receiver or the administrator of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a New Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such New Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in The Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set-off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusive is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered. The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions. In proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority, including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Netherlands law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Netherlands rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure on security rights created under Netherlands law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Netherlands law. Under Netherlands law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of The Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and The Netherlands Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke _Rechtsvordering). Under Netherlands law, shares in a Dutch B.V. (private company with limited liability; besloten_ 306 ----- _vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch_ law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The actio pauliana provisions offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the New Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the New Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the New Notes, any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the New Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The liabilities and obligations of the French Guarantors are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code and French corporate benefit rules; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering of the New Notes (including any additional New Notes) which the Issuer has (i) applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each French Guarantor and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through intercompany loans, cash pooling arrangements or similar arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such Guarantor or (ii) used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to a French Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through intercompany loans or similar arrangements and that are, in each 307 ----- case, outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such Guarantor. The granting of a guarantee by a French company must be for its corporate benefit (intérêt social). There is no statutory definition of corporate benefit under French law and the existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit to the French Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact. Based on current case law (which provides no clear guidance): - the company giving the guarantee must itself receive an actual benefit or advantage (direct or indirect) from the transaction involving the giving of the guarantee taken as a whole which is commensurate with the liability which it takes under the guarantee; - the financial commitment assumed by the guarantor must not exceed its financial capability; and - (as regards group benefit, if applicable) the guarantor and the person whose obligations are being guaranteed must belong to the same group and real common economic purposes and policy, and the guarantee, and the transaction to which it related, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of the group as a whole (not just its shareholders) and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with such group benefit. In certain circumstances, where a French company acts in breach of its requirement to act for its corporate benefit, its officers may incur civil and/or criminal liability. In addition, under French law, a French court may, under certain circumstances, set aside a guarantee granted by a French company if such company derives no corporate benefit and banks or financial institutions that would directly benefit from fraudulent guarantees or security may also be held liable under French criminal law, as accessory. While the granting of guarantees by a parent company with respect to the obligations of its subsidiary are deemed to be, in principle, for the corporate benefit of the parent company, the granting of cross or upstream guarantees by a subsidiary may be more problematic from that perspective. Furthermore, under French financial assistance rules, certain limited liability companies (including in the form of _a société par actions simplifiée) may not advance funds, grant loans or grant security for the purposes of the_ subscription or the acquisition of its own shares by a third party. Breach of French financial assistance rules may result in criminal liability for the officers of the company acting in breach of these rules and their accomplices. This prohibition is applicable in all circumstances as the French Commercial Code does not contain any “whitewash” (or similar) procedures. However, in any event, the provision of loans or the granting of security for the aforementioned purposes may trigger corporate benefit issues regardless of the form of company involved. Accordingly, the Guarantees granted by Guarantors incorporated under the laws of France (each, a “French",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

No lien searches are available for other types of security interests_ which are not registered, such as, amongst others, certain types of share pledges (nantissements de comptes titres). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of security interests which are not subject to public registration. _Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_ Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the New Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the New Notes if we, or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par _actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly_ established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of the French entity which issued the securities which are pledged. _Enforcement_ The obligations of the French Guarantor under the finance documents to which it is a party shall constitute legal, valid and binding obligations under the laws governing the relevant finance documents. Collateral governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be enforced following a payment default or an acceleration resulting in a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount that is due and remaining unpaid. Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets (including security in the form of a pledge over securities accounts) may be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) before a court, (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or (ii) to the extent provided 309 ----- for in the relevant security document, contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets in favor of the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure) as described above, the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by a pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte _commissoire). In proceedings regarding an attribution judiciaire or an pacte commissoire, an expert is appointed_ to value the Collateral (in this case, the pledged assets) (such valuation being made by reference to the date of enforcement) and, if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured liabilities, the secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. On the contrary, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of the secured liabilities, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such pledged assets, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured. An enforcement of the pledged securities could also be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. Such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, therefore, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of our Group as a going concern. As a result, if the Security Agent enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (i) as described above, the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of all secured creditors. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the pledged assets, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. If the Security Agent enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (ii) or (iii), there is a risk that the secured creditors may not be able to re-sell the Collateral for its full value as determined by the expert, yet may still be required to pay the pledgor, upon the Security Agent having become the owner of the Collateral, the difference between the value of the Collateral and the amount of the secured debt if the Collateral is determined by the expert to have a greater value than the amount of secured debt. In addition, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted that foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment, products or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, in particular in the areas of energy and transport) may require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business. Where any of the sectors specified by law or regulations are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure: - a transaction as a result of which a non-French investor (or a French entity under the control of a nonFrench person including notably non-French tax residents) directly or indirectly (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code or (ii) acquires all or part of a standalone business (branche d’activité), in both cases, of a French entity or an unincorporated entity registered in France, including branch (succursale) of a non-French entity; - a transaction as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor (or a French entity under the control of a nonEU/EEA entity including notably non-French tax residents) crosses, directly or indirectly, the threshold of 25 % of the voting rights of a French entity (non-listed) or of 10% of the voting rights of a French company which shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market in France, the EU, or in EEA Member State. When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French authorities which must within 30 business days following the date of receipt of a request for approval provided application is complete. Where further analysis is required by the French authorities, an additional phase of 45 business days may start (failing which authorization within such period shall be deemed to have been rejected). The French authorities may grant such prior authorization with or without specific commitment imposed on the foreign investor. 310 ----- We can provide no assurance that the approval of the French authorities would not be required in order to allow the Security Agent to enforce the pledge over the shares of the Guarantors and/or any of its subsidiaries or that such approval, if required, would be granted. In addition to these limitations, specific insolvency-related limitations may prevent the enforcement of security interests in the context of court-assisted or court-administered proceedings. _Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_ There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement,_ except for Articles L. 626-30 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings and more specifically for the implementation of classes of affected parties, pre-existing subordination agreements must be taken into consideration. This assumes that the affected parties have brought them to the attention of the court-appointed administrator. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. _Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account pledges by French courts_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking pledges over the Collateral located in France. A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers)_ in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de _titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in_ which the shares of such a company are registered. Section I bis to article L. 211-20 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which came into force on January 1, 2022, provide that creditors benefiting from multiple pledges over the same financial securities account shall be ranked (i) according to the date on which the financial securities account statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement) has been signed or (ii) as otherwise contractually agreed between the parties. In case of multiple pledges over the same financial securities account, the pledgor in the name of which the pledged securities account is opened or any beneficiary of such a pledge shall notify that pledge to the entity in the books of which the relevant pledged securities account is held (i.e. the company issuing such financial securities or any intermediary referred to in article L. 211-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code or a credit institution). The creation and enforcement of second ranking pledges over certain assets has not been tested before French courts, and there can be no assurance that second ranking pledges over such assets would be upheld if tested. Accordingly, there is a risk that a second ranking pledge over such assets may be held void or unenforceable by a French court. _Parallel Debt_ Under French law, prior to the recent reform of the security agent regime pursuant to Ordonnance n°2017-748 of May 4, 2017, which came into force on October 1, 2017, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. The holders of interests in the New Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the New Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the New Notes and Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly 311 ----- secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the New Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the New Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). None of the Parallel Debt mechanisms constructs as set forth in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement have been generally recognized by French courts. There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. Com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 _Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by the laws of the state of New York and rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France. Such decision recognized that subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy (ordre public international) rules. This decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of enforceability in France of the right of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French Supreme Court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefitting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New Notes will not be entitled to rely on the Parallel Debt construction to receive on the basis of such construction any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the New Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following default or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the New Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère), that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The security documents are granted to the benefit of inter alios the Trustee. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the New Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee. In addition, the opening of a conciliation proceeding entitles the debtor to request the court to impose grace periods to creditors, pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code. The court will be entitled to delay or reschedule (i) for a maximum duration of two years, claims that are due and payable by the debtor or (ii) for the remainder of the conciliation proceedings, claims that are not due. All guarantors and security providers (either legal persons or individuals) could benefit from the grace periods granted to the debtor by the court pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code. See “—Conciliation Proceedings” below. 312 ----- _Grace Periods_ A French court may, pursuant to article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, grant a debtor a period of time (up to two years) to perform its payment obligations and this shall freeze any enforcement procedures (mesures _d’exécution forcée), but not preservation measures (mesures conservatoires) that may have been initiated by the_ creditors. Pursuant to article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, a French court may also decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is so deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the prevailing legal rate as published annually by decree) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. Guarantors and security providers (either legal persons or individuals) cannot benefit from grace periods granted to the debtor by the court pursuant to article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code. The application of such grace periods cannot be excluded contractually.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

To the extent that the French Guarantors are operating a public service in France, any contract to which they are a party would need to be drafted in French. However, it is not clear from either the law or caselaw whether agreements entered into by the French Guarantors and which do not relate to their public service mission, as well as documentation which is only referred to in an agreement to which the French Guarantors are party, shall also be drafted in French. A cautious reading of the Toubon Law provisions would lead to the conclusion that these other documents and agreements should also be drafted in French in order to avoid any risk of unenforceability. In any case, a more accurate risk assessment could be carried out based on the review of the concerned documentation when provided. A party to an agreement entered into in violation of the above may not invoke the provision drafted in a foreign language which would be detrimental to the party to which such provision is opposed, rendering it unenforceable. Although the French Guarantors signed a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in French and a translation of the Indenture was made, it cannot be excluded that the provisions of the finance documents in the English language to which the French Guarantors will be acceding could be unenforceable on the basis that they are not in French to the extent that the French Guarantors are operating a public service. In addition, the question arises of whether the requirement would extend not only to the actual contracts signed, but also to any other instrument to which the contract relates, so that in the case of security documents granted in such context, French language should be used not only for the security documents itself but also for any finance document to which the security document relate.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard (which no longer exists under French insolvency law), judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings. Further, under the EU Insolvency Regulation, French courts may have jurisdiction over (i) the main insolvency proceedings of a company incorporated in the jurisdiction of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) if the centre of main interests of such company is deemed to be in France and (ii) the secondary insolvency proceedings of a company having an establishment in France and its COMI in another Member State (other than Denmark). In the case where a debtor is a legal person, the place of its registered office shall be presumed to be 313 ----- its centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the centre of main interests of a company is in France, French courts will take into account an array of factual elements. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. Consequently, the commencement of pre-insolvency or insolvency proceedings at the level of a company which has provided security and/or a guarantee in respect of the New Notes may limit the ability of holders of the New Notes to enforce a guarantee and/or security granted by such company in relation to the New Notes. A directive (EU) 2019/1023 “on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132” has been adopted by the European Union on June 20, 2019. This directive has been transposed into French law with the Ordinance No. 2021-1193 of September 15, 2021 and its application decree of September 23, 2021 came in force on October 1, 2021 (the “2021 Reform of French",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

A French insolvency court may also refuse to enforce a guarantee if it is determined that the grantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was granted and that the relevant secured party had knowledge, at the time the guarantee was granted, of such insolvency.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.6,"Insolvency Law”). The 2021 Reform of French Insolvency Law has a material impact on French insolvency law,",256.6.1,,"particularly with regard to the process of adoption of restructuring plans under insolvency proceedings. According to this directive and the 2021 Reform of French Insolvency Law, “affected parties” (i.e., including notably creditors and therefore the Noteholders) shall be treated in separate classes which reflect certain class formation criteria for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. Classes shall be formed in such a way that each class comprises claims or interests with rights which reflects sufficient commonality of interest based on verifiable criteria. As a minimum, secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. A restructuring plan shall be deemed to be adopted by affected parties, provided that a majority in the amount of their claims or interests is obtained in each and every class (according to the directive (EU) 2019/1023, the required majorities shall be laid down by Member States at not higher than 75% in the amount of claims or interests in each class, it being noted that Member States may require that in addition, a majority in number of affected parties be obtained in each class). If the restructuring plan is not approved by each and every class of affected parties, the plan may however be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority by applying a cross-class cram-down, provided notably that: - creditors that share enough commonality of interest within a class benefit from equality of treatment and are treated in proportion to their claim; - the plan has been notified to all affected parties; - the plan complies with the best interest of creditors test (i.e., no dissenting creditor would be worse off under the restructuring plan than they would be in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or sale as a going concern or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not to be confirmed); - as the case may be, any new financing is necessary to implement the restructuring plan and does not unfairly prejudice the interest of creditors; - the plan has a reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency of the debtor or ensuring the viability of the business; - the plan has been approved: - by a majority of the voting classes of affected parties, provided that at least one of those classes is a secured creditors class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors class; or, failing that, - by at least one of the voting classes of affected parties or, where so provided under national law, impaired parties, other than an equity-holders class or any other class which, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going-concern, would not receive any payment or keep any interest, or, where so provided under national law, which could be reasonably presumed not to receive any payment or keep any interest, if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied under national law; it is specified that member states may increase the minimum number of voting classes of affected parties or, where so provided under national law, of impaired parties; - the plan complies with the relative priority rule (i.e., dissenting voting classes of affected creditors are treated at least as favorably as any other class of the same rank and more favorably than any junior class). By way of derogation, Member States may instead provide that the plan shall comply with the 314 ----- absolute priority rule (i.e., a dissenting voting class of creditors must be satisfied in full before a more junior class may receive any distribution or keep any interest under the restructuring plan); and - no class of affected parties can, under the restructuring, plan receive or keep more than the full amount of its claims or interests. Member States may maintain or introduce provisions derogating from the conditions above where they are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan and where the restructuring plan does not unfairly prejudice the rights or interests of any affected parties. The following is a general discussion of pre-insolvency or insolvency proceedings governed by French law (as amended essentially by Ordinance No. 2014-326 dated March 12, 2014 and in force since July 1, 2014, Ordinance No. 2014-1088 dated September 26, 2014 and in force since September 28, 2014, Law No. 2015-990 dated August 6, 2015 and applicable to reorganization proceedings opened as from August 7, 2015, Ordinance No. 2016-131 dated February 10, 2016 and in force since October 1, 2016, and No. 2016-1547 of November 18, 2016 modernizing the justice system, in force since November 20, 2016, Law No. 2016-1691 dated December 9, 2016, in force since December 11, 2016, Ordinance No. 2017-1519 dated November 2, 2017 and in force since November 4, 2017 and Ordinance No. 2021-1193 of September 15, 2021 and its application decree of September 23, 2021, in force since October 1, 2021) for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the New Notes. _Insolvency (Cessation des Paiements) under French Law_ Under French law, a company is deemed cash flow insolvent (en cessation des paiements) when it is not able to pay its debts which are due with its immediately available assets taking into account credit lines available to it, and debt rescheduling or moratorium which its creditors have granted to it. The date of cash-flow insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of cash-flow insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that sanctioned an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the suspect period (see below). _Grace Periods_ The Noteholders could be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code Civil).Pursuant to these provisions, French courts may, in any civil proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations over a maximum period of two years and/or decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate as published twice a year by administrative decree of the French Ministry of Economy) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal. If a court order under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace period ordered by the relevant judge. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. When the debtor benefits from the commencement of conciliation proceedings, these provisions shall be read in combination with Article L 611-7 of the French Commercial Code. See “—Conciliation Proceedings” below. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced _conciliation proceedings may, during the conciliation proceedings, impose grace periods on creditors that have_ been called to the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) but have not granted the efforts requested by the conciliator. Similarly, during the implementation of a conciliation agreement, the judge may impose grace periods on creditors that have been called to the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement. The 2021 Reform of French Insolvency Law extends this protective measure to all guarantors and third-party security providers (either legal persons or individuals). _Warning Procedure (Procedure d’Alerte)_ In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for warning procedures. Indeed, as regards companies incorporated as société anonyme, when there are elements which they believe put 315 ----- the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, the statutory auditors of a company must request the management to provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures, the auditors must request that a board of directors (or the equivalent body) be convened and may request to be heard by the President of the relevant Commercial court. At a later stage, and failing satisfactory explanations or appropriate corrective measures, a shareholders’ meeting shall be convened and the auditors present a special report on this occasion. Further to the shareholders’ meeting, if the auditor considers that the decisions made do not ensure the company’s existence as a going concern, he/she must inform the President of the relevant Commercial Court of the warning procedure and may request to be heard by the President of the relevant Commercial court. As regards companies not incorporated as société anonyme, similar warning procedures exist even if the practical details slightly differ. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of article L. 611-2-2 of the French Commercial Code, when the urgency of the situation requires the adoption of immediate measures and if the management fails to act, the statutory auditors may inform the President of the relevant court as soon as the first information has been given to the president of the board of directors or supervisory board or to the legal representatives of such company (pursuant to articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2, L. 251-15 and L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code). Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee (or, in their absence, the employees’ representatives) have similar rights. Furthermore, pursuant to the provisions of article L.611-2 of the French Commercial Code, the President of the Commercial Court can also himself summon the management of a commercial company (an even a sole proprietorship), including but not limited to companies incorporated as sociétés anonymes, to provide explanations on elements which the President of the court believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy (or when the company has not filed its financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite his injunction). Pursuant to the provisions of article L. 611-2-1 of the French Commercial Code, the competent Civil Court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) will also be able to exercise the emergency procedure for debtors subject to its jurisdiction. _Court-assisted Pre-insolvency Proceedings_ A company that holds an interest in France, whether it be its main center of interests or a mere establishment (article R.600-1 of the French Commercial Code) and that faces difficulties may request the commencement of court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc or _conciliation),_ the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders under the aegis of a third-party trustee (mandataire _ad hoc or conciliateur), whose name can be suggested by the debtor, appointed by the President of the relevant_ court (usually the Commercial Court). These proceedings are amicable, confidential (subject to the details below as regards conciliation proceedings) and do not involve any automatic stay. _Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic, legal or financial nature but_ are not insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements), although statutory law does not explicitly provide that only solvent debtors are eligible for mandat ad hoc proceedings. Mandat ad hoc proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory auditors if any) and are not limited in time. Although not expressly mentioned in the provisions governing mandat ad hoc in the French Commercial Code, _mandat ad hoc proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating_ creditors has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implementing such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent insolvency proceedings (for a partial sale alongside a safeguard plan only). To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such _mandat ad hoc_ proceedings and the _mandataire ad hoc_ must, after the opening of such subsequent insolvency proceedings, report to the Court on the measures taken to receive offers, notwithstanding the confidential nature of the mandat ad hoc proceedings. The mandataire ad hoc’s duties are determined by the relevant court. This mandataire ad hoc is usually appointed in order to facilitate the negotiations with the debtor’s main creditors or stakeholders but he cannot coerce the creditors to accept any proposal: the restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors will be 316 ----- negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis, those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they generally abstain from doing so. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of the mandataire ad hoc can be reported by the latter to the President of the court but is not sanctioned by the court or the President of the court. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period as set forth in Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above). Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or any request made to this end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of _mandat ad hoc proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor’s counsel relating to such proceedings,_ are deemed null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of Justice (currently such proportion is 75% of the fees). _Conciliation Proceedings Conciliation proceedings are available to a debtor that faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic_ or financial nature but which is not insolvent or has not been insolvent for more than 45 days. The debtor, may in its sole discretion, petition the President of the Commercial Court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name the debtor can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and stakeholders for reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings are confidential (subject to the below) and may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being able to request a month extension so that its total duration can be up to five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, although the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the President of the Court or the Court itself. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to individually claim payment of their claims, but those that have agreed to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for the time of the discussions. However, if, during the conciliation proceedings, a creditor initiates a legal action against the debtor or gives the debtor formal notice to pay, the debtor retains the right to petition the President of the Court for debt rescheduling for a maximum of two years in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor (i) has formally put the debtor on notice to pay or is suing for payment (including if such action was initiated prior to the opening of conciliation proceedings) or (ii) has not accepted within the time limit set by the conciliator (conciliateur) a standstill request, pursuant to Article L.611-7 of the French Commercial Code. In that case, the President of the Court who commenced the conciliation proceedings has jurisdiction and will take his/her decision after having been informed by the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. All guarantors and security providers (either legal persons or individuals) benefit from such grace periods granted to the debtor by the court (see “Grace periods” above). Upon its execution, the agreement reached by the parties becomes binding upon them only and the creditors party thereto may not take action against the company in respect of claims governed by the agreement as long as it is complied with. Since the 2021 Reform of French Insolvency Law, all guarantors and third-party security providers can also benefit from this stay of proceedings imposed on creditors, pursuant to article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, without such formalities being an obligation on the parties, the agreement can be either: - upon all parties’ request, acknowledged (constaté) by the President of the court, upon submission by the debtor of a declaration stating that it is not insolvent at the time or that the agreement has the effect of putting an end to its insolvency. The acknowledgment makes the agreement immediately enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire) although it keeps the conciliation proceedings confidential; or - upon the debtor’s request, sanctioned (homologué) by a decision of the court, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (i.e.: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement puts an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern; and (iii) the agreement does not infringe the rights of the non-signatory creditors). The judgment will make the conciliation proceedings public only in respect of the existence of the _conciliation_ proceedings but not in respect of the content of the agreement (except for the guarantees, liens and security interests granted to secure the agreement as well as the amount benefitting 317 ----- from the New Money Lien detailed below, as provided for in the agreement) which shall have the following specific consequences (in addition to those relating to an acknowledged agreement): o creditors who provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-petition and post-petition claims (other than certain pre-petition employment claims and procedural costs), in the event of subsequent insolvency proceedings (the “New Money Lien”); and o in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (cessation de paiements) and therefore the starting date of the suspect period (as defined below) cannot be set by the court at a date earlier than the date of the final decision sanctioning the agreement by the court, except in the case of fraud (see “Insolvency (Cessation _des paiements) under French law” above);_ o in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings (including accelerated safeguard proceedings referred to below), judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the court may not reschedule the payment date of the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien nor write off those claims without their holders’ consent even within the framework of classes of affected parties; o the social and economic committee (previously known as works council) or employee representatives are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and interested parties may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office of the Court (greffe); and o when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is transmitted to its statutory auditors. When acknowledging or sanctioning the agreement, the President of the Court or the Court may appoint, upon request of the debtor, the conciliateur as mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord to supervise the performance of the agreement for the period corresponding to the duration of this conciliation agreement. Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract by diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of conciliation proceedings or any request made to this end are deemed null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor’s counsel relating to such proceedings, are deemed null and void with respect to the portion of such fees above a proportion fixed by order of the Minister of Justice (currently such proportion is 75% of the fees). While the agreement (whether acknowledged or sanctioned) is in force, by law (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims governed by the agreement are suspended, (ii) accrued interests of the claims governed by the restructuring agreement cannot be compounded (notwithstanding Article 1343-2 of the French Civil Code) and (iii) the debtor retains the right to petition the President of the Court who opened conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code in relation to creditors (other than public creditors), who were called to the conciliation with respect to their claims which are not governed by the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the _mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord appointed to supervise the performance of the restructuring agreement, if_ the conciliator has been appointed in such capacity and taking into account the conditions of the restructuring agreement’s performance. Joint debtors, personal guarantors, or any third party that granted a security interest may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement (whether acknowledged, sanctioned or not) as well as from grace periods and stay of proceedings granted in the context of _conciliation_ proceedings (Article L.611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code). In case of breach of the agreement, any party thereto can petition the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, exception for those amounts already paid to them. Conciliation_ proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of participating creditors’ has been sought to prepare the disposal of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to 318 ----- implement such sale (plan de cession) in a subsequent insolvency proceeding (for a partial sale alongside a safeguard plan only). To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such _conciliation_ proceeding and the conciliator must, after the opening of such subsequent insolvency proceedings, report to the Court on the measures taken to receive offers, notwithstanding the confidential nature of the conciliation proceedings. Finally, conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority of creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard proceedings as described below. _Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_ A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “Insolvency _(Cessation des paiements) under French Law” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to_ attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission _d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court._ If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative_ or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period (i.e., post commencement of the proceedings but prior to plan adoption) if the debtor becomes insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: - the court may decide the conversion at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor with the exception of (i) (b); - the court may also act upon its own initiative, except in the case of (i) (b); and - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers and the social and economic committee (if any), and after having obtained the opinion of the Public Prosecutor. In case of (i)(b) only, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor if the draft plan was not approved by the relevant classes of affected parties or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances. As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in 319 ----- order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Since the 2021 Reform of French Insolvency Law, new cash contributions granted after the opening of insolvency proceedings can now benefit from a privilege (the “Post Money Privilege”). This new privilege is only allowed to cash contributions of “fresh money” (excluding refinancing of a pre-petition debt) as a loan (excluding equity contributions) and occurs in the following circumstances: - during the observation period, to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during that period of time; provided that such financing is approved by the court after it has confirmed that the financing is indeed necessary for the continuation of the business during the observation period – such new money does not need to be specifically approved by the creditors in any subsequent plan and will remain protected even if the subsequent plan is rejected; or - in the context of the implementation of a safeguard plan, pursuant to the terms of that plan, in which case the new financing would need to be disclosed as part of the plan submitted to the vote of the classes of creditors and approved by them. Such financing would necessarily have to be conditional upon the approval of the plan before it could be provided; or - in the context of a modification of the plan, adopted by the court. As for the New Money Lien, in the context of subsequent insolvency proceedings, the court may not reschedule the payment date of the claims benefiting from the Post Money Privilege nor write off those claims without their holders’ consent even within the framework of classes of affected parties. Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (including debt write-offs, debt rescheduling or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors who, alone or together with their subsidiaries, have less_ than 250 employees and a net turn-over of less than €20 million, or a net turn-over of less than €40 million. In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs, debt rescheduling or debt-for-equity swaps proposed, as the case may be. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-forequity swap which requires the agreement of each individual creditor in writing) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefitting from the New Money Lien (following a conciliation proceeding) or the claims benefitting from the Post Money Privilege (new cash contributions occurred during the observation period or in the safeguard plan) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no cancellation of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. 320 ----- Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent two years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and from the sixth year, of at least 10% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. _Classes of affected parties based consultation: Since the 2021 French Insolvency Law Reform, the classes of_ affected parties (or creditors’ classes) mechanism has replaced creditor committees and is now be coupled with the ability to implement a cross-class cram down (as detailed below). In safeguard proceedings, the requirement to place affected parties into classes for voting is only mandatory if the debtor, alone or together with its subsidiaries, has 250 employees and a net turn-over of at least €20 million, or a net turn-over of at least €40 million. However, below those thresholds, the insolvency judge may permit classes to be constituted at the request of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to each affected party the modalities of allocation into classes and the calculation of the votes corresponding to the claims allowing them to express a vote. The amount of the claims taken into account is the one indicated by the debtor and certified by his auditors (or, where applicable his chartered accountant). A creditor therefore does not necessarily represent the same number of votes depending on the value of his claims. The classes of affected parties are determined according to a criteria of community of economic interests (communauté d’intérêts économiques), justifying that all creditors and shareholders whose rights are affected by the draft safeguard plan be grouped together within the same class. The allocation of the creditors into these classes is left to the discretion of the court-appointed administrator but on the basis of genuine objective criteria and should, however, respect three imperative requirements: - creditors with security interests and other unsecured creditors must be divided into separate classes, which implies the formation of at least two classes of affected parties; - the class formation must be consistent with pre-existing subordination agreements which presupposes that the affected parties have brought them to the attention of the court-appointed administrator (within ten days of receipt or publication of the notice sent to it to that effect by the court-appointed administrator - article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code); and - equity holders are allocated upon to vote within one or more classes unless they are not affected by the draft plan. This class is only required if the draft plan entails a change in rights, capital or articles of association, such as an accordion effect. If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the New Notes), all holders of such debt securities will be assigned to one or more classes of affected parties. Each relevant affected party, the debtor, the Public Prosecutor, the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative is entitled to challenge that determination of classes before the court within 10 days of the notification of the determination. _Classes of affected parties-based consultation—Adoption of the plan:_ Following discussions between the debtor and the affected parties, the draft plan, which may include any type of restructuring option (including with respect to corporations, debt-for-equity swaps), must be submitted to the classes to vote. The classes have to vote within a 20 to 30-day period (which can be reduced by the judge to 15 days). The decision is made by each class, requiring a two thirds majority (in claims value) of the class members having cast a vote. For equity holders and holders of securities giving access to the capital, the majority conditions applicable are those of the general meetings, as the case may be. After the adoption of the plan by all the classes, the court must sanction it, which it can do only after it has confirmed that the plan meets several conditions, including that: 321 ----- - the affected parties within a same class received an equal treatment and were treated proportionally to their respective claims; - the plan is reasonably capable of preserving the debtor’s business, and - the “best interest of creditors” test is met in respect of the dissenting creditors within a given class. As defined by the 2021 French Insolvency Law Reform, the so-called “best interest of creditors” test implies that the court must verify that none of the affected parties that have voted against the plan is in a less favorable situation as a result of the plan than it would have been if the plan had not been sanctioned, and instead there had been either a judicial liquidation of the debtor (with such creditor receiving payment according to the prescribed order of priority), a sale of its business as a going-concern or a better alternative solution. Classes of affected parties cannot propose any competing plan during safeguard proceedings. If the plan is not approved by the classes, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the courtappointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor and be forced on the classes that voted against the plan: this is the cross-class cram down mechanism. _Classes of affected parties-based consultation—Cross-class cram down:_ In instances where the plan was rejected by one or several classes, it may nevertheless be adopted by the court and forced upon the dissenting classes; provided that the following main conditions are met: - the debtor requests (or approves the court-appointed administrator request for) the application of the cram down procedure; - the plan complies with the criteria mentioned in the section “—Classes of affected parties-based _consultation—Adoption of the plan” above;_ - the plan was approved by a majority of classes (including a class of secured creditors or a class ranking higher than the class of unsecured creditors) or, failing that, by at least one class of creditors who would be “in the money” in a liquidation or sale of the business as a going-concern scenario; - the “absolute priority” rule is satisfied, which means that the creditors of a dissenting class must be fully repaid in order for a lower-ranking class to be entitled to any payment or to retain an interest under the plan. That rule only applies in the event where the plan is adopted through a cram down; and - the plan should not permit a class to receive or retain more than the full amount of its claims. In instances where one or several classes of equity holders were constituted but voted against the plan, the court can still have recourse to the cram down mechanism but only if the following additional conditions are met: - the debtor alone or with its subsidiaries has 250 employees and a net turn-over of at least €20 million, or a net turn-over of at least €40 million; - it is reasonable to assume that shareholders would be “out of the money” in the event of a liquidation or sale of the business as a going-concern scenario; - if the new plan encompasses the issue of new shares, such shares are proposed in priority to the shareholders (in proportion of their existing rights); and - the plan does not provide for the compulsory assignment of the shares of the equity holders belonging to the classes that voted against the plan. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the classes of affected parties, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditor’s representative or the Public Prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. 322 ----- _Specific case- Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and_ unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. _Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard_ A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée). Such proceedings must be preceded by conciliation proceedings, which will create an opportunity to discuss the plan at an early stage and therefore to obtain greater support. While it was initially designed for larger companies, the 2021 French Insolvency Law Reform removes all applicable thresholds so that all companies, regardless of their size, will now have access to the new accelerated safeguard proceedings. The 2021 Reform of French Insolvency Law removed the accelerated financial safeguard from French insolvency law. It should be noted that despite the fact that accelerated financial safeguard no longer exists under French law, the option for the debtor to limit the effects of the new accelerated safeguard to financial creditors remains, provided that the nature of its liabilities is such that a plan is likely to only concern and to be adopted by financial creditors. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor’s accounts have been certified by an auditor or endorsed by a certificate from the certified public accountant; - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to ensure that it is likely to be adopted within the time limit provided for under article L. 628-8 of the French Commercial Code. Accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees). The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. The observation period may have an initial duration of two months and may be renewed once for another period of two months. The maximum duration of the observation period is therefore four months. The aim is to find a quick remedy for the debtor. If the plan is not adopted within the required time limit, the proceedings will automatically terminate and the court will not be able to impose a term-out. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. Classes of affected parties have to be mandatorily constituted in accelerated safeguard proceedings (unlike in standard safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings) and are required to vote on the proposed plan. If the 323 ----- plan is rejected by one or several classes, the court will be entitled, under certain conditions, to resort to a crossclass cram down (see “—Classes of affected parties-based consultation—Cross-class cram down” above). The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in the classes of affected parties-based consultation of standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt write-offs and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). The mechanism of cross-class cram down is also applicable. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, no debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed on the creditors by the court. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor (or, in its absence, attested by its chartered accountant) shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below). _Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_ Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. Within 45 days of becoming insolvent, the debtor, if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above), is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), a controller, the Public Prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_ reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers and the social and economic committee (if any), and after having obtained the opinion of the Public Prosecutor. The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a draft judicial reorganization plan with the contribution of the debtor, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the Public Prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. 324 ----- As in safeguard proceedings and contrary to accelerated safeguard proceedings, classes of affected parties are only mandatory in judicial reorganization proceedings if the debtor, alone or together with its subsidiaries, has 250 employees and a net turn-over of at least €20 million, or a net turn-over of at least €40 million. However, below those thresholds, the court may permit classes to be constituted at the request of the debtor. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, the main differences with the rules applicable in safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings are the following: - any affected party is entitled to propose an alternative restructuring plan; - the cram down of classes may be implemented with the agreement of the debtor or an affected party, which significantly enhances the value of the cross-class cram down mechanism for senior creditors; and - if no plan is eventually approved, the court will be entitled to term-out the creditors over a 10-year period. In such a case, no instalment shall be lower than 5% after the third year and lower than 10% after the sixth year. In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business as described below. Any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) can present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the Public Prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. 325 ----- If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management (although they remain in place). Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already appointed, to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) (during which the rules of the observation period will generally apply) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale of the business plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; or - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: o launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); o sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervising judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or o request, under the supervision of the supervising judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a sale of the business plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. _Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are deemed null and void (and consequently not enforceable against the debtor), as well as, according to a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, No. 12-22.909, “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (which should also apply in case of safeguard or accelerated safeguard). The courtappointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. The court-appointed administrator can, on the contrary, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations although the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that it fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (in case of 326 ----- reorganization proceedings, any payment by the debtor during the observation period with respect to continued contracts shall be made immediately (paiement au comptant) absent agreement with the other party). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale of the business plan (as described above); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the sale of the business plan or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. In any event, upon opening of the proceedings immediate payment of the unpaid amount of the share capital will be demanded from the shareholders. In addition, during the observation period: - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for a term of at least one year, or contracts providing for a payment that is differed by at least one year); and accrued interests of preinsolvency claims cannot be compounded (notwithstanding article 1343-2 of the French Civil Code); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the set-off of related debts (créances connexes) and payments authorized by the supervising judge appointed by the Court to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business; - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed trustees within one year of the expiry of the observation period; and - creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor provided such guarantor is an individual) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is: o to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); o to terminate a contract for non-payment of pre-petition amounts owed to the creditor; or o to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor subject to a few exceptions, including (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution _judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, movable_ or immovable—is located in another Member State within the European Union at the time of the opening of the insolvency proceedings, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are open in such member state). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France (and the EU) would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party). Under accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings. See “—Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard.” As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post- commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. In the case where 327 ----- the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. When a proof of claim is made on behalf of a creditor, such creditor is allowed to ratify it or, if he wishes so, to replace it by filing its own proof of claim. Creditors who have not submitted their proofs of claims during the relevant period are, except with respect to limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are unenforceable against the debtor if the debtor complies with the plan’s provisions. Employees do not need to file a proof of claim in respect of their wage-related claims and are preferred creditors under French law. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debts held by creditors who took part in the conciliation negotiation are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its chartered accountant). Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four months’ time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be party to the classes of affected parties) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time limit. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business plan in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of their claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees (for the super-privileged part of their claims), post-petition legal costs (essentially, fees of the officials appointed by the insolvency court), creditors who benefit from the New Money Lien or the Post Money Privilege certain prepetition secured creditors secured by real estate in judicial liquidation proceedings only, post-petition privileged creditors, the French State (taxes and social charges), other pre-petition secured creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors. Some creditors may nevertheless bypass this order of priority, _e.g. it does not apply to creditors benefitting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset. _The “Suspect Period” in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_ The cash flow insolvency date (date de “cessation des paiements”) is generally deemed to be the date on which the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, but the court may declare that a debtor’s insolvency date occurred up to 18 months prior to the commencement date of such proceedings (but no prior to the final court order sanctioning a conciliation agreement (homologation), except in cases of fraud). This marks the beginning of the “suspect period” (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the suspect period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include essentially transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for debts (including a security granted to secure a guarantee obligation) previously incurred and provisional attachment or seizure measures, unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency (cessation de _paiements), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie)_ (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), and any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as a guaranty of pre-existing debts, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité). Transactions voidable by the court include payments made on accrued debts, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the suspect period, if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew (or could not ignore) the insolvency (cessation de paiements) of the debtor. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect 328 ----- period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.” There is, in theory, no suspect period prior to the commencement of safeguard (as the debtor must not be insolvent) and of accelerated safeguard proceedings (assuming the proceedings are successful). _Extension of Insolvency Proceedings_ French law provides that, upon the petition of the debtor, the Public Prosecutor, the judicial administrator, the liquidator or the creditors’ representative, the insolvency proceedings of a company may be extended to another one, so that their respective assets and liabilities will be treated as belonging to one single insolvency estate, if (i) the debtor company is deemed “fictitious,” i.e., a sham, or (ii) the debtor company “commingled its assets and liabilities” with another entity, i.e., either it proves impossible to determine which assets and liabilities belong to each of them or “abnormal financial relationships” existed between the two entities (such as transfers of assets or funds without consideration). _Protective Measures under Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization and Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Protective measures may be taken by the President of the Court on the assets of de facto or de jure managers against whom a liability action for shortfall of assets has been launched in judicial liquidation proceedings. In addition, protective measures may be requested: - in the context of a legal action to extend the insolvency to a third party (on the grounds mentioned above), against the defendant; and - over the assets of the de facto or de jure manager of a company subject to judicial reorganization proceedings and against whom an action for liability is brought on the grounds of a wrongdoing having contributed to the debtor’s insolvency (cessation des paiements). Such protective measure can be maintained in judicial liquidation proceedings. These protective measures aim at precluding third parties from seizing the assets of the company against which an action for extension of the insolvency proceedings is brought or the assets of the manager against which an action for liability is brought. _Creditors’ Liability_ Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code, where insolvency proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud; (ii) interfered with the management of the debtor or (iii) obtained security or guarantees which are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to secure facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (dirigeant de fait). In such a case, article L 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for the debts of the company, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount. However, a manager (whether de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code in cases of “simple negligence” (simple négligence) in the management of the company. _Fraudulent Conveyance_ French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of insolvency proceedings, the so-called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of the safeguard 329 ----- or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) in insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant person (if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the claim was lodged by such creditor) if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the concerned creditor or, in the case of a claim lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the New Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of a Guarantee or Collateral involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the New Notes or the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral could be (i) declared unenforceable against all the creditors if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or (ii) declared unenforceable against the creditor that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act in accordance with article 1341-2 of the French Civil Code. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the New Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the New Notes, the Guarantees, the security interests in the Collateral or the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the New Notes received with respect to the New Notes, the Guarantees, the security interests in the Collateral or the Collateral could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the New Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the New Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.7,Germany,256.7.1,Insolvency,"Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered office in Germany (together, the “German Guarantors” and each a “German Guarantor”). There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interests” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors, is likely to be initiated in Germany, and, if a German Guarantor were held to have its “centre of main interests” within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of a Guarantor that is not organized under the laws of Germany (for example, if its “centre of main interests” is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency proceedings over a Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of the recovery of payments due on the New Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If a Guarantor’s “centre of main interests” is situated in a foreign country (other than a Member State), the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings or secondary insolvency proceedings by a German court will be determined by section 354 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in case of territorial insolvency proceedings or sections 356 _et seq. of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in case of secondary insolvency proceedings. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant 330 ----- entity and certain other requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within a group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. German insolvency law provides for rules facilitating the mastering of group insolvencies. However, they mainly relate to coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. They do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulate four key pillars in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity in insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination _proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination _insolvency_ _administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag). Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve (12) months (positive _Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due_ and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditors to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder—such_ as the German Guarantors—becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of over indebtedness at the latest within six (6) weeks after over indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management (and any other person obliged to file for insolvency, as the case may be) to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the New Notes, may be voidable; this may also apply, under certain conditions, to certain payments before the occurrence of illiquidity or over-indebtedness. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor. Insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag), the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may, _inter alia, prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce judicially individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as debtor-in-possession proceedings requires, inter alia, that (i) the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent self-administration planning (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) and (ii) no circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on inaccurate facts. In case of debtor-in-possession status is ordered, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) will be appointed who shall supervise the management of the debtor in the preliminary insolvency proceedings with debtor-in-possession status (vorläufige _Eigenverwaltung)._ 331 ----- Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to order debtor-in-possession status and if the debtor can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer with experience in insolvency matters) that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, grant a period of up to three (3) months for submission of an insolvency plan (so-called protective shield proceedings, Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the debtor—be suspended. The preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) will supervise the process. In this sub-variant of debtor-inpossession proceedings, the debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as preliminary custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’ committee will be asked to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which regularly includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des _Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse)_ to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession status, the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, businessexperienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). From the perspective of the Noteholders, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - if the court does not order debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the assets of such insolvent entity would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); - if the court does not order debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; 332 ----- - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of such insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator to the extent an insolvency administrator refuses to voluntarily separate such asset from the estate. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to an agreement to terminate such agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder _Lösungsklauseln) may—pursuant to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof)_ highly dependent on the individual circumstances—be invalid if they frustrate the right of the insolvency administrator to choose whether or not to perform the agreement (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters). This likely also relates to agreements which are not governed by German law. Powers of attorney granted by a debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) opts for performance. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Security interests in the debtor’s assets obtained by way of judicial enforcement action in the last month prior to the request for opening of insolvency proceedings or after such date shall become ineffective upon opening of the proceedings. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the insolvency estate it may depend on the circumstances whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has the right to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. A recent decision by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) pertaining to enforcement of intellectual property rights (transferred as security) can be read to grant secured creditors the enforcement right in case of non-securitized (unverbriefte) shares (such as typically is the case with shares in a German GmbH). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors remaining after 333 ----- realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right for purposes of the continuation of the debtor’s business. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Kosten des _Insolvenzverfahrens) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger)._ Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator (or debtor and custodian in case of debtorin-possession proceedings) after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). It may take several years before an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors. In insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims of the Noteholders against such German Guarantor under the Guarantees would only rank as unsecured insolvency claim. German insolvency law also provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law. The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the unsubordinated claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or entered into a legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent entity. In that event, in insolvency proceedings over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed, inter alia, to an avoidance risk with respect to repayments made within the period of one (1) year prior to the petition to open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such petition (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (and, as the case may be, in transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from transaction security (if any) were deemed to be a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the value of the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors can, under certain circumstances, be crammed down). The debtor as insolvent entity may 334 ----- oppose the proposed plan, but can be crammed down if the plan is not detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to ordinary insolvency proceedings) and if no creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can, under certain circumstances, also be crammed down.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten (10) years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Guarantor or any other entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the Noteholders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support (such as the Guarantees) for the benefit of the New Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., avoidance rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of insolvency avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event and to the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the Noteholders may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the New Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditors only. If payments have already been made under the New Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that were to be voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the Noteholders would only have a general unsecured claim under the New Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the 335 ----- filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or has paid for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four (4) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten (10) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; knowledge of the beneficiary of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors is presumed if the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s imminent insolvency (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the other creditors. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four (4) years. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was entitled in that form and at that time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors is (only) presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor, or agreed to deferred payments, establishes the presumption that he or she had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management board or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last ten (10) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” (Bargeschäft) and may as such be privileged, i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to insolvency avoidance under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order 336 ----- (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) in the absence of formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (as amended from time to time, the “Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act”) (Gesetz über den _Stabilisierungs- und Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und - restrukturierungsgesetz - StaRUG)), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-insolvency_ financial restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). A debtor’s management can (but is not obliged to) access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the company is imminently illiquid. Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort), only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the New Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite becoming binding on all affected creditors. The tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately; however, certain tools may be extended to cover security granted by entities that are affiliated entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor. Furthermore, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act replicates the tools available under the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies. The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for example, by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates or maturities of liabilities as well as capital measures pertaining to the equity structure. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) the Guarantees and Collateral granted for the benefit of the New Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtor’s creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely by the debtor will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of at least 75% of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are generally determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if certain creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided that certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross class _cramdown). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the_ debtor can be included in the restructuring plan (e.g., capital decrease with subsequent capital increase and provisions on the subscription right). In this case, the adoption of the restructuring plan generally also requires the 337 ----- consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can, under certain circumstances, also be crammed down. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which can be granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three (3) months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight (8) months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the Noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other entity having its “center of main interests” in Germany would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight (8) months due to a stabilization order upon application by the debtor; - any claims and rights of the Noteholders and their Collateral can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra group guarantees and collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective guarantees and collateral, respectively; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Noteholder without the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority requirement is 75% of the respective voting rights) and, if the prerequisites for a cross class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Noteholders. Restructuring Proceedings which are public and corresponding restructuring plans confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation as such public Restructuring Proceedings have been included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of said Regulation. In any other case (i.e., “private” Restructuring Proceedings), recognition of a restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable conflict-of-laws provisions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.7,Germany,256.7.4,Accessory Security Interests and Parallel Debt,"Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require that the security holder and the creditor of the secured claim be identical. Therefore, pledges may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest and other accessory interests. Such accessory security interests (i) cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee who does not itself hold the secured claim, (ii) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated and (iii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The accessory security interests will be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the New Notes. The Noteholders on the other hand are creditors under the New Notes and the Guarantees, but will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the Noteholders from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Security Documents will secure, in particular, a so called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than securing the claims of the Noteholders directly. The pledges governed by German law will therefore directly secure, in particular, the parallel debt. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by a debtor under, in particular, the New Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture, and any payment in respect of the 338 ----- principal obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount due under the New Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt. Although it is widely believed that a parallel debt can effectively be secured by a pledge, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of a parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. Moreover, the Security Agent does not hold the pledges or the parallel debt in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Noteholders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

If, at the time of entering into a security agreement, it is already certain that the realizable value of the_ collateral is significantly out of proportion to the claim secured, the entire German collateral could be regarded as an initially excessive collateralization. Although no specific case law exists, a decision by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) indicates that the loan-to-collateral ratio would be beyond the threshold applied to subsequent excessive collateralization if the value of the collateral is more than 150% of the amount of the secured obligations. Any valuation, however, will be based on the realizable value taking into account any possible discount on the current market value, arising, e.g., from a sale in the then current situation. In addition, the over-collateralization, in order to be regarded as initially excessive, must be based on a creditor’s reprobate attitude (verwerfliche Gesinnung), which is assumed if a creditor, out of self-interest, displays an ethically unbearable recklessness against a debtor. In exceptional circumstances, an excessive loan-to-collateral ratio can, itself, justify the assumption of a reprobate attitude. If the realizable value of the collateral at any date after having been granted not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured claims by more than 10%, the subsequently excessively secured (nachträglich übersichert) creditor is, according to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), regularly obliged to release collateral back to the debtor insofar as the estimated realizable value of collateral, which depends on the risks of realization of the collateral and on the market situation, exceeds the secured claim amount by more than such 10%. In order to determine the realizable value of the collateral granted, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) allows for a reduction of the face value of the collateral, thus, permitting that the face value of the collateral is up to 150% of the claim amounts secured from time to time. In case and to the extent that the realizable value of the aggregate collateral exceeds 110% of the secured obligations, the secured creditor would, on demand by the collateral provider, have to release excess collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

KG”), respectively. The granting of a Guarantee or Collateral by such German Guarantor in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company (each such German Guarantor, a “German Subsidiary Guarantor”) is subject to certain provisions relating to the preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply to any future guarantor or security grantor incorporated in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG. As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s, or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG its general partner’s, net assets (i.e., in principle total assets less liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial 339 ----- Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) would fall below the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced. The granting of a Guarantee or security interest by a German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are not at arm’s length terms may be considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG. In addition, Section 15b paragraph 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (“Section 15b InsO”) prohibits the managing directors (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH to make payments to the shareholders leading to the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the GmbH. Payments towards a guarantee as well as share pledges and any other collateral granted by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered payments to its shareholders in the meaning of Section 15b InsO. This also applies to limited partnerships with a limited liability company as general partner such as a GmbH & Co. KG. In order to enable a German subsidiary incorporated in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to grant guarantees and to provide collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating the provisions of the GmbHG and/or Section 15b InsO and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, security documents, indentures and/or guarantees to contain so called “limitation language” in relation to such subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the secured parties contractually agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce the security interests and the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to demand payment under the guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement and payment, respectively, do not result in the subsidiary’s or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG in the general partner’s, net assets falling below the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or increasing such shortfall in order to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the GmbHG or—with regard to Section 15b InsO—in the relevant German Subsidiary Guarantor becoming illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) within the current or subsequent fiscal year and the managing director(s) of the German Subsidiary Guarantor becoming liable pursuant to Section 15b InsO. Accordingly, the documentation with respect to the Collateral and the Guarantees, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain such contractual limitation language and such guarantees and security interests are limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or Collateral granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor can only be enforced to a limited extent or not at all and the Noteholders will lose the benefit of the Guarantees and Collateral, respectively. German capital maintenance, liquidity protection rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect (i) the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the New Notes, (ii) the ability of a German Subsidiary Guarantor to make payments on the Guarantees or (iii) the ability of the secured parties to enforce the Collateral. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantees or Collateral granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantees and/or Collateral by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction (for example, a Noteholder) qualifying as a repayment of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Guarantees and the Collateral, respectively, could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of “contra bonos mores” (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary Guarantor when granting the 340 ----- Guarantees and/or the Collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such circumstances, the Guarantees or the Collateral may also be invalid. German law does not generally permit for the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event in relation to the pledge. The enforcement of a share/interest pledge governed by German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the relevant German Subsidiary Guarantor from foreclosing into and realizing the assets constituting the Collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds from such realization, but not an intervention right (Drittwiderspruchsrecht) (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). Accordingly, the Security Agent and the Noteholders may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other (unsecured) creditors into the Collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely.

As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast **Insolvency Regulation”) as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by UK domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA. On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a Member State, including for the purpose of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a Member State. The Recast Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and paragraph 1, schedule 5, European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the Recast Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the Recast Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the UK; or - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. 341 ----- These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the English court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration. While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of _English insolvency and restructuring proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator may also dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the consent of the secured creditors. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”) (see further below). If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment 343 ----- could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the New Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. The New Notes are not secured by a floating charge. In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29 of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court may grant an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. 344 ----- The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Regulations 2003), as set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

If appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge that falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce 345 ----- the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realise on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, amongst other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors could be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved by the creditors, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of Companies (in the case of UK companies, for the purpose of registration). A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings. 346 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted on in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. A CVA also requires the approval of more than 50% in value of the company’s members present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the outcome of the meeting of members differs from the outcome of the meeting of creditors, the decision of the creditors will prevail. Like creditors, members have the right to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances.

While CA06 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired.

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the Register of Companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The English court has jurisdiction to wind up a company through compulsory liquidation if it is a company registered in England and Wales, or if it is a foreign company (i) with its COMI in England and Wales, or (ii) with its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales, or (iii) in the case of an unregistered foreign company, if (a) it has enough of a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the English court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up through compulsory liquidation, (b) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefits to those applying for the winding-up order and (c) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the English court can exercise a jurisdiction. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an Member State (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a 348 ----- “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once the winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): 349 ----- - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge; - Seventh ranking: o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; o secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the New Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the New Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. 350 ----- This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.

In most cases this will only arise if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it. _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests: _Transaction at an undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee 351 ----- (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees, although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the court in relation to a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue). However, the court will only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency). 352 ----- _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the New Notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Grant of floating charge_ Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. 353 ----- However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis. As referred to above (see “—Fixed and floating charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterized as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently recharacterized has been granted within the relevant suspect period referred to above, this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration provided.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the UK. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations, certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or liquidation and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: (a) _Moratorium The CIGA 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. 354 ----- Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The CIGA 2020 includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration, administrative _receivership and floating charges,” “—Avoidance of transactions—Grant of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security_ charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and 355 ----- - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). (b) _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited The CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. (c) _Restructuring plan The CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under CA06, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in 356 ----- respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e., what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.

If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of CA06 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which was implemented in the UK via the CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit a stay may be requested from the English court). Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the New Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date and the New Notes will be secured by security interests over the Collateral on or about the Issue Date. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the New Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

In addition,",256.10.1,,"recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position). 358 ----- _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in Member States. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a Member State. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. 359 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

A Noteholder will also have a Substantial Interest in the Issuer or any Dutch Guarantor if one of certain relatives of that holder or of his or her partner has a Substantial Interest in the Issuer or Dutch Guarantor. If a Noteholder does not have a Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if (part of) a Substantial Interest has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without recognizing a taxable gain. _Dutch Resident Individuals_ A Noteholder who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands, or who opts to be taxed as a resident of The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a “Dutch Resident Individual”), will generally be subject to Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the New Notes at progressive rates up to 49.50% (maximum rate for 2024) if: (i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the New Notes are attributable or deemed to be attributable; or (ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the New Notes that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden, as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001)), which include the performance of activities with respect to the New Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief _vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang)._ If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, pursuant to the regime for income from savings and investments, regardless of the actual income and/or capital gains derived from the New Notes. As of January 1, 2023, transitional legislation applies to determine the income from savings and investments based on a deemed return, until a new system will be implemented based on the actual return (envisaged to enter into force as of 2027). Under this transitional regime, the taxable income from savings and investments is calculated by multiplying the individual’s deemed return percentage (effectieve rendementspercentage) by the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag) exceeding a personal threshold (heffingvrij vermogen) of €57,000 (2024) (grondslag _sparen en beleggen). The individual’s deemed return percentage is calculated on the basis of the actual_ composition of the individual’s yield basis (determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities) as of January 1 of the relevant year (subject to certain rules against reference date arbitration; _peildatumarbitrage), with separate (periodically announced) deemed return percentages applying for bank deposits (banktegoeden), other investments (overige bezittingen) and debts (schulden). As of January 1, 2024, the deemed return percentage for other investments, which includes the New Notes, is set at 6.04%. However, on June 6, 2024, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in a number of cases that application of the aforementioned transitional regime violates the principle of non-discrimination and the fundamental right to property if the deemed return applicable to the savings and investments exceeds the actual return in the respective calendar year. In the ruling, the Dutch Supreme Court gives detailed rules for calculating the actual return and such amount should be taken into account for tax purposes if the taxpayer substantiates that it is lower than the deemed return. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no legislative changes have been 362 ----- proposed by the Dutch legislator in response to the June 6, 2024 rulings. The deemed and actual return on savings and investments is taxed at a rate of 36% (rate for 2024). _Dutch Resident Entities_ A Noteholder that is an entity (including an association, partnership or mutual fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity) and that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a “Dutch Resident Entity”) will generally be subject to Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the New Notes. The Dutch corporate income tax rate is 19% for the first €200,000 of the taxable profits and 25.8% for the taxable amount exceeding €200,000 (rates for 2024). _Non-Dutch Residents_ A Noteholder who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch Resident Entity (a “Non**Dutch Resident”) is generally not subject to Dutch income or Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the New Notes, provided that: (i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case may be, the New Notes are attributable or deemed attributable; (ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or capital gains from the New Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from “miscellaneous activities” performed in The Netherlands (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden _in Nederland, as defined the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001), which include the performance of_ activities with respect to the New Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang); (iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the New Notes or payments in respect of the New Notes are attributable; and (iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity (including an association, partnership or mutual fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity), such entity is neither entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the New Notes or payments in respect of the New Notes are attributable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

IPO Pushdown","We believe that an IPO Pushdown should not result in a taxable exchange of the New Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary position. If an IPO Pushdown is treated as resulting in a taxable exchange of the New Notes for United States federal income tax purposes, you may recognize gain or loss on the New Notes that you hold at such time (although any such loss may be disallowed) equal to the difference, if any, between the issue price of the deemed newly issued New Notes (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the New Notes, and have a new holding period and tax basis in the New Notes. Any such gain or loss would be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of New Notes.” In addition, if the fair market value of the New Notes at the time of such taxable exchange were lower than their stated principal amount by an amount equal to or greater than a statutory de minimis amount, the New Notes would generally be treated as newly issued with original issue discount for United States federal income tax 365 ----- purposes, in which case you would generally be required to include the original issue discount in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, on a constant yield to maturity basis, in advance of the receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,312,TAX CONSIDERATIONS,312.3,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,312.3.2,Payments of stated interest,"Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, stated interest on a New Note (including any non-U.S. tax withheld and additional amounts paid in respect thereof) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the New Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain conditions and limitations (including a minimum holding period requirement), any non-U.S. withholding taxes on interest may be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. For foreign tax credit purposes, interest (including any additional amounts) on a New Note will be treated as foreign source income and will generally constitute passive category income. However, if you are eligible for the benefits of an applicable treaty, any withholding taxes on interest from the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction will not be creditable against your United States federal income tax liability to the extent withheld at a rate exceeding the applicable rate under the applicable treaty. In addition, U.S. Treasury regulations addressing foreign tax credits (the “Foreign Tax Credit Regulations”) impose additional requirements for foreign taxes to be eligible for a foreign tax credit, and unless you are eligible for and elect to claim the benefits of an applicable treaty, there can be no assurance that those requirements will be satisfied. The Department of Treasury and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to the Foreign Tax Credit Regulations. In addition, recent notices from the IRS provide temporary relief by allowing taxpayers that comply with applicable requirements to apply many aspects of the foreign tax credit regulations as they previously existed (before the release of the current Foreign Tax Credit Regulations) for taxable years ending before the date that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is issued (or any later date specified in such notice or other guidance). Instead of claiming a foreign tax credit, you may be able to deduct any non-U.S. withholding taxes on interest in computing your taxable income, subject to generally applicable limitations under United States federal income tax law (including that a U.S. holder is not eligible for a deduction for otherwise creditable foreign income taxes paid or accrued in a taxable year if such U.S. holder claims a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued in the same taxable year). The rules governing the foreign tax credit and deductions for foreign taxes are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the Foreign Tax Credit Regulations (and the related temporary relief in the IRS notices) and the availability of the foreign tax credit or a deduction under your particular circumstances. Interest on the New Notes will be payable in euro. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest received on the New Notes, determined by translating the amount of euro received at the spot rate for euro on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of euro so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the New Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the New Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate for euro on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year) or the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a New Note (including, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a New Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize United States source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating 366 ----- the amount of euro received at the spot rate for euro on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Your adjusted tax basis in a New Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased a New Note with euro, your U.S. dollar cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount of euro paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a cash method or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the New Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for euro, then your amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount of euro received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash method or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, if the New Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). If an accrual method U.S. holder makes the special election to use the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the purchase (in determining its U.S. dollar cost) or disposition (in determining its amount realized) of a New Note, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method U.S. holder that does not make the special election generally will recognize exchange gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a New Note for euro to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the New Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a New Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the New Note is your purchase price for the New Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss realized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the New Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the New Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the New Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the New Notes that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive allocations of the New Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the New Notes. In connection with the Offering, BofA Securities Europe SA (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the New Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the New Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over allot the 371 ----- Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase New Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the New Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the New Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks _related to the New Notes, our Structure and our Indebtedness—There may not be an active trading market for the New Notes, in which case your ability to sell the New Notes may be limited.”_ No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the New Notes and the Guarantees or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Group or the New Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the New Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the New Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the resale of the New Notes. See “Notice to _Investors—Notice to U.S. Investors.”_ The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the New Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the New Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling or distributing the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the New Notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the New Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the New Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the New Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the New Notes (an “EEA **Distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, an EEA Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the New Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the New Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the New Notes is only eligible 372 ----- counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR and (ii) all channels for distribution of the New Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the New Notes (a “UK Distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a UK Distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the New Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales of any New Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the New Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law. The New Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer will apply to list the New Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and to admit them to trading on such stock exchange; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that the New Notes will be listed or admitted to trading on the Exchange. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they presently intend to make a market in the New Notes after completion of the Offering as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The Initial Purchasers are not obliged, however, to make a market in the New Notes and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. The Issuer and Guarantors cannot guarantee the liquidity of the trading market for the New Notes. If an active trading market for the New Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the New Notes may be adversely affected. If the New Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, the Group’s operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. The Issuer expects that the delivery of the New Notes will be made on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the “T+     ” business day following the date of pricing of the New Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the New Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding      business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the New Notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the New Notes who wish to trade the New Notes on the date of pricing should consult their advisors. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have from time to time provided certain investment banking and/or other financial services to the Issuer and its affiliates or former affiliates, including, without limitation, hedging activities, for which they received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may in the future provide investment banking or other financial services to the Issuer or its affiliates, for which they will receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In addition, the Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain costs and expenses incurred. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold the 2025 Notes or the 2026 Notes, which are being redeemed in full. To the extent the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates hold any 2025 Notes or 2026 Notes, they may receive payment in connection with the redemption of the 2025 Notes or 2026 Notes, as applicable. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are acting as arrangers under the Amended Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may enter into hedging arrangements with the Issuer and/or its affiliates. In connection with their services in such capacities, such Initial Purchasers or affiliates will receive customary fees and commissions. Funds advised by KKR that hold an indirect controlling interest in the Issuer are affiliates of KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Ltd, which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the Offering. KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Ltd may therefore be deemed to be our affiliate and the interests of KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Ltd may not coincide with your interests. We have engaged KKR to provide certain financial consulting services in connection with this Offering. In addition, we may pay distributions to our shareholders from time to time in accordance with our distribution practices and any applicable restrictions, which may include affiliates of KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Ltd. 373 ----- From time to time, certain Initial Purchasers, or certain of their affiliates, also engage in securities trading and brokerage activities with respect to securities of the Group and its subsidiaries and affiliates. An affiliate of an Initial Purchaser has provided hedging arrangements to the Issuer, which arrangements are expected to remain in place following the Issue Date. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Hedging Arrangements.” In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad arrange of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer’s affiliates. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us and may hedge their creditor exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the New Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the New Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive allocations of the New Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the New Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 374 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in The Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and The Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without substantive re-examination or re-litigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground, and (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in The Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in The Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in The Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in The Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in The Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of The Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the U.S.; 381 ----- - the subject matter of such U.S. judgment is sufficiently or substantially connected with the jurisdiction of the court that rendered it, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over such matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including the fair trial rights. It should be noted in this respect that the scope and content of French international public policy are not precisely or exhaustively defined under French law and are determined by French courts on a case-by-case basis and may vary in time; - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment (in this latter case, exequatur proceedings may be stayed). If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (Loi de blocage) and Order No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons). Order No. 2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and Order of the Ministry of Economy of March 7, 2022 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) as well as French law No. 2018-670 related to the protection of trade secrets, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as most recently modified by laws No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 (adopting the provisions relating to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the EU Law Enforcement Directive (EU 2016/680)) and No. 2018-699 August 3, 2018 and by French Ordinance No. 2018-1125 of December 12, 2018 and Decree No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. If an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) contravenes French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts) or in case of applicable overriding mandatory rules. In an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. Federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts (article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French court’s jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, the French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code. There are diverging positions amongst the chambers of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) regarding the validity of a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction. French case-law has previously ruled that a unilateral jurisdiction clause granting one party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction without specifying the objective basis on which this alternative jurisdiction is founded was contrary to the 382 ----- objectives of foreseeability and legal certainty of Article 23 of the Lugano Convention. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents may not be binding over the party submitted court. Any document which is not in the French language may be required to be translated into French for the purpose of any proceedings brought before a French court in respect thereof (although such translations do not need to be made before the relevant proceedings are commenced). As indicated above (see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and _Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”), there is a risk that the accession documents, the Security Documents,_ the Guarantee or the obligations of the French Guarantor under the finance documents do not comply with the Toubon Law. Therefore, there would be a risk that French courts, considering that the Toubon Law constitutes a French international public policy rule, refuse to recognize or enforce a U.S. judgment ordering the enforcement of the Guarantee and/or accession documents and/or Security Documents against the French Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.3,Germany,145.3.1,,"Civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States may, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts, not be enforceable in Germany. The enforceability of U.S. judgments in Germany is subject to an action to be brought before a German court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the procedures set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, under applicable legal rules, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. However, under current rules as presently applied by German courts, a final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. court for a definite sum of money, will be recognized and thereby given binding effect within the territory of Germany, unless the German court finds that, inter alia, the recognition of the U.S. judgment leads to a result manifestly irreconcilable with material principles of German law or that proper legal procedures have not been observed. Specifically, the recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is to be denied if one or more of the following circumstances exist: - the judgment is not final under U.S. law; or - U.S. courts would not have had jurisdiction over the case based on the principles on jurisdictional competences under German law; or - the defendant did not appear in the proceedings and invokes such lack of appearance, and the document introducing the proceedings was not duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; or - the judgment conflicts with (i) any prior judgment rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment rendered by another foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; or - the proceedings resulting in the judgment to be recognized are irreconcilable with previously pending proceedings in a German court; or - the recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court would be in conflict with German public policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); or - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities, such as the holders of the New Notes, may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium, as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. It should be noted that German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount 383 ----- of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. It is uncertain whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. federal and state law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. As far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may compel the extensive production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses prior to trial. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor a final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in the same matter in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment inconsistent with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States, but the latitude to deviate from the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely new decision if there are grounds for non-recognition under Section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must otherwise take the foreign decision into account, i.e., the foreign judgment has a certain binding effect.",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
361,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.4,England and Wales,145.4.1,,"The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that the defense to it has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason for trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; 384 ----- - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in civil and commercial matters. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. 385 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605

The company is filed with the Trade Register at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68805934. The activities of Q-Park Holding B.V. and its Group companies primarily consist of providing off-street and on-street parking services at strategic locations. The company's shares are not listed on any stock exchange. All amounts are in EUR millions unless stated otherwise. Q-Park Holding B.V.'s condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and more specifically Dutch Accounting Standard 394 - Interim reports. ### Group structure Q-Park Holding B.V. is the head of the Group of legal entities included in the consolidation. The Company's direct shareholder is Byzantium Acquisition MidCo 1 B.V. registered at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68802641. The ultimate shareholders of the Company are a consortium consisting of investment funds advised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (London, United Kingdom), Eureizen (Paris, France), PensionDanmark Pensionsforsikringsaktieselskab (Copenhagen, Denmark), Euro-Parking Investments S.à r.l. (Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and Babylon Investments B.V. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). ### Going concern The ongoing geopolitical unrest and the inflationary environment in Europe continued to lead to elevated economic uncertainty. Although we are not directly impacted by the war and conflict, we have experienced the effects of increasing prices, labour costs and CPI related indexation of our lease portfolio. The impact of these price and cost increases on the year-to-date results was offset by our pricing initiatives and increased visitor volumes. As such we did not experience a material impact of these developments on our performance. The main uncertainty is linked to consumer behaviour and impact on the parking business when general price increases result in a decrease in GDP growth and consumer spending. As of the preparation date of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, it is difficult to assess this potential risk. However, we have not yet seen a negative impact of this uncertainty on consumer parking behaviour. The year-to-date results and current economic developments in combination with the liquidity position available give us the comfort that the Group has sufficient means to deal with these remaining uncertainties. The consolidated interim financial statements were therefore prepared based on going concern assumptions. We do, however, continue to monitor our financial structure and have initiated discussions on the refinancing of the notes tranche due in 2026. ----- # 2 Significant accounting policies ### General The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in euros. The euro is the presentation currency as well as the functional currency of Q-Park Holding B.V. Each entity within the Group recognises transactions and balance sheet items in its own functional currency. ### Consolidation Financial information relating to Group companies and other legal entities controlled by Q-Park Holding B.V. or where central management is conducted has been consolidated in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Q-Park Holding B.V. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies as applied by Q-Park Holding B.V. in their consolidated annual accounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Financial information relating to the Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation is fully included in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, eliminating the intercompany relationships and transactions. The results of newly acquired Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation are consolidated as from the acquisition date. On that date the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value. If the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, this is goodwill which is capitalised and amortised over the expected useful life. ### Foreign currencies Receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are converted at the prevailing exchange rates as per balance sheet date. Foreign exchange rate differences arising are incorporated in the condensed consolidated income statement. The income statements from the Group companies registered abroad are converted at the average exchange rate for the period of the condensed consolidated income statement. The net result from these Group companies is converted at the exchange rate prevailing at balance sheet date. The difference between these two conversions is accounted for in the shareholders' equity (statutory exchange rate differences reserve). Assets and liabilities of a Group company incorporated abroad are converted at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date for the purposes of consolidation. Foreign exchange rate differences that arise are directly deducted from or added to, after deduction of deferred tax effects, the Group equity and recognised in the statutory exchange rate differences reserve. Likewise, this also applies to the translation differences on loans that form part of the net investment in the foreign operations. ----- Overview of the exchange rates used as compared to the presentation currency (Euro) for drawing up the condensed interim financial statements: March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Average End Average End Average End British pound (GBP) 1.1679 1.1695 1.1497 1.1507 1.1323 1.1374 Danish crown (DKK) 0.1341 0.1341 0.1342 0.1342 0.1344 0.1343 ### Estimates in the condensed interim financial statements When applying the Group’s accounting policies, it is necessary to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The most important of these estimates are explained as follows. At balance sheet date Q-Park Holding B.V. determines whether there are any indicators that goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and/or tangible fixed assets are impaired. If and when indicators are identified, an impairment calculation is performed and if applicable an impairment result is recognised. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The provision for onerous contracts is determined based on an estimate of future cash flows and losses. These cash flow projections and the related onerous contract provision are reassessed on a quarterly basis based on the actual cash flow developments of the most recent reporting period and other developments impacting the estimation. There is some uncertainty regarding the explanation of complex tax regulations and the tax effects of the acquisition and financing structure of Q-Park. Considering the wide range of international business relationships and the long-running and complex nature of existing contractual agreements, differences may arise between the assumptions made and the actual results, or future changes in such assumptions may influence the actual results. Deferred tax assets related to unused tax losses are recognised insofar as it is probable that profit for tax purposes will be available to which this can be offset. In order to determine the value of the deferred tax assets arising from tax losses not offset, a management assessment is required regarding the probable timing and level of the future taxable profits, combined with future fiscal planning strategies. ----- ### Business combination The purchase accounting method is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises: ### I fair values of the assets transferred; I liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business; I equity interests issued by the Group; I net present value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share in the fair value of the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities. Acquisition-related costs are capitalised as part of the purchase price. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, adjusted for any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value against the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds at the date of exchange. A contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. ### Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets are presented at cost less accumulated amortisation and, if applicable, less impairments in value. Amortisation is charged as a fixed percentage of cost. The expected useful life and the amortisation method are reassessed at the end of each financial year. Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period between 5 to 20 years. This period is derived from the long-term business profile and cash flows from the underlying assets (owned and leased parking facilities). Concessions The concessions relate to all investments in French parking facilities involving a (finite) concession for the use of the ground and facility. The concessions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the underlying concession contracts with an assumed residual value of nil. Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets consist of the corporate trade name and other intangible fixed assets (mainly software). The corporate trade name is capitalised as part of business combinations at fair value on acquisition date. The other intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life with an assumed residual value of nil. The following table shows an indication of the useful life per asset category: Categories Percentage Trade name 5% Software and other 20% ----- ### Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at the cost price less accumulated depreciation and, if applicable, less impairments in value. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is based on linear depreciation over the expected period in use and taking the expected residual value into account. Depreciation commences on the date an asset comes into use. The following table shows an indication of the assessed useful economic life and depreciation percentages applied to the different fixed asset categories. Categories Percentage Buildings 2% - 3% Leasehold improvements 5% - 10% Parking equipment and installations 10% - 20% Other tangible fixed assets 10% - 20% Tangible fixed assets are capitalised if the economic ownership is held by the company, and its Group companies, or is governed by a financial lease agreement. The qualification of a financial lease agreement is based on the contract duration, cumulative amounts of lease payments and other contract specific conditions that indicate economic ownership. The commitment arising from the financial lease agreement is accounted for as a liability. The interest included in the future lease instalments is charged to the financial result over the term of the financial lease agreement. Periodical major maintenance is capitalised according to the components approach, with which the aggregate expenditures are allocated to the component parts. ### Participating interests and prepaid expenses Participating interests in which significant influence can be exercised are valued based on the equity method by applying the Q-Park Holding B.V. valuation and accounting policies. It is presumed that significant influence can be exercised when Q-Park Holding B.V. has 20% or more of the voting rights in the General Meeting of Shareholders. If the valuation according to the equity method of a participating interest comes out negative, this is valued at zero. A provision is recognised if and insofar as, in this situation, Q-Park Holding B.V. is fully or partially liable for the debts of the participating interest or has the firm intention to guarantee its participating interest's liabilities. The first valuation of acquired participating interests is based on the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the moment of acquisition. Participating interests in which no significant influence can be exercised are classified as financial instrument and stated at fair value. The prepaid expenses are valued at amortised cost. ### Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets with respect to tax-deductible losses and temporary valuation differences are recognised and are valued at the tax rates expected to apply in the future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if and ----- to the extent that sufficient fiscal benefit is expected as compensation or if sufficient deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary taxable differences are available. Deferred tax assets and liabilities will be offset against each other if these fall within a tax group for corporate tax and as far as the periods in which settlement is expected coincide. ### Receivables On initial recognition, receivables are valued at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The fair value and amortised cost equal the face value. Provisions deemed necessary for possible bad debt losses are deducted. These provisions are determined by individual assessment of the receivables. ### Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand and are valued at face value. If cash is not freely disposable, then this has been taken into account on valuation. ### Provisions Provisions are made if Q-Park Holding B.V. has a present obligation (contractual or actual) resulting from a past event. A provision is only recognised insofar as a reliable estimate of the liability can be made and it is probable that such a liability will have to be paid. However, the exact size and timing of the outgoing cash flow is uncertain. The expenses associated with a provision are recognised in the income statement. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the provisions will be discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds as at balance sheet date. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs reflect the least net costs of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. As the time value of money is material to the provision it is discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds. Deferred tax liabilities The deferred tax liabilities with respect to temporary differences between the tax base and commercial valuation of assets and liabilities are stated at nominal value and based on the tax rates against which these differences are expected to be settled in the future. Pensions In relation to pension benefits the Group makes use of the provision to (integrally) apply the IFRS standards on pension benefits. Within the Group there are a variety of pension schemes in accordance with the conditions and practices prevailing in the countries in which the Group operates. The schemes qualify as defined contribution plans under which contributions are paid into pension funds or to insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except for paying these contributions, the Group has no other obligations to pay further contributions by virtue of these plans. Premium liabilities are charged to the result at the moment the liability arises and no provisions are made for future increases of pension premiums. ----- ### Non-current liabilities Lease obligations Long-term liabilities arising from financial lease contracts are stated in the balance sheet at the discounted value, only insofar as they are fixed, irreversible liabilities. This discounted value is determined based on the incremental borrowing rate for these liabilities. The interest expenses related to these liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Loans On initial recognition, loans are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The costs of concluding loans, prepaid interest charges and financing charges are deducted from the loan and are charged to the result according to the effective interest method over the duration of the loans. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a debt instrument and allocating the interest income over the relevant period. Repayments within a year after balance sheet date are presented as a separate item as part of the current liabilities. ### Financial instruments Q-Park Holding B.V. uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) such as interest rate swaps (IRS) and interest rate caps (IRC) to hedge against the risk of changing interest rates. Financial derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are valued at their fair value at every subsequent balance sheet date. Hedges relate to the risk of possible variability of cash flows attributable to a recognised asset, or obligation, or an expected transaction, or the currency risk of an off-balance obligation for which a contract has been undertaken. Movements in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of the line item 'financial result'. ### Current liabilities On initial recognition, current liabilities are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost (which is usually in line with the nominal amount). ### Determining the result Costs are determined in accordance with the accounting policies defined and are allocated to the appropriate reporting period. Profits are reported in the period in which the services are provided. Losses are recognised in the period in which they are known. ### Revenue recognition Net revenue represents amounts invoiced for services provided during the financial period, net of discounts and value added taxes. Revenue is recognised based on the service delivered to the customer till balance sheet date. The costs of providing these services are allocated to the same period. The revenue recognised consists of: ### I Parking revenues: revenue from short-stay parking and season tickets at parking facilities operated by the Group. ### I Control fees: income arising from enforcement of paid parking (parking fines) on or in parking facilities owned by the Group and/or by third parties. ### I Management fees: concerns the fixed and variable allowance for operating parking facilities for third parties. I Rental income: rental income from parking facilities owned by the Group but operated by third parties, as well as income from renting specific areas in parking facilities to third parties. ----- ### I EV charging revenues: revenue from electric vehicle charging points that are owned by the Group. I Other revenues: concerns all other income not included in the categories above. Gains resulting from the disposal of tangible fixed assets or participations are accounted for when all major entitlements to economic benefits as well as all major risks have transferred to the buyer. ### Financial result The financial result consists of both the financial expenses as well as the financial income. Interest costs on loans and interest rate derivatives, as well as amortised refinancing costs are accounted for under financial expenses. Interest income on outstanding cash and cash equivalents is accounted for under financial income. ### Taxes Corporate income tax is calculated at the applicable rate on the result for the financial year, taking into account permanent differences between profit calculated according to the financial statements and profit calculated for taxation purposes. The current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period including changes regarding taxes to be paid in respect of previous years. ### Condensed cash flow statement The condensed cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The funds in the condensed cash flow statement consist of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can be considered to be highly liquid investments. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at an estimated average rate. Exchange rate differences concerning finances are shown separately in the condensed cash flow statement. Corporate income taxes, interest received and dividends received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. Interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. The cost of Group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of Group companies acquired is presented separately in the reconciliation of the net cash flow and in the balance sheet movement of the cash position. Issuance of share capital is presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Transactions that do not result in exchange of cash and cash equivalents, such as financial lease, are not presented in the cash flow statement. Lease instalment payments for financial lease contracts are presented as debt redemption for the redemption component and as interest paid for the interest component. ----- # 3 Significant developments ### Equity movement schedule The following table shows the equity movements within the reporting period: (x EUR million) March 2024 Balance as per January 1 462.7 Consolidated net result for the reporting period -12.5 Direct equity movements: Foreign exchange differences on foreign investments -0.8 Total direct equity movements -0.8 Balance as per March 31 449.4 ### Refinancing of 2025 notes At the end of March 2024, the total amount of the interest-bearing borrowings recognised under the current and long-term liabilities was EUR 1,650.0 million (year-end 2023: EUR 1,644.1 million) from which the capitalised transaction costs of EUR 14.8 million have been deducted (year-end 2023: EUR 16.7 million).

This refinancing was executed through a tender offer after which EUR 293.8 million of notes were repaid against a purchase price of 98.5% of the face value. The remainder of the refinanced notes (EUR 131.2 million) is redeemed through satisfaction and discharge. The Group irrevocably deposited with the trustee an amount sufficient to fund the payment of the principal amount of these notes and the accrued and unpaid interest up to maturity date in January 2025. After the deposit of these funds with the trustee, the Group's obligations related to the 2025 notes are satisfied and discharged and are accounted for as a debt extinguishment. ### Net revenue The specification of net revenue is shown in the following table.

The company is active in multiple cities and marks further extension of our footprint in the UK. The preliminary acquisition price of the shares amounted to EUR 33.5 million. Due to the recent completion of the acquisition and the ongoing integration process, it is not practically feasible at this time to provide more detailed information. ### Collapsed ramps St. Antonius Hospital parking On May 26, 2024, the ramps of the Q-Park St. Antonius Hospital parking garage collapsed near the namesake hospital in Nieuwegein. After intensive investigation using search dogs and drones, the Utrecht Safety Region determined overnight that there were no injuries or casualties. The Dutch Safety Board (OVV) has started an exploratory investigation into the cause of the incident on May 27, 2024, which will inform their decision on further steps. Q-Park, the parking operator, and Primevest, the owner of the parking garage, are relieved that visitors and employees remained unharmed. The cause is currently unknown. Q-Park is fully cooperating with the investigation. The safety of our visitors and the employees of the hospital and Q-Park is paramount. Therefore, the garage will remain completely closed until further notice, and access is prohibited. At this point, it is too early to estimate the financial impact of this incident. ----- # Audited Consolidated Annual Accounts and Company Annual Accounts of Q-Park Holding B.V. as of and for the Year ended December 31, 2023 ----- # Directors’ Report The Directors’ Report is not included in these annual accounts.

The Company is filed with the Trade Register at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68805934. The activities of Q-Park Holding B.V. and its Group companies primarily consist of providing off-street and on-street parking services at strategic locations. The consolidated annual accounts have been drawn up by the Management Board for the year 2023 and were approved on 18 April 2024. All amounts are in EUR millions unless stated otherwise. Q-Park Holding B.V.'s consolidated annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. By virtue of Title 9 of Book 2, Section 402, Dutch Civil Code the Company annual accounts contain an abridged profit and loss account. ### Group structure Q-Park Holding B.V. is the head of the Group of legal entities included in the consolidation. The Company's direct shareholder is Byzantium Acquisition MidCo 1 B.V. registered at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68802641. The ultimate shareholders of the Company are a consortium consisting of investment funds advised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (London, United Kingdom), Eureizen (Paris, France), PensionDanmark Pensionsforsikringsaktieselskab (Copenhagen, Denmark), Euro-Parking Investments S.à r.l. (Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and Babylon Investments B.V. (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). An overview of the Group companies and the Company’s other participating interests is set out in the note on Group companies and participating interests. ### Going concern The ongoing geopolitical unrest and the inflationary environment in Europe continued to lead to elevated economic uncertainty. Although we are not directly impacted by the war and conflict, we have experienced the effects of increasing energy prices, labour costs and CPI related indexation of our lease portfolio. The impact of these price and cost increases on the year-to-date results was offset by our pricing initiatives and increased visitor volumes. As such we did not experience a material impact of these developments on our performance. The main uncertainty is linked to consumer behaviour and impact on the parking business when general price increases result in a decrease in GDP growth and consumer spending. As of the preparation date of the consolidated financial statements, it is difficult to assess this potential risk. However, we have not yet seen a negative impact of this uncertainty on consumer parking behaviour. The year-to-date results and current economic developments in combination with the liquidity position available give us the comfort that the Group has sufficient means to deal with these remaining uncertainties. The consolidated financial statements were therefore prepared based on going concern assumptions. We do, however, continue to monitor our financial structure. In January 2024 the notes due in 2025 of EUR 425.0 have been refinanced and ----- replaced with a new EUR 430.0 notes tranche due in 2029, further securing our liquidity position. Discussions on the refinancing of the notes tranche due in 2026 will be initiated in the first half of 2024. # 2 Significant accounting policies ### General The consolidated annual accounts and Company annual accounts are presented in euros. The euro is the presentation currency as well as the functional currency of Q-Park Holding B.V. Each entity within the Group recognises transactions and balance sheet items in its own functional currency. ### Consolidation Financial information relating to Group companies and other legal entities controlled by Q-Park Holding B.V. or where central management is conducted has been consolidated in the financial statements of Q-Park Holding B.V. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles of Q-Park Holding B.V. An overview of the Group companies and the Company’s other participating interests is set out in the note on Group companies and participating interests. Financial information relating to the Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation is fully included in the consolidated financial statements, eliminating the intercompany relationships and transactions. The results of newly acquired Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation are consolidated as from the acquisition date. On that date, the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value. If the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, this is goodwill which is capitalised and amortised over the expected useful life. ### Foreign currencies Receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are converted at the prevailing exchange rates as per balance sheet date. Foreign exchange rate differences arising are incorporated in the consolidated income statement. The income statements from Group companies registered abroad are converted at the average exchange rate for the period of the consolidated income statement. The net result from these Group companies is converted at the exchange rate prevailing at balance sheet date. The difference between these two conversions is accounted for in the shareholders' equity (statutory exchange rate differences reserve). Assets and liabilities of a Group company incorporated abroad are converted at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date for the purposes of consolidation. Foreign exchange rate differences that arise are directly deducted from or added, after deduction of deferred tax effects, to the Group equity and recognised in the statutory exchange rate differences reserve. Likewise, this also applies to the translation differences on loans that form part of the net investment in the foreign operations. ----- Overview of the exchange rates used for drawing up the annual accounts: 2023 2022 Average End Average End British pound (GBP) 1.1497 1.1507 1.1732 1.1275 Danish crown (DKK) 0.1342 0.1342 0.1344 0.1345 ### Estimates in the annual accounts When applying the Group’s accounting policies, it is necessary to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The most important of these estimates are explained as follows. At balance sheet date Q-Park Holding B.V. judges if there are any indicators present that goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and/or tangible fixed assets are impaired. If and when indicators such as a declining performance or other negative market developments are identified, an impairment calculation is performed based on an estimation of future cash flows. If applicable an impairment result is recognised. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The provision for onerous contracts is determined based on an estimate of future cash flows and losses. These cash flow projections and the related onerous contract provision are reassessed on an annual basis based on the actual cash flow developments of the most recent reporting period and other relevant developments impacting the estimate. There is some uncertainty regarding the explanation of complex tax regulations and the tax effects of the acquisition and financing structure of Q-Park. Considering the wide range of international business relationships and the long-running and complex nature of existing contractual agreements, differences may arise between the assumptions made and the actual results, or future changes in such assumptions may influence the actual results. Deferred tax assets related to unused tax losses are recognised insofar as it is probable that profit for tax purposes will be available to which these losses can be offset. To determine the value of these deferred tax assets arising from tax losses, a management assessment is required regarding the probable timing and estimated level of future taxable profits, combined with future fiscal planning strategies. For further details on the tax positions, reference is made to note 17 'Taxes'. ----- ### Business combination The purchase accounting method is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises: ### I fair values of the assets transferred; I liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business; I equity interests issued by the Group; I net present value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share in the fair value of the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities. Acquisition-related costs are capitalised as part of the purchase price. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, adjusted for any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value against the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds at the date of exchange. A contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. ### Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets are presented at cost including all directly attributable costs less accumulated amortisation and, if applicable, less impairments in value. Amortisation is charged as a fixed percentage of cost, as specified in more detail in the notes to the balance sheet. The expected useful life and the amortisation method are reassessed at the end of each financial year. Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of between 5 to 20 years. This period is derived from the long-term business profile of the underlying acquisitions and cash flows from the operated assets (owned and leased parking facilities). Concessions The concessions relate to all investments in French parking facilities involving a (finite) concession for the use of the ground and facility. The concessions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the underlying concession contracts with an assumed residual value of nil. Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets consist of the corporate trade name and other intangible fixed assets (mainly software). The corporate trade name is capitalised as part of business combinations at fair value on acquisition date. ----- The other intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life with an assumed residual value of nil. The following table shows an indication of the useful life per asset category. Categories Percentage Trade name 5% Software and other 20% ### Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at the cost price less accumulated depreciation and, if applicable, less impairments. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is based on linear depreciation over the expected period in use and taking the expected residual value into account. Depreciation commences on the date an asset comes into use. The following table shows an indication of the assessed useful economic life and depreciation percentages applied to the different fixed asset categories. Categories Percentage Buildings 2% - 3% Leasehold improvements 5% - 10% Parking equipment and installations 10% - 20% Other tangible fixed assets 10% - 20% Tangible fixed assets are capitalised if the economic ownership is held by the Company, and its Group companies, or is governed by a financial lease agreement. The qualification of a financial lease agreement is based on the contract duration, cumulative amounts of lease payments and other contract-specific conditions that indicate economic ownership. The commitment arising from the financial lease agreement is accounted for as a liability. The interest included in the future lease instalments is charged to the financial result over the term of the financial lease agreement. Periodic major maintenance is capitalised according to the components approach with which the aggregate expenditures are allocated to the component parts. ### Participating interests and prepaid expenses Participating interests in which significant influence can be exercised are valued based on the equity method by applying the Q-Park Holding B.V. valuation and accounting policies. It is presumed that significant influence can be exercised when Q-Park Holding B.V. has 20% or more of the voting rights in the General Meeting of Shareholders. If the valuation according to the equity method of a participating interest comes out negative, this is valued at zero. A provision is recognised if and insofar as, in this situation, Q-Park Holding B.V. is fully or partially liable for the debts of the participating interest or has the firm intention to guarantee its participating interest's liabilities. The first valuation of acquired participating interests is based on the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the moment of acquisition. ----- Participating interests in which no significant influence can be exercised are classified as financial instruments and stated at fair value. The prepaid expenses are valued at amortised cost. ### Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets with respect to tax-deductible losses and temporary valuation differences are recognised and are valued at the tax rates expected to apply in the future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if and to the extent that sufficient fiscal benefit is expected as compensation or if sufficient deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary taxable differences are available. Deferred tax assets and liabilities will be offset against each other if these fall within a tax group for corporate tax and as far as the periods in which settlement is expected coincide. ### Receivables On initial recognition, receivables are valued at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The fair value and amortised cost equal the face value. Provisions deemed necessary for possible bad debt losses are deducted. These provisions are determined by individual assessment of the receivables. ### Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand, and are valued at face value. If cash is not freely disposable, this has been taken into account on valuation. ### Provisions Provisions are made if Q-Park Holding B.V. has a present obligation (contractual or actual) resulting from a past event. A provision is only recognised insofar as a reliable estimate of the liability can be made and it is probable that such a liability will have to be paid. However, the exact size and timing of the outgoing cash flow is uncertain. The expenses associated with a provision are recognised in the income statement. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the provisions will be discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds as at balance sheet date. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs reflect the least net costs of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it, and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. As the time value of money is material to the provision it is discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds. Deferred tax liabilities The deferred tax liabilities with respect to temporary differences between the tax base and commercial valuation of assets and liabilities are stated at nominal value and based on the tax rates against which these differences are expected to be settled in the future. ----- Pensions In relation to pension benefits the Group makes use of the provision to (integrally) apply the IFRS standards on pension benefits. Within the Group there are a variety of pension schemes in accordance with the conditions and practices prevailing in the countries in which the Group operates. The schemes qualify as defined contribution plans under which contributions are paid into pension funds or to insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except for paying these contributions, the Group has no other obligations to pay further contributions by virtue of these plans. Premium liabilities are charged to the result at the moment the liability arises and no provisions are made for future increases of pension premiums. ### Non-current liabilities Lease obligations Long-term liabilities arising from financial lease contracts are stated in the balance sheet at the discounted value, only insofar as they are fixed, irreversible liabilities. This discounted value is determined based on the incremental borrowing rate for these liabilities. The interest expenses related to these liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Loans On initial recognition, loans are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The costs of concluding loans, prepaid interest charges and financing charges are deducted from the loan and are charged to the result according to the effective interest method over the duration of the loans. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a debt instrument and allocating the interest income over the relevant period. Repayments within a year after balance sheet date are presented as a separate item as part of the current liabilities. ### Financial instruments Q-Park Holding B.V. uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) such as interest rate swaps (IRS) and interest rate caps (IRC) to hedge against the risk of changing interest rates. Financial derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are valued at their fair value at every subsequent balance sheet date. Hedges relate to the risk of possible variability of cash flows attributable to a recognised asset, or obligation, or an expected transaction, or the currency risk of an off-balance obligation for which a contract has been undertaken. Movements in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of the line item ‘financial result’. ### Current liabilities On initial recognition, current liabilities are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost (which is usually in line with the nominal amount). ### Determining the result Costs are determined in accordance with the accounting policies defined and are allocated to the appropriate reporting year. Profits are reported in the year in which the services are provided. Losses are recognised in the year in which they are known. ----- ### Revenue recognition Net revenue represents amounts invoiced for services supplied during the financial year, net of discounts and value added taxes. Revenue is recognised based on the service delivered to the customer till balance sheet date. The costs of providing these services are allocated to the same period. The revenue recognised consists of: ### I Parking revenues: revenue from short-stay parking and season tickets at parking facilities operated by the Group. ### I Control fees: income arising from enforcement of paid parking (parking fines) on or in parking facilities owned by the Group and/or by third parties. ### I Management fees: the fixed and variable allowance for operating parking facilities for third parties. I Rental income: rent from parking facilities owned by the Group but operated by third parties, as well as income from renting specific areas in parking facilities to third parties. ### I EV charging revenues: revenue from electric vehicle charging points that are owned by the Group. I Other revenues: all other income not included in the categories above. Gains resulting from the disposal of tangible fixed assets or participations are accounted for when all major entitlements to economic benefits as well as all major risks have transferred to the buyer. ### Financial result The financial result consists of both the financial expenses as well as the financial income. Interest costs on loans and interest rate derivatives, as well as amortised refinancing costs are accounted for under financial expenses. Interest income on outstanding cash and cash equivalents is accounted for under financial income. ### Taxes Corporate income tax is calculated at the applicable rate on the result for the financial year, taking into account permanent differences between profit calculated according to the financial statements and profit calculated for taxation purposes. The current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period including changes regarding taxes to be paid in respect of previous years. ### Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The funds in the cash flow statement consist of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can be considered to be highly liquid investments. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at an estimated average rate. Exchange rate differences concerning finances are shown separately in the cash flow statement. Corporate income taxes, interest received and dividends received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. Interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. The cost of Group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of Group companies ----- acquired is presented separately in the reconciliation of the net cash flow and in the balance sheet movement of the cash position. Issuance of share capital is presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Transactions that do not result in exchange of cash and cash equivalents, such as entering into a financial lease, are not presented in the cash flow statement. Lease instalment payments for financial lease contracts are presented as repayment for the repayment component and as interest paid for the interest component. ----- # 3 Acquisitions ### Acquisition of Tazbell Services Group DAC On 31 August 2023 the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Tazbell Services Group (Park Rite), via its subsidiary Q-Park Ireland Ltd. The acquisition price of the shares (including acquisition costs) amounted to EUR 38.7 million (in cash only). In Q-Park, the acquisition is accounted for based on the ‘purchase accounting’ method. The goodwill resulting from the transaction amounts to EUR 24.5 million. The goodwill depreciation term is set at 10 years and is derived from the estimated contract duration of the underlying parking contracts. The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition date was as follows: (x EUR million) NON-CURRENT ASSETS TOTAL EQUITY 14.2 Intangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets 14.1 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Provisions - deferred tax liability 1.9 Debt credit institutions 4.3 CURRENT ASSETS Receivables 1.3 CURRENT LIABILITIES Cash and cash equivalents 10.3 Liabilities 5.3 TOTAL ASSETS 25.7 TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 25.7 ### Acquisition of City Parkeringsservice A.S. On 4 October 2023 the Group acquired 100% of the shares in City Parkeringsservice A.S. The company is a medium-sized control fee business in the Danish parking market. The acquisition price of the shares (including acquisition costs) amounted to EUR 10.7 million (in cash only). In Q-Park, the acquisition is accounted for based on the ‘purchase accounting’ method. The goodwill resulting from the transaction amounts to EUR 10.5 million. The goodwill depreciation term is set at 10 years and is derived from the estimated contract duration of the underlying parking contracts. ----- The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition date was as follows: (x EUR million) NON-CURRENT ASSETS TOTAL EQUITY 0.2 Intangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets 0.3 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Provisions CURRENT ASSETS CURRENT LIABILITIES Receivables 0.6 Liabilities 0.7 Cash and cash equivalents -0.0 TOTAL ASSETS 0.9 TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 0.9 ----- # 4 Intangible fixed assets Movements in the goodwill and other intangible fixed assets are shown in the table.

Total goodwill is determined as the difference between the acquisition price and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. Based on the further recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in 2023 and the solid performance in all our countries in combination with the overall business growth, there are no indications that goodwill should be impaired. Goodwill at balance sheet date has a remaining useful life between 1 and 14 years. ### Concessions Concessions relate to the cost price of (fair value at acquisition date) and subsequent investments in the concession contracts in France. Investments in concession contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis according to the duration of the underlying concession contracts. The book value of the concessions includes all capital expenditure related to the underlying parking facilities. Of the total book value, EUR 27.6 million relates to concessions under construction. ----- ### Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets mainly include the Q-Park trade name and software and can be summarised as follows: (x EUR million) 2023 2022 Trade name 51.1 54.8 Software and other 33.6 31.1 Balance as per 31 December 84.7 85.9 ----- # 5 Tangible fixed assets Movements in tangible fixed assets are shown in the table.

During 2023 we have implemented new software for the calculation of the financial positions related to financial lease contracts. This new software has a more detailed and precise calculation of the cash flows related to these financial lease contracts than our previous system. The impact on the prior period closing balance of the financial lease assets ----- amounted to EUR 11.1 million. Note that on the financial lease liability there was a communicating adjustment of EUR 12.3 million. The net difference between the opening balance adjustment of the financial lease asset and liability is recognised in P&L as part of the depreciation charges on financial lease assets. This new software has a more detailed and precise calculation of the cash flows related to these financial lease contracts than our previous system. The impact on the prior period closing balance of the financial lease liability amounted to EUR 12.3 million. Note that on the financial lease assets there was a communicating adjustment of EUR 11.1 million. The net difference between the opening balance adjustment of the financial lease asset and liability is recognised in P&L as part of the depreciation charges on financial lease assets. Investments including assets from acquisitions in 2023 amounted to EUR 93.0 million consisting of investments in existing facilities as well as new portfolio additions. Furthermore, the total investments include the additions in parking facilities financed by means of financial lease constructions. The level of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic as well as other specific developments negatively impacting performance of individual parking facilities can be an indicator of a potential impairment of the related tangible fixed assets. We have therefore analysed our portfolio of individual parking facilities (cash generating units) and performed impairment tests on the parking facilities for which the 2023 performance is below expectations and for which recovery lagged behind the general trend. The value in use of these assets is based on a discounted cash flow model per asset. The cash flows used in the model are derived from current performance and growth expectations for future periods. The post-tax discount rate used for discounting the cash flows is determined per country and ranges from 6.0% to 7.3%. Though the discount rates used are based on generic company parameters, it varies per country as a result of country specific risk premiums and applicable corporate income tax rates. The impairment test performed resulted in an impairment of EUR -20.1 million (2022: EUR -40.1 million) of owned and financial leased properties. The impairment result primarily relates to facilities and locations that were already struggling before the coronavirus pandemic. Further deterioration of the areas in which these facilities are located meant they have not recovered in line with other facilities in our portfolio. As part of the corporate financing positions, the majority of corporate assets have been pledged either by mortgage or share pledges. The guarantee affects the majority of the Group with exemption of some owned assets located in Belgium, Denmark and France. ----- # 6 Participating interests and Long-term receivables Movements in participating interests and long-term receivables are shown in the table.

(x EUR million) 2023 2022 Personnel related payables 10.2 9.3 Lease costs 38.4 30.5 Interest and bank costs 24.2 20.4 Revenue invoiced in advance 59.8 56.6 Accruals and other liabilities 60.8 47.5 Balance as per 31 December 193.4 164.3 # 13 Contingencies and liabilities not included in the balance sheet The Group operates parking facilities under operational lease agreements. The total nominal fixed lease obligation relating to these operational lease agreements amounts to EUR 1,936.0 million (2022: EUR 1,951.5 million). Of this amount, EUR 186.4 million (2022: EUR 179.1 million) is due within one year, EUR 666.1 million (2022: EUR 646.1 million) is due between 1 to 5 years and EUR 1,083.5 million (2022: EUR 1,126.3 million) is due after five or more years.

At the end of 2023, Q-Park Holding B.V., including its Group companies, was involved in various legal proceedings and disputes. Based on an assessment of financial risk for the claims received, provisions have been made or the financial consequences have been accounted for in the annual accounts, as far as is deemed necessary. In relation to the legal proceedings and disputes that are not included in the balance sheet, the risk of a cash outflow is assessed as highly remote. # 14 Events after balance sheet date In January 2024 a refinancing of the EUR 425.0 million notes due in 2025 with a fixed interest rate of 1.5% was executed and replaced with a EUR 430.0 million notes issuance due in 2029 with a fixed interest rate of 5.125%. This refinancing was executed through a tender offer after which EUR 293.8 million of notes were repaid against a purchase price of 98.5%. The remainder of the refinanced notes (EUR 131.2 million) is redeemed through satisfaction and discharge. The Group irrevocably deposited with the trustee an amount sufficient to fund the payment of the principal amount of these notes and the accrued and unpaid interest up to maturity date in January 2025. After the deposit of these funds with the trustee, the Group's obligations related to the 2025 notes are satisfied and discharged and will be accounted for as a debt extinguishment. # 15 Net revenue The specification of net revenue is shown in the following table.

(x EUR million) 2023 2022 % EUR % EUR Taxes on direct result based on domestic tax rates 25.8% 5.7 25.8% 20.0 Adjustments: Adjustments for actual Group companies rate -0.3 -0.7 Non-taxable goodwill amortisation and impairment -10.3 -10.3 Non-deductible interest expenses -4.9 -4.3 Other permanent differences -4.6 -2.3 Other adjustments 26.0 -1.5 Total tax income/(expense) 52% 11.6 1% 0.9 The other permanent differences primarily relate to non-deductible other expenses consisting of non-deductible lease expenses for German trade tax purposes and shareholder management fees. In 2021 the other permanent differences also included the effect of non-valued fiscal losses in the recognition of deferred tax losses. The other adjustments in 2023 mainly concern the effect of movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a corporate tax rate change in the United Kingdom in combination with the positive impact of valuing available fiscal losses based on the strong recovery and improved performance in the financial year 2023. In 2023 the government of The Netherlands, where the parent company is incorporated, enacted the Pillar Two income taxes legislation effective from 1 January 2024. Under the legislation, the parent company will amongst others be required to pay top-up tax on profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%. At present we are implementing measures to comply with Pillar Two. Given the effective tax rates in the jurisdictions the Group operates, limited to no effects on the tax expense are expected. The deferred tax balances recognised in the balance sheet are detailed in the following table. (x EUR million) 2023 2022 Available tax losses carried forward 43.0 22.9 Other temporary valuation differences 69.3 57.8 Total deferred tax assets 112.3 80.7 Other temporary valuation differences 237.9 243.0 Total deferred tax liabilities 237.9 243.0 ----- The total deferred tax losses carried forward mostly relate to available tax-deductible losses, mainly in Germany, the United Kingdom and Belgium. The recoverability of the tax-deductible losses has been assessed in the light of current performance, the updated business plan and prevailing tax regulations. Based on this assessment the available fiscal losses are valued in full. At 31 December 2023 the estimated amount of carry forward interest available amounted to EUR 90.9 million (2022: EUR 74.1 million). No deferred tax asset is recognised for this interest carry forward as it is not likely that it can be utilized in the near future. The other deferred taxable differences included in the deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary valuation differences on financial derivatives, financial leasing and provisions for onerous lease contracts. The deferred tax liabilities mainly comprise of the temporary valuation differences between the fiscal and commercial valuation of parking facilities. The value is largely due to the fair value step-up of assets resulting from the purchase accounting of the Q-Park Group acquisition. Movements in the deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in the following table.

The Management Board of Q-Park Holding B.V. has four members. The compensation for two of the board members is paid as a service fee to the management company that employs the board members and amounts to EUR 0.1 million for the year 2023 (2022: EUR 0.1 million). The other two are unsalaried board members as their services are part of the total management fee as disclosed in note 19 'Related parties'. # 19 Related parties A related party is a person or an entity that is related to the Group. These include both people and entities that have, or are subject to, the influence or control of the Group. During 2023, the Group paid management fees to its shareholders of EUR 5.3 million (2022: EUR 5.3 million). ----- # 20 Risk management regarding financial instruments ### Policy concerning financial risk management The policy regarding managing financial risks is determined by the Management Board and key management. The key financial risks to which Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed are market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. Market risk can be further split into interest exposure and currency risk; these risks are closely monitored internally. Instruments for managing these risks include financial derivatives. The Company does not take speculative positions with financial instruments. ### Interest exposure Interest rate fluctuations influence the direct result of Q-Park Holding B.V. The Group interest policy is designed to limit risks and can be explained as follows: ### I interest-bearing debts have a fixed interest component and a variable interest component, where the interest from the variable interest component is hedged by means of interest rate swaps (IRS) and caps; ### I overall, at least 70% of the term loan should be protected from interest rate fluctuations. At the end of 2023, loan positions were partly hedged by means of an interest rate swaps (IRS) for EUR 110.0 million (2022: EUR 110.0 million). As a result of the hedging positions in combination with the fixed rated part of the loans, 80% of the total loans (EUR 1,644.1 million) is insensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which is well above the Group's policy. The following table shows the hedging of the loan positions further specified by time to maturity of the interest rate derivatives. 2023 2022 Hedged value (x EUR million) Number of contracts Hedged value (x EUR million) Time to maturity Number of contracts Period < 5 years 1 110.0 1 110.0 5 years < period < 10 years - - - 10 years < period < 15 years - - - Period > 15 year - - - Total 1 110.0 1 110.0 ### Currency risk Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to its activities in the United Kingdom and Denmark. This is exposure is primarily limited to a translation effect of the net investments in these countries as the operational activities take place locally and there are no cross-border activities in foreign currencies. Therefore, related revenue, costs and capital expenditure are all in the same currency. The exposure on the translation effect of the net investment is not hedged. ----- ### Liquidity risk Q-Park Holding B.V. endeavours to limit the liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of sufficient credit facilities to support the operating activities and meet financial obligations. Given the solid cash flows and balance sheet positions, Q-Park Holding B.V. has sufficient access to these facilities. The following tables indicate the time to maturity of the contractual liabilities at the close of 2023. 2023 (x EUR million) < 1 year 1 to 5 years - 5 years Total Liabilities arising from loans 4.0 1,591.3 65.6 1,660.8 Lease obligations 74.8 297.5 1,544.2 1,916.5 Financial derivatives - 8.5 - 8.5 Other long-term liabilities - - 15.8 15.8 Provisions 3.1 - 41.2 44.3 Trade payables 56.1 - - 56.1 Other liabilities, accruals and deferred income 248.0 - - 248.0 Total 386.0 1,897.3 1,666.8 3,950.0 With the exception of the financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value, all items in the table are stated at face value, taking the moment of settlement into account. Liabilities arising from loans – with the exception of the local bilateral loans – will be refinanced. All other liabilities stated in the table are financed from working capital and operating cash flows. At balance sheet date, the financial lease obligations have an average time to maturity of more than ten years. ### Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its obligations arising from a financial instrument or contract with a client, causing financial damage. Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed to credit risk in connection with its operating activities (trade receivables in particular) and in connection with its financing activities, including deposits at banks and financial institutions, currency transactions, and other financial instruments. At the reporting date, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the book value of the receivables and cash and cash equivalents as explained in the respective notes. Q-Park Holding B.V. considers the credit risk to be limited. The concentration of risks concerning trade receivables is low, as the customers are widely dispersed. Assets held at the bank concern only assets at reputable banks. ### Fair value change of interest derivatives The fair value of the financial instruments is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. Relevant variables applicable to the valuation of these interest rate derivatives are the present value of interest payments and the expected interest rate curves. ----- The total negative market value of the interest derivatives comprise of the negative market value of interest rate swaps and amount to EUR 8.5 million (2022: EUR 7.0 million). The following table shows an overview of the book value and movements of the financial derivatives, subdivided per type. (x EUR million) 2023 2022 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Book value as per 1 January - -7.0 - -25.2 Movements in fair value - -1.5 - 18.2 Book value as per 31 December - -8.5 - -7.0 ### Capital management The primary objective of Group capital management is to maintain good creditworthiness and to ensure that the operating activities are optimally supported, so that these operating activities can be conducted effectively, efficiently and profitably and so that shareholder value is created. Q-Park Holding B.V. manages its capital structure and adjusts this to changes in economic circumstances. To maintain or modify the capital structure, Q-Park Holding B.V. may adjust dividend payments to shareholders, repay capital or issue new shares. ----- ## C O M P A N Y B A L A N C E S H E E T A S P E R 3 1 D E C E M B E R 31 December (x EUR million, before result appropriation) Notes Financial fixed assets 2023 31 December 2022 Participating interests 23 410.1 442.0 Intercompany receivables 24 105.7 105.7 515.8 547.7 Current assets Intercompany receivables 24 16.6 10.1 Other receivables, prepayments and accrued income - 16.6 10.1 Cash - TOTAL ASSETS 532.4 557.8 ----- 31 December 2022 (x EUR million, before result appropriation) Notes Shareholders' equity 31 December 2023 Paid-up and called-up capital 25 - Share premium reserve 25 913.7 913.7 Translation reserve 25 -21.9 -21.7 Other reserve 25 -399.5 -341.8 Result financial year 25 -29.0 -57.7 463.3 492.5 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Shareholder loan 26 52.7 52.7 52.7 52.7 Current liabilities Liabilities to shareholder 26 14.2 10.5 Intercompany liabilities 2.2 2.1 16.4 12.6 TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 532.4 557.8 ----- ## C O M P A N Y P R O F I T A N D L O S S A C C O U N T (x EUR million) Notes 2023 2022 Company result 2.7 2.6 Share in result of participating interests 23 -31.7 -60.3 Result after taxes -29.0 -57.7 ----- ## N O T E S T O T H E C O M P A N Y A N N U A L A C C O U N T S # 21 General information Q-Park Holding B.V.

The accounting policies used for the Company annual accounts are identical to those for the consolidated annual accounts. For the general principles for the preparation of the financial statements, the principles for valuation of assets and liabilities and determination of the result, as well as for the notes to the specific assets and liabilities and the results, reference is made to the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if not presented otherwise hereinafter. ### Participating interests Participating interests in Group companies and other entities where the Company may exercise control or where it has the central management are stated initially and on balance sheet date at net asset value. The value of these participating interests is corrected for the Company's share in the results of the participating interest, based on the accounting policies as these are applied in the consolidated annual accounts and for the share in other movements in the shareholders' equity of the participating interest attributable to the Company after the acquisition date. The net asset value is determined by stating the assets, provisions, liabilities and result using the accounting policies applied in the consolidated annual accounts. # 23 Participating interests Movements in the participating interests are shown in the following table.

The interest rate for the loan is set at 7%. There are no repayment obligations during the term of the loan only on the final repayment date. The intercompany receivables recognised under current assets mainly concern current account positions with Group companies for which no further agreements have been made about the term to maturity or repayment. # 25 Shareholders' equity Movements in the shareholders' equity are shown in the following table.

At the end of 2023 the difference in shareholder's equity amounted to EUR 0.6 million (2022: EUR 19.0 million). The statutory translation reserve (exchange rate differences reserve) is a legally required reserve and therefore not freely distributable. ### Share capital The issued share capital consists of 100 shares with a nominal value of EUR 1 per share.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Q-Park Holding B.V. as at 31 December 2023, and of its result for 2023 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The financial statements comprise: 1. The balance sheet as at 31 December 2023. 2. The profit and loss account for 2023. 3. The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information. ### Basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of Q-Park Holding B.V. in accordance with the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ### Information in support of our opinion We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters. ### Audit approach fraud risks We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud. This also includes monitoring the system of internal control and how the Management Board exercises oversight, as well as outcomes. We refer to section ‘Risk management’ of the Director’s report for management’s fraud risk assessment. ----- We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as among others the integrity training, zero-tolerance policy, whistle blower policy and incident registration. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to, among others, financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due fraud is present. We identified the following fraud risks and performed the following specific procedures: ### I We identified the presumed fraud risk related to management override of controls and the presumed fraud risk related to revenue recognition. ### I We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. ### I We considered available information and made enquiries of the Management Board and Country Management. ### I We tested the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements. ### I We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the entity, particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting. ### I We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the financial statements indicate a possible bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Management insights, estimates and assumptions that might have a major impact on the financial statements are disclosed in note 2 of the financial statements. ### I We have evaluated the impairment (indicator) testing of intangible and tangible fixed assets performed by management. Intangible and tangible fixed assets as disclosed in note 4 and 5 of the financial statements, are significant areas to our audit as the determination whether these assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amounts is subject to management judgment and estimation. We have, amongst others, evaluated qualitative factors for specific facilities and actual performance versus management’s expectations on parking facility and country level (retrospective review). Further, we evaluated the expected future cash flows and, where needed, we evaluated the weighted average cost of capital and long-term growth rate in close cooperation with our internal specialists. Our procedures performed did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements. ### Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations We assessed the laws and regulations relevant to the entity through discussion with Q-Park Holding B.V., and reading minutes. and reports of internal audit. As a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects from non-compliance could considerably vary, we considered the following laws and regulations: (corporate) tax law and the requirements under Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with a direct effect on the financial statements as an integrated part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the financial statements. ----- Apart from these, the entity is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance, through imposing fines or litigation. Given the nature of the entity's business and the complexity of these other laws and regulations, there is a risk of non-compliance with the requirements of such laws and regulations. Our procedures are more limited with respect to these laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to the entity's ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified audit procedures to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of management, and others within the entity as to whether the entity is in compliance with such laws and regulations and (ii) inspecting correspondence to help identify noncompliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Naturally, we remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us. ### Audit approach going concern Our responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of the Management Board, related to going concern under the prevailing standards are outlined in the “Description of responsibilities regarding the financnial statements” section below. In fulfilling our responsibilities, we performed procedures including evaluating management’s assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and considering the impact of financial, operational, and other conditions. Management’s conclusion on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is outlined in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The main uncertainty identified by management is linked to consumer behaviour and impact on the parking business when general price increases result in a decrease in GDP growth and consumer spending. The result of 2023 and current economic developments in combination with the available liquidity position, gives management the comfort that the Company has sufficient means to deal with these remaining uncertainties. We have evaluated the cash balance, cash forecasts and available liquidity position (including the current financing situation) of the Company. Further, we evaluated the forecasts (including the leverage ratio) of the Company through backtesting, comparing budget to actuals for the first months of 2024 and performing sensitivity analyses. In addition, as noted from page F-24 of the Going concern paragraph, the Company has refinanced and replaced the notes due in 2025 of EUR 425.0 with a new EUR 430.0 tranche due in 2029. This further secures the Company’s liquidity position. Additionally, management will start discussion for the refinancing of the notes due in 2026 in the first half of 2024. ----- Based on the aforementioned procedures, we did not identify any reportable findings related to the entity’s ability to continue as going concern. ### Report on the other information included in the annual report The annual accounts contain other information, in addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The other information consists of: ### I The Director’s Report. I Other Information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: ### I Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements. I Contains all the information regarding the management report and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Director’s Report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. ### Description of responsibilities regarding the annual accounts Responsibilities of management for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.Click or tap here to enter text. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. ----- ### Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others: ### I Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ### I Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. ### I Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ### I Concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. ### I Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures. ### I Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. ----- We communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit.

The Company is filed with the Trade Register at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68805934. The activities of Q-Park Holding B.V. and its Group companies primarily consist of providing off-street and on-street parking services at strategic locations. The consolidated annual accounts have been drawn up by the Management Board for the year 2022 and were approved on 13 April 2023. All amounts are in EUR millions unless stated otherwise. Q-Park Holding B.V.'s consolidated annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. By virtue of Title 9 of Book 2, Section 402, Dutch Civil Code the Company annual accounts contain an abridged profit and loss account. ### Group structure Q-Park Holding B.V. is the head of the Group of legal entities included in the consolidation. The Company's direct shareholder is Byzantium Acquisition MidCo 1 B.V. registered at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68802641. The ultimate shareholders of the Company are a consortium consisting of investment funds advised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (London, United Kingdom), Eureizen (Paris, France), PensionDanmark Pensionsforsikringsaktieselskab (Copenhagen, Denmark), Euro-Parking Investments S.a.r.l. (Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and Babylon Investments B.V. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). An overview of the Group companies and the Company’s other participating interests is set out in the note on Group companies and participating interests. ### Going concern The coronavirus pandemic and the related government restrictions on mobility continued to impact our business in early 2022. However with the easing of restrictions from mid-January 2022 onwards, our short-term parking revenues showed an immediate and strong rebound. From April onwards, reached the stable, pre-pandemic levels of 2019 with a strong December finish. On the back of increased resistance among the population following vaccination and/or previous infections the pandemic seems under control. Recent virus outbreaks did not result in overflowing hospital occupancy rates or renewed mobility restrictions, nor are there any signs this will occur in the coming months. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine and high inflation in Europe have provided for additional uncertainty. Although we are not directly impacted by the war, we are experiencing the effects of increasing energy prices, labour costs and CPI related indexation of our lease portfolio. The impact of these price and cost increases on the full year results was offset by active price and cost management. As such we did not experience a material impact of these developments on our 2022 performance. Energy costs are not the most significant amount in our total cost base and the price increase will be felt but not impact on our going concern assessment. The main uncertainty is linked to consumer behaviour and impact on the parking business when the general price increases result in a decrease ----- in GDP growth and consumer spending. As of the preparation date of the annual accounts, it is difficult to assess the risk of this impact. However, we have not yet experienced an active decrease in average mobility. The results of 2022 and current economic developments in combination with the liquidity position available, at the time of approving these annual accounts, give us the comfort that the Group has sufficient means to deal with these remaining uncertainties. The 2022 annual accounts were therefore prepared based on going concern assumptions. We do, however, continue to monitor our financial structure and have initiated discussions for refinancing the first bond tranche that is due in February 2025. # 2 Significant accounting policies ### General The consolidated annual accounts and Company annual accounts are presented in euros. The euro is the presentation currency as well as the functional currency of Q-Park Holding B.V. Each entity within the Group recognises transactions and balance sheet items in its own functional currency. ### Consolidation Financial information relating to Group companies and other legal entities controlled by Q-Park Holding B.V. or where central management is conducted has been consolidated in the financial statements of Q-Park Holding B.V. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles of Q-Park Holding B.V. An overview of the Group companies and the Company’s other participating interests is set out in the note on Group companies and participating interests. Financial information relating to the Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation is fully included in the consolidated financial statements, eliminating the intercompany relationships and transactions. The results of newly acquired Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation are consolidated as from the acquisition date. On that date, the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value. If the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, this is goodwill which is capitalised and amortised over the expected useful life. ### Foreign currencies Receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are converted at the prevailing exchange rates as per balance sheet date. Foreign exchange rate differences arising are incorporated in the consolidated income statement. The income statements from Group companies registered abroad are converted at the average exchange rate for the period of the consolidated income statement. The net result from these Group companies is converted at the exchange rate prevailing at balance sheet date. The difference between these two conversions is accounted for in the shareholders' equity (statutory exchange rate differences reserve). Assets and liabilities of a Group company incorporated abroad are converted at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date for the purposes of consolidation. Foreign exchange rate differences that arise ----- are directly deducted from or added, after deduction of deferred tax effects, to the Group equity and recognised in the statutory exchange rate differences reserve. Likewise, this also applies to the translation differences on loans that form part of the net investment in the foreign operations. Overview of the exchange rates used for drawing up the annual accounts: 2022 2021 Average End Average End British pound (GBP) 1.1732 1.1275 1.1632 1.1901 Danish crown (DKK) 0.1344 0.1345 0.1345 0.1345 ### Estimates in the annual accounts When applying the Group’s accounting policies, it is necessary to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The most important of these estimates are explained as follows. At balance sheet date Q-Park Holding B.V. determines whether there are any indicators that goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and/or tangible fixed assets are impaired. If and when indicators are identified, an impairment calculation is performed and if applicable an impairment result is recognised. The provision for onerous contracts is determined based on a projection of cash flows and estimated losses. These cash flow projections and the related onerous contract provision are reassessed on an annual basis based on the actual cash flow developments of the most recent reporting period and other developments impacting the estimation. There is some uncertainty regarding the explanation of complex tax regulations and the tax effects of the acquisition and financing structure of Q-Park. Considering the wide range of international business relationships and the long-running and complex nature of existing contractual agreements, differences may arise between the assumptions made and the actual results, or future changes in such assumptions may influence the actual results. Deferred tax assets related to unused tax losses are recognised insofar as it is probable that profit for tax purposes will be available to which this can be offset. To determine the value of the deferred tax assets arising from tax losses not offset, a management assessment is required regarding the probable timing and level of the future taxable profits, combined with future fiscal planning strategies. For further details on the tax positions, reference is made to note 17 'Taxes'. ----- ### Business combination The purchase accounting method is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises: ### I fair values of the assets transferred; I liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business; I equity interests issued by the Group; I net present value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share in the fair value of the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities. Acquisition-related costs are capitalised as part of the purchase price. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, adjusted for any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value against the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds at the date of exchange. A contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. ### Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets are presented at cost including all directly attributable costs less accumulated amortisation and, if applicable, less impairments in value. Amortisation is charged as a fixed percentage of cost, as specified in more detail in the notes to the balance sheet. The expected useful life and the amortisation method are reassessed at the end of each financial year. Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of between 5 to 20 years. This period is derived from the long-term business profile of the underlying acquisitions and cash flows from the operated assets (owned and leased parking facilities). Concessions The concessions relate to all investments in French parking facilities involving a (finite) concession for the use of the ground and facility. The concessions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the underlying concession contracts with an assumed residual value of nil. Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets consist of the corporate trade name and other intangible fixed assets (mainly software). The corporate trade name is capitalised as part of business combinations at fair value on acquisition date. ----- The other intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life with an assumed residual value of nil. The following table shows an indication of the useful life per asset category. Categories Percentage Trade name 5% Software and other 20% ### Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at the cost price less accumulated depreciation and, if applicable, less impairments. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is based on linear depreciation over the expected period in use and taking the expected residual value into account. Depreciation commences on the date an asset comes into use. The following table shows an indication of the assessed useful economic life and depreciation percentages applied to the different fixed asset categories. Categories Percentage Buildings 2% - 3% Leasehold improvements 5% - 10% Parking equipment and installations 10% - 20% Other tangible fixed assets 10% - 20% Tangible fixed assets are capitalised if the economic ownership is held by the Company, and its Group companies, or is governed by a financial lease agreement. The qualification of a financial lease agreement is based on the contract duration, cumulative amounts of lease payments and other contract-specific conditions that indicate economic ownership. The commitment arising from the financial lease agreement is accounted for as a liability. The interest included in the future lease instalments is charged to the financial result over the term of the financial lease agreement. Periodic major maintenance is capitalised according to the components approach with which the aggregate expenditures are allocated to the component parts. ### Participating interests and prepaid expenses Participating interests in which significant influence can be exercised are valued based on the equity method by applying the Q-Park Holding B.V. valuation and accounting policies. It is presumed that significant influence can be exercised when Q-Park Holding B.V. has 20% or more of the voting rights in the General Meeting of Shareholders. If the valuation according to the equity method of a participating interest comes out negative, this is valued at zero. A provision is recognised if and insofar as, in this situation, Q-Park Holding B.V. is fully or partially liable for the debts of the participating interest or has the firm intention to guarantee its participating interest's liabilities. The first valuation of acquired participating interests is based on the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the moment of acquisition. ----- Participating interests in which no significant influence can be exercised are classified as financial instruments and stated at fair value. The prepaid expenses are valued at amortised cost. ### Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets with respect to tax-deductible losses and temporary valuation differences are recognised and are valued at the tax rates expected to apply in the future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if and to the extent that sufficient fiscal benefit is expected as compensation or if sufficient deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary taxable differences are available. Deferred tax assets and liabilities will be offset against each other if these fall within a tax group for corporate tax and as far as the periods in which settlement is expected coincide. ### Receivables On initial recognition, receivables are valued at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The fair value and amortised cost equal the face value. Provisions deemed necessary for possible bad debt losses are deducted. These provisions are determined by individual assessment of the receivables. ### Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand, and are valued at face value. If cash is not freely disposable, this has been taken into account on valuation. ### Provisions Provisions are made if Q-Park Holding B.V. has a present obligation (contractual or actual) resulting from a past event. A provision is only recognised insofar as a reliable estimate of the liability can be made and it is probable that such a liability will have to be paid. However, the exact size and timing of the outgoing cash flow is uncertain. The expenses associated with a provision are recognised in the income statement. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the provisions will be discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds as at balance sheet date. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs reflect the least net costs of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it, and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. As the time value of money is material to the provision it is discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds. Deferred tax liabilities The deferred tax liabilities with respect to temporary differences between the tax base and commercial valuation of assets and liabilities are stated at nominal value and based on the tax rates against which these differences are expected to be settled in the future. ----- Pensions In relation to pension benefits the Group makes use of the provision to (integrally) apply the IFRS standards on pension benefits. Within the Group there are a variety of pension schemes in accordance with the conditions and practices prevailing in the countries in which the Group operates. The schemes qualify as defined contribution plans under which contributions are paid into pension funds or to insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except for paying these contributions, the Group has no other obligations to pay further contributions by virtue of these plans. Premium liabilities are charged to the result at the moment the liability arises and no provisions are made for future increases of pension premiums. ### Non-current liabilities Lease obligations Long-term liabilities arising from financial lease contracts are stated in the balance sheet at the discounted value, only insofar as they are fixed, irreversible liabilities. This discounted value is determined based on the incremental borrowing rate for these liabilities. The interest expenses related to these liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Loans On initial recognition, loans are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The costs of concluding loans, prepaid interest charges and financing charges are deducted from the loan and are charged to the result according to the effective interest method over the duration of the loans. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a debt instrument and allocating the interest income over the relevant period. Repayments within a year after balance sheet date are presented as a separate item as part of the current liabilities. ### Financial instruments Q-Park Holding B.V. uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) such as interest rate swaps (IRS) and interest rate caps (IRC) to hedge against the risk of changing interest rates. Financial derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are valued at their fair value at every subsequent balance sheet date. Hedges relate to the risk of possible variability of cash flows attributable to a recognised asset, or obligation, or an expected transaction, or the currency risk of an off-balance obligation for which a contract has been undertaken. Movements in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of the line item ‘financial result’. ### Current liabilities On initial recognition, current liabilities are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost (which is usually in line with the nominal amount). ### Determining the result Costs are determined in accordance with the accounting policies defined and are allocated to the appropriate reporting year. Profits are reported in the year in which the services are provided. Losses are recognised in the year in which they are known. ----- ### Revenue recognition Net revenue represents amounts invoiced for services supplied during the financial year, net of discounts and value added taxes. Revenue is recognised based on the service delivered to the customer till balance sheet date. The costs of providing these services are allocated to the same period. The revenue recognised consists of: ### I Parking revenues: revenue from short-stay parking and season tickets at parking facilities operated by the Group. ### I Control fees: income arising from enforcement of paid parking (parking fines) on or in parking facilities owned by the Group and/or by third parties. ### I Management fees: the fixed and variable allowance for operating parking facilities for third parties. I Rental income: rent from parking facilities owned by the Group but operated by third parties, as well as income from renting specific areas in parking facilities to third parties. ### I Other revenues: all other income not included in the categories above. Gains resulting from the disposal of tangible fixed assets or participations are accounted for when all major entitlements to economic benefits as well as all major risks have transferred to the buyer. ### Financial result The financial result consists of both the financial expenses as well as the financial income. Interest costs on loans and interest rate derivatives, as well as amortised refinancing costs are accounted for under financial expenses. Interest income on outstanding cash and cash equivalents is accounted for under financial income. ### Taxes Corporate income tax is calculated at the applicable rate on the result for the financial year, taking into account permanent differences between profit calculated according to the financial statements and profit calculated for taxation purposes. The current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period including changes regarding taxes to be paid in respect of previous years. ### Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The funds in the cash flow statement consist of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can be considered to be highly liquid investments. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at an estimated average rate. Exchange rate differences concerning finances are shown separately in the cash flow statement. Corporate income taxes, interest received and dividends received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. Interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. The cost of Group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of Group companies acquired is presented separately in the reconciliation of the net cash flow and in the balance sheet movement of the cash position. ----- Issuance of share capital is presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Transactions that do not result in exchange of cash and cash equivalents, such as entering into a financial lease, are not presented in the cash flow statement. Lease instalment payments for financial lease contracts are presented as repayment for the repayment component and as interest paid for the interest component. # 3 Acquisitions On 4 April 2022, the Group acquired 100% of Dansk Parkerings Service A/S and ASTA ApS, a small parking operator and control fee business in the city of Randers (Denmark). The acquisition price of the shares (including acquisition costs) amounted to EUR 7.6 million (in cash only). In Q-Park, the acquisition is accounted for based on the ‘purchase accounting’ method. The goodwill resulting from the transaction amounts to EUR 3.4 million. The goodwill depreciation term is set at 10 years and is derived from the estimated contract duration of the underlying parking and control fee contracts. The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition date was as follows: (x EUR million) NON-CURRENT ASSETS TOTAL EQUITY 4.2 Intangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets 4.8 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Provisions 0.5 CURRENT ASSETS CURRENT LIABILITIES Receivables 0.5 Liabilities 0.6 Cash and cash equivalents TOTAL ASSETS 5.3 TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 5.3 ----- # 4 Intangible fixed assets Movements in the goodwill and other intangible fixed assets are shown in the table.

Though the coronavirus pandemic continued to impact our financial performance in early 2022, this impact was less severe and restrictions were eased sooner than the assumptions included in our cash flow projections. Based on the steep recovery of mainly our STP revenues, performance improved rapidly and by April 2022 our like-for-like STP revenues were back at the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Based on this stable performance in 2022 and current developments there are no indications that goodwill should be impaired. Goodwill at balance sheet date has a remaining useful life of 2 to 15 years. ### Concessions Concessions relate to the cost price of (fair value at acquisition date) and subsequent investments in the concession contracts in France. Investments in concession contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis according to the ----- duration of the underlying concession contracts. The book value of the concessions includes all capital expenditure related to the underlying parking facilities. Of the total book value, EUR 46.8 million relates to concessions under construction. ### Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets mainly include the Q-Park trade name and software and can be summarised as follows: (x EUR million) 2022 2021 Trade name 54.8 58.5 Software and other 31.1 29.4 Balance as per 31 December 85.9 87.9 ----- # 5 Tangible fixed assets Movements in tangible fixed assets are shown in the table.

The Group does not hold legal title of these assets. Investments in 2022 amounted to EUR 81.3 million consisting of investments in existing facilities as well as new portfolio additions. Furthermore the total investments include the additions in parking facilities financed by means of financial lease constructions. ----- The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the lack of recovery for some locations can be an indicator of a potential impairment of the parking facilities included in the tangible fixed assets. We have therefore analysed our portfolio of individual parking facilities (cash generating units) and performed impairment tests on the parking facilities for which the 2022 performance is below expectations and for which recovery lagged behind the general trend. The value in use of these assets is based on a discounted cash flow model per asset. The cash flows used in the model are derived from current (post-pandemic) performance and growth expectations for future periods. The post-tax discount rate used for discounting the cash flows is determined per country and ranges from 6.01% to 7.13%. Though the discount rates used are based on generic company parameters, it varies per country as a result of country specific risk premiums and relevant corporate income tax rates. The impairment test performed resulted in a impairment of EUR -40.1 million (2021: EUR -1.6 million) of owned and financial leased properties. The impairment result primarily relates to facilities and locations that were already struggling before the coronavirus pandemic. Further deterioration of the areas in which these facilities are located meant they have not recovered in line with other facilities in our portfolio. As part of the corporate financing positions, the majority of corporate assets have been pledged either by mortgage or share pledges. The guarantee affects the majority of the Group with exemption of some owned assets located in Belgium, Denmark and France. # 6 Participating interests and Long-term receivables Movements in participating interests and long-term receivables are shown in the table.

(x EUR million) 2022 2021 % EUR % EUR Taxes on direct result based on domestic tax rates 25.8% 20.0 25.0% 30.2 Adjustments: Adjustments for actual Group companies rate -0.7 -2.4 Non-taxable goodwill amortisation and impairment -10.3 -10.0 Non-deductible interest expenses -4.3 -6.3 Other permanent differences -2.3 -10.4 Other adjustments -1.5 13.8 Total tax income/(expense) 1% 0.9 12% 14.9 The other permanent differences primarily relate to non-deductible other expenses consisting of non-deductible lease expenses for German trade tax purposes and shareholder management fees. In 2021 the other permanent differences also included the effect of non-valued fiscal losses in the recognition of deferred tax losses. ----- The other adjustments in 2022 mainly concern true-ups of tax positions based on the latest available tax declarations. In 2021 the other adjustments were significantly higher due to releases of deferred tax positions as a result of tax rate changes (primarily in the Netherlands) and adjustments based on the outcomes of tax audits pending in 2020. The deferred tax balances recognised in the balance sheet are detailed in the following table. (x EUR million) 2022 2021 Available tax losses carried forward 22.9 27.2 Other temporary valuation differences 57.8 53.6 Total deferred tax assets 80.7 80.8 Other temporary valuation differences 243.0 256.7 Total deferred tax liabilities 243.0 256.7 The total deferred tax losses carried forward mostly relate to available tax-deductible losses, mainly in Germany, the United Kingdom and Belgium. The recoverability of the tax-deductible losses has been assessed in the light of current performance, the updated business plan and prevailing tax regulations. For the EUR 3.6 million of available tax losses carried forward, no assets are recorded due to the uncertainty concerning recoverability. The other deferred taxable differences included in the deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary valuation differences on financial derivatives, financial leasing and provisions for onerous leases. The deferred tax liabilities mainly comprise of the temporary valuation differences between the fiscal and commercial valuation of parking facilities. The value is largely due to the fair value step-up of assets resulting from the purchase accounting of the Q-Park Group acquisition.

The Management Board of Q-Park Holding B.V. has four members. The compensation for two of the board members is paid as a service fee to the management company that employs the board members and amounts to EUR 0.1 million for the year 2022 (2021: EUR 0.1 million). The other two are unsalaried board members as their services are part of the total management fee as disclosed in note 19 'Related parties'. # 19 Related parties A related party is a person or an entity that is related to the Group. These include both people and entities that have, or are subject to, the influence or control of the Group. During 2022, the Group paid management fees to its shareholders of EUR 5.3 million (2021: EUR 5.3 million). # 20 Risk management regarding financial instruments ### Policy concerning financial risk management The policy regarding managing financial risks is determined by the Management Board. The key financial risks to which Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed are market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. Market risk can be further split into interest exposure and currency risk; these risks are closely monitored internally. Instruments for managing these risks include financial derivatives. The Company does not take speculative positions with financial instruments. ----- ### Interest exposure Interest rate fluctuations influence the direct result of Q-Park Holding B.V. The Group interest policy is designed to limit risks and can be explained as follows: ### I interest-bearing debts have a fixed interest component and a variable interest component, where the interest from the variable interest component is hedged by means of interest rate swaps (IRS) and caps; ### I overall, at least 70% of the term loan should be protected from interest rate fluctuations. At the end of 2022, loan positions were partly hedged by means of an interest rate swaps (IRS) for EUR 110.0 million (2021: EUR 110.0 million). As a result of the hedging positions in combination with the fixed rated part of the loans, 77% of the total loans (EUR 1,695.2 million) is insensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which is well above the Group's policy. The following table shows the hedging of the loan positions further specified by time to maturity of the interest rate derivatives. 2022 2021 Hedged value (x EUR million) Number of contracts Hedged value (x EUR million) Time to maturity Number of contracts Period < 5 years 1 110.0 - 5 years < period < 10 years - - 1 110.0 10 years < period < 15 years - - - Period > 15 year - - - Total 1 110.0 1 110.0 ### Currency risk Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to its activities in the United Kingdom and Denmark. This is exposure is primarily limited to a translation effect of the net investments in these countries as the operational activities take place locally and there are no cross-border activities in foreign currencies. Therefore, related revenue, costs and capital expenditure are all in the same currency. The exposure on the translation effect of the net investment not hedged. ### Liquidity risk Q-Park Holding B.V. endeavours to limit the liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of sufficient credit facilities to support the operating activities and meet financial obligations. Given the solid cash flows and balance sheet positions, Q-Park Holding B.V. has sufficient access to these facilities. The following tables indicate the time to maturity of the contractual liabilities at the close of 2022. ----- 2022 (x EUR million) < 1 year 1 to 5 years - 5 years Total Liabilities arising from loans 3.4 1,623.2 68.6 1,695.2 Lease obligations 73.7 295.2 1,620.7 1,989.6 Financial derivatives - 7.0 - 7.0 Other long-term liabilities - - 16.5 16.5 Provisions 1.5 - 47.2 48.7 Trade payables 50.7 - - 50.7 Other liabilities, accruals and deferred income 207.3 - - 207.3 Total 336.6 1,925.4 1,753.0 4,015.0 With the exception of the financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value, all items in the table are stated at face value, taking the moment of settlement into account. Liabilities arising from loans – with the exception of the local bilateral loans – will be refinanced. All other liabilities stated in the table are financed from working capital and operating cash flows. At balance sheet date, the financial lease obligations have an average time to maturity of more than ten years. ### Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its obligations arising from a financial instrument or contract with a client, causing financial damage. Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed to credit risk in connection with its operating activities (trade receivables in particular) and in connection with its financing activities, including deposits at banks and financial institutions, currency transactions, and other financial instruments. At the reporting date, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the book value of the receivables and cash and cash equivalents as explained in the respective notes. Q-Park Holding B.V. considers the credit risk to be limited. The concentration of risks concerning trade receivables is low, as the customers are widely dispersed. Assets held at the bank concern only assets at reputable banks. ### Fair value change of interest derivatives The fair value of the financial instruments is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. Relevant variables applicable to the valuation of these interest rate derivatives are the present value of interest payments and the expected interest rate curves. The total negative market value of the interest derivatives comprise of the negative market value of interest rate swaps and amount to EUR 7.0 million (2021: EUR 25.2 million). The following table shows an overview of the book value and movements of the financial derivatives, subdivided per type. ----- (x EUR million) 2022 2021 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Book value as per 1 January - -25.2 - -32.1 Movements in fair value - 18.2 - 6.9 Book value as per 31 December - -7.0 - -25.2 ### Capital management The primary objective of Group capital management is to maintain good creditworthiness and to ensure that the operating activities are optimally supported, so that these operating activities can be conducted effectively, efficiently and profitably and so that shareholder value is created. Q-Park Holding B.V. manages its capital structure and adjusts this to changes in economic circumstances. To maintain or modify the capital structure, Q-Park Holding B.V. may adjust dividend payments to shareholders, repay capital or issue new shares. ----- ## C O M P A N Y B A L A N C E S H E E T A S P E R 3 1 D E C E M B E R 31 December (x EUR million, before result appropriation) Notes Financial fixed assets 2022 31 December 2021 Participating interests 23 442.0 502.9 Intercompany receivables 24 105.7 105.7 547.7 608.6 Current assets Intercompany receivables 24 10.1 13.8 Other receivables, prepayments and accrued income - 10.1 13.8 Cash - TOTAL ASSETS 557.8 622.4 ----- 31 December 2021 (x EUR million, before result appropriation) Notes Shareholders' equity 31 December 2022 Paid-up and called-up capital 25 - Share premium reserve 25 913.7 913.7 Translation reserve 25 -21.7 -21.1 Other reserve 25 -341.8 -236.1 Result financial year 25 -57.7 -105.7 492.5 550.8 PROVISIONS Deferred tax liabilities - 11.0 - 11.0 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Shareholder loan 26 52.7 52.7 52.7 52.7 Current liabilities Liabilities to shareholder 26 10.5 6.9 Intercompany liabilities 2.1 1.0 12.6 7.9 TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 557.8 622.4 ----- ## C O M P A N Y P R O F I T A N D L O S S A C C O U N T (x EUR million) Notes 2022 2021 Company result 2.6 2.6 Share in result of participating interests 23 -60.3 -108.3 Result after taxes -57.7 -105.7 ----- ## N O T E S T O T H E C O M P A N Y A N N U A L A C C O U N T S # 21 General information Q-Park Holding B.V. (chamber of commerce number: 68805934) has issued notices of liability in respect of all consolidated Dutch legal entities pursuant to Book 2, Section 403 of the Dutch Civil Code. A statement of the legal entities for which a parent guarantee is submitted is stated in the note on Group companies and participating interests. # 22 Accounting policies observed when preparing the Company annual accounts ### General The Company-only financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The accounting policies used for the Company annual accounts are identical to those for the consolidated annual accounts. For the general principles for the preparation of the financial statements, the principles for valuation of assets and liabilities and determination of the result, as well as for the notes to the specific assets and liabilities and the results, reference is made to the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if not presented otherwise hereinafter. ### Participating interests Participating interests in Group companies and other entities where the Company may exercise control or where it has the central management are stated initially and on balance sheet date at net asset value. The value of these participating interests is corrected for the Company's share in the results of the participating interest, based on the accounting policies as these are applied in the consolidated annual accounts and for the share in other movements in the shareholders' equity of the participating interest attributable to the Company after the acquisition date. The net asset value is determined by stating the assets, provisions, liabilities and result using the accounting policies applied in the consolidated annual accounts. # 23 Participating interests Movements in the participating interests are shown in the following table. (x EUR million) 2022 2021 Balance as per 1 January 502.9 610.1 Acquisitions - Result from participating interests -60.3 -108.3 Dividends - Other movements -0.6 1.1 Balance as per 31 December 442.0 502.9 ----- The losses related to participating interest with a negative equity value and for which no provision has been recorded amounted to EUR 19.0 million in 2022. # 24 Intercompany receivables The intercompany receivables recognised under financial fixed assets concern an interest-bearing loan and borrowings issued to Group companies as part of Group financing. The interest rate for the loan is set at 7% with a term of 10 years. There are no repayment obligations during the term of the loan only on the final repayment date. The intercompany receivables recognised under current assets mainly concern current account positions with Group companies for which no further agreements have been made about the term to maturity or repayment. ----- # 25 Shareholders' equity Movements in the shareholders' equity are shown in the following table.

At the end of 2022 the difference in shareholder's equity amounted to EUR 19.0 million which is fully attributable to the losses of the related participating interests in 2022. The statutory translation reserve (exchange rate differences reserve) is a legally required reserve and therefore not freely distributable. ### Share capital The issued share capital consists of 100 shares with a nominal value of EUR 1 per share. All shares have been issued. ----- ### Statutory translation reserve The statutory translation reserve is a legal reserve and comprises the foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of foreign operations. ### Proposed appropriation of the result for the financial year 2022 By virtue of law, the loss over 2022 will be deducted from the shareholders equity with due regard to the necessary movements in the statutory reserves. # 26 Shareholder loan The shareholder loan concerns an interest-bearing loan issued by the shareholder of the Company. The interest for the loan is set at 7%. There are no repayment obligations during the term of the loan, only on the final repayment date. The accrued interest on the shareholder loan is recognised in the current liabilities. # 27 Contingencies and liabilities not included in the balance sheet The Company and its subsidiary Q-Park Holding I B.V. have reciprocally accepted joint and several liability for everything they, or any one of the borrowers, are, or shall be, liable for in respect of debts in connection with the issued bonds and RCF. In connection with this guarantee, the Company pledged the shares it holds in Q-Park Holding I B.V. and pledged all intercompany receivables from Q-Park Holding I B.V. From 22 May 2017 onwards, the Company forms a fiscal unity for Dutch corporate income tax purposes together with its direct subsidiary Q-Park Holding I B.V. and parent companies Byzantium Acquisition MidCo 1 B.V. and Byzantium Acquisition TopCo B.V. As of acquisition date, the Dutch Q-Park subsidiaries, as stated in note 31 Group companies and participating interests, are included in this fiscal unity.

The General Meeting is at liberty to appropriate profits which are determined based on the approved annual accounts and to approve distributions to the extent the shareholders' equity exceeds the reserves that must be retained according to the law. By way of derogation from the preceding sentence and in compliance with article 21.4, the Management Board is authorised to execute interim profit distributions. 2. The profit is at free disposal of the General Meeting. When calculating the amount of profit to be distributed for each share the nominal amount of the shares will be eligible regardless the amount against which the shares have been issued. 3. Distributions of profit occurs after approval of the annual accounts. Profit distributions are paid within two weeks after approval by the Management Board as specified in article 21.6, unless the Management Board decides otherwise in the event of exceptional circumstances. 4. The Management Board is at liberty, in compliance with article 21.1, to authorise interim distributions. The Management Board shall not authorise interim distributions if they are aware or should reasonably be aware that the Company cannot continue to pay its debts after payment of these distributions. 5. The General Meeting is at liberty to authorise a full or partial distribution of reserves. 6. A resolution to distribute profits or reserves cannot be executed without approval of the Management Board. The Management Board only refuses the approval of distributions if they are aware or should reasonably be aware that the Company cannot continue to pay their debts after payment of these distributions. 7. Shareholder claims for payment of distributions expire five years after approval of the distribution. 8. In calculating the amount of any distribution, any shares held by the Company shall not be included. ----- On a longer term, refinancing of existing bonds will be necessary.

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the annual accounts, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the annual accounts using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment as well as among others the integrity training, zero-tolerance policy, whistle blower policy and incident registration. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to, among others, financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets, and bribery and corruption. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due fraud is present. We identified the presumed fraud risk with respect to management override of controls and performed the following specific procedures: ### I We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. ### I We considered available information and made inquiries of the Management Board and Country Management. ### I We tested the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments made in the preparation of the annual accounts. ### I We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by Q-Park Holding B.V., particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting. ### I We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the annual accounts indicate a possibility of bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Management insights, estimates and assumptions that might have a major impact on the annual accounts are disclosed in note 2 of the annual accounts. ### I We have evaluated the impairment (indicator) testing of intangible and tangible fixed assets performed by management. Intangible and tangible fixed assets as disclosed in note 4 and 5 of the annual accounts, are significant areas to our audit as the determination whether these assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amounts is subject to management judgment and estimation. We have amongst others evaluated qualitative factors for specific facilities and actual performance versus management's expectations on parking facility and country level (retrospective review). Further, we evaluated the expected future cash flows and, where needed, we evaluated the weighted average cost of capital and long-term growth rate in close cooperation with our internal specialists. Our procedures performed did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements. ### Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations We assessed the laws and regulations relevant to the Company through discussion with Q-Park Holding B.V., reading minutes and reports of internal audit. As a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects from non-compliance could considerably vary, we considered the following laws and regulations: adherence to (corporate) tax law and financial reporting regulations, the requirements under Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with a direct effect on the financial statements as an integrated part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the related financial statements. ----- Apart from these, the Q-Park Holding B.V. is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance, through imposing fines or litigation. Given the nature of Q-Park Holding B.V.’s business and the complexity of Q-Park, there is a risk of non-compliance with the requirements of such laws and regulations. Our procedures are more limited with respect to these laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to Q-Park Holding B.V.'s ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified audit procedures to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of management and others within Q-Park Holding B.V.’s as to whether the Q-Park Holding B.V. is in compliance with such laws and regulations and (ii) inspecting correspondence to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Naturally, we remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us. ### Audit approach going concern Our responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of the Management Board, related to going concern under the prevailing standards are outlined in the “Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements” section below. In fulfilling our responsibilities, we performed procedures including evaluating management’s assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and considering the impact of financial, operational, and other conditions. Management’s conclusion on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is outlined in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The main uncertainty identified by management is linked to consumer behaviour and impact on the parking business when the general price increases result in a decrease in GDP growth and consumer spending. The results of 2022 and current economic developments in combination with the available liquidity position, gives management the comfort that the Company has sufficient means to deal with these remaining uncertainties. We have evaluated the cash balance, cash forecasts and available liquidity position (including the current financing situation) of the Company. In doing so, we note, as described in note 11, that the Company has repaid the Revolving Credit Facility (hereafter RCF) during 2022 based on the forecasted liquidity needs. With the current and forecasted financial performance the RCF is available to be redrawn by the Company if a need would arise. Furthermore, we evaluated the forecasts (including the leverage ratio) of the Company through backtesting, comparing budget to actuals for the first months of 2023 and performing sensitivity analyses. ----- On a longer term, refinancing of existing bonds will be necessary. As described on page 31, in the going concern paragraph, management has started discussions for the refinancing of the first bond tranche that is due in February 2025. Based on these procedures, we did not identify any reportable findings related to the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. ### Report on the other information included in the annual report The annual accounts contains other information, in addition to the annual accounts and our auditor’s report thereon. The other information consists of: ### I Director’s Report. I Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: ### I Is consistent with the annual accounts and does not contain material misstatements. I Contains all the information regarding the management report and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the annual accounts or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the annual accounts. Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Director’s Report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. ### Description of responsibilities regarding the annual accounts Responsibilities of management for the annual accounts Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the annual accounts, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the annual accounts using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as going concern in the annual accounts. ### Our responsibilities for the audit of the annual accounts Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others: ### I Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ### I Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of you going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. ### I Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts, including the disclosures. I Evaluating whether the annual accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit. ----- Eindhoven, 13 April 2023 As originally signed R.H.M.

The company is filed with the Trade Register at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68805934. The activities of Q-Park Holding B.V. and its Group companies primarily consist of providing off-street and on-street parking services at strategic locations. The consolidated annual accounts are drawn up by the Management Board for the year 2021 and approved on13 April 2022. All amounts are in EUR millions unless stated otherwise. Q-Park Holding B.V.'s consolidated annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. By virtue of Title 9 of Book 2, Section 402, Dutch Civil Code the company annual accounts contain an abridged profit and loss account. ### Group structure Q-Park Holding B.V. is the head of the Group of legal entities included in the consolidation. The Company's direct shareholder is Byzantium Acquisition MidCo 1 B.V. registered at the Chamber of Commerce under number 68802641. The ultimate shareholders of the Company are a consortium consisting of investment funds advised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (London, United Kingdom), Eureizen (Paris, France), PensionDanmark Pensionsforsikringsaktieselskab (Copenhagen, Denmark), Euro-Parking Investments S.a.r.l. (Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and Babylon Investments B.V. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). An overview of the Group companies and the company’s other participating interests is set out in the note on Group companies and participating interests. ### Going concern The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the related government restrictions on mobility have had a significant impact on our business and financial results. The effect of these restrictions continued during 2021 but was less severe than in the preceding year. Though our total costs base is largely fixed, we immediately reacted to protect our cash flow to the extend possible by: ### I reducing (discretionary) costs wherever possible without harming the long-term strength of our company; I making selective use of available economic stimulus and government support programmes; I ensuring a solid liquidity buffer to get through the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic is not over, the impact it has on the economy is decreasing. As per date of preparation of the annual accounts, governments in the countries in which we are active have or are releasing most of the coronavirus related restrictions. It is evident that the pandemic will have an impact on our business in the coming months as restrictions have been in place for the first months of 2022 and there still is uncertainty about the ----- development of the virus towards the winter of 2022. Based on the recovery pattern experienced in 2021 and current developments, we do expect that recovery will continue in 2022 and financial results will improve further. An additional uncertainty arose with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Though the impact of this invasion on the parking business is difficult to predict, it has already led to an increase in energy costs following increased prices of gas and oil. As the total energy costs are not a significant amount in our total cost base, the price increase itself will not have an impact on our going concern assessment. The main uncertainty is linked to consumer behaviour and impact on the parking business when the price increases result in a decrease in GDP growth and consumer spending. As of the date of preparation of the annual accounts, the risk of this impact is difficult to assess and we have not yet experienced an active decrease in average mobility. The current developments regarding the easing of restrictions, the recovery pattern experienced and the available liquidity position, at the time of approving these annual accounts, give us the comfort that the Group has sufficient means to deal with the uncertainty of the remainder of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The annual accounts 2021 are therefore prepared on the basis of going concern assumptions. ----- # 2 Significant accounting policies ### General The consolidated annual accounts and company annual accounts are presented in euros. The euro is the presentation currency as well as the functional currency of Q-Park Holding B.V. Each entity within the Group recognises transactions and balance sheet items in its own functional currency. ### Consolidation Financial information relating to Group companies and other legal entities controlled by Q-Park Holding B.V. or where central management is conducted has been consolidated in the financial statements of Q-Park Holding B.V. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles of Q-Park Holding B.V. An overview of the Group companies and the company’s other participating interests is set out in the note on Group companies and participating interests. Financial information relating to the Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation is fully included in the consolidated financial statements, eliminating the intercompany relationships and transactions. The results of newly acquired Group companies and the other legal entities and companies included in the consolidation are consolidated as from the acquisition date. On that date, the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value. If the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, this is goodwill which is capitalised and amortised over the expected useful life. ### Foreign currencies Receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are converted at the prevailing exchange rates as per balance sheet date. Foreign exchange rate differences arising are incorporated in the consolidated income statement. The income statements from Group companies registered abroad are converted at the average exchange rate for the period of the consolidated income statement. The net result from these Group companies is converted at the exchange rate prevailing at balance sheet date. The difference between these two conversions is accounted for in the shareholders' equity (statutory exchange rate differences reserve). Assets and liabilities of a Group company incorporated abroad are converted at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date for the purposes of consolidation. Foreign exchange rate differences that arise are directly deducted from or added, after deduction of deferred tax effects, to the Group equity and recognised in the statutory exchange rate differences reserve. Likewise, this also applies to the translation differences on loans that form part of the net investment in the foreign operations. ----- Overview of the exchange rates used for drawing up the annual accounts: 2021 2020 Average End Average End British pound (GBP) 1.1632 1.1901 1.1257 1.1123 Danish crown (DKK) 0.1345 0.1345 0.1341 0.1344 ### Estimates in the annual accounts When applying the Group’s accounting policies, it is necessary to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The most important of these estimates are explained as follows. At balance sheet date Q-Park Holding B.V. determines whether there are any indicators that goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and/or tangible fixed assets are impaired. If and when indicators are identified, an impairment calculation is performed and if applicable an impairment result is recognised. The provision for onerous contracts is determined based on a projection of cash flows and estimated losses. These cash flow projections and the related onerous contract provision are reassessed on an annual basis based on the actual cash flow developments of the most recent reporting period and other developments impacting the estimation. There is some uncertainty regarding the explanation of complex tax regulations and the tax effects of the acquisition and financing structure of Q-Park. Considering the wide range of international business relationships and the longrunning and complex nature of existing contractual agreements, differences may arise between the assumptions made and the actual results, or future changes in such assumptions may influence the actual results. Deferred tax assets related to unused tax losses are recognised insofar as it is probable that profit for tax purposes will be available to which this can be offset. In order to determine the value of the deferred tax assets arising from tax losses not offset, a management assessment is required regarding the probable timing and level of the future taxable profits, combined with future fiscal planning strategies. For further details on the tax positions, reference is made to note 17 'Taxes'. ----- ### Business combination The purchase accounting method is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises: ### I fair values of the assets transferred; I liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business; I equity interests issued by the Group; I net present value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values on the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share in the fair value of the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities. Acquisition-related costs are capitalised as part of the purchase price. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, adjusted for any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value against the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds at the date of exchange. A contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. ### Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets are presented at cost including all directly attributable costs less accumulated amortisation and, if applicable, less impairments in value. Amortisation is charged as a fixed percentage of cost, as specified in more detail in the notes to the balance sheet. The expected useful life and the amortisation method are reassessed at the end of each financial year. Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of between 5 to 20 years. This period is derived from the long-term business profile of the underlying acquisitions and cash flows from the operated assets (owned and leased parking facilities). Concessions The concessions relate to all investments in French parking facilities involving a (finite) concession for the use of the ground and facility. The concessions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the underlying concession contracts with an assumed residual value of nil. Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets consist of the corporate trade name and other intangible fixed assets (mainly software). The corporate trade name is capitalised as part of business combinations at fair value on acquisition date. ----- The other intangible fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life with an assumed residual value of nil. The following table shows an indication of the useful life per asset category. Categories Percentage Trade name 5% Software and other 20% ### Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at the cost price less accumulated depreciation and, if applicable, less impairments. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is based on linear depreciation over the expected period in use and taking the expected residual value into account. Depreciation commences on the date an asset comes into use. The following table shows an indication of the assessed useful economic life and depreciation percentages applied to the different fixed asset categories. Categories Percentage Buildings 2% - 3% Leasehold improvements 5% - 10% Parking equipment and installations 10% - 20% Other tangible fixed assets 10% - 20% Tangible fixed assets are capitalised if the economic ownership is held by the company, and its Group companies, or is governed by a financial lease agreement. The qualification of a financial lease agreement is based on the contract duration, cumulative amounts of lease payments and other contract-specific conditions that indicate economic ownership. The commitment arising from the financial lease agreement is accounted for as a liability. The interest included in the future lease instalments is charged to the financial result over the term of the financial lease agreement. Periodic major maintenance is capitalised according to the components approach with which the aggregate expenditures are allocated to the component parts. ### Participating interests and prepaid expenses Participating interests in which significant influence can be exercised are valued based on the equity method by applying the Q-Park Holding B.V. valuation and accounting policies. It is presumed that significant influence can be exercised when Q-Park Holding B.V. has 20% or more of the voting rights in the General Meeting of Shareholders. If the valuation according to the equity method of a participating interest comes out negative, this is valued at zero. A provision is recognised if and insofar as, in this situation, Q-Park Holding B.V. is fully or partially liable for the debts of the participating interest or has the firm intention to guarantee its participating interest's liabilities. The first valuation of acquired participating interests is based on the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the moment of acquisition. ----- Participating interests in which no significant influence can be exercised are classified as financial instruments and stated at fair value. The prepaid expenses are valued at amortised cost. ### Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets with respect to tax-deductible losses and temporary valuation differences are recognised and are valued at the tax rates expected to apply in the future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if and to the extent that sufficient fiscal benefit is expected as compensation or if sufficient deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary taxable differences are available. Deferred tax assets and liabilities will be offset against each other if these fall within a tax group for corporate tax and as far as the periods in which settlement is expected coincide. ### Receivables On initial recognition, receivables are valued at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The fair value and amortised cost equal the face value. Provisions deemed necessary for possible bad debt losses are deducted. These provisions are determined by individual assessment of the receivables. ### Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand, and are valued at face value. If cash is not freely disposable, this has been taken into account on valuation. ### Provisions Provisions are made if Q-Park Holding B.V. has a present obligation (contractual or actual) resulting from a past event. A provision is only recognised insofar as a reliable estimate of the liability can be made and it is probable that such a liability will have to be paid. However, the exact size and timing of the outgoing cash flow is uncertain. The expenses associated with a provision are recognised in the income statement. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the provisions will be discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds as at balance sheet date. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs reflect the least net costs of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it, and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. As the time value of money is material to the provision it is discounted at the market rate of high-quality corporate bonds. Deferred tax liabilities The deferred tax liabilities with respect to temporary differences between the tax base and commercial valuation of assets and liabilities are stated at nominal value and based on the tax rates against which these differences are expected to be settled in the future. ----- Pensions In relation to pension benefits the Group makes use of the provision to (integrally) apply the IFRS standards on pension benefits. Within the Group there are a variety of pension schemes in accordance with the conditions and practices prevailing in the countries in which the Group operates. The schemes qualify as defined contribution plans under which contributions are paid into pension funds or to insurance companies on a contractual basis. Except for paying these contributions, the Group has no other obligations to pay further contributions by virtue of these plans. Premium liabilities are charged to the result at the moment the liability arises and no provisions are made for future increases of pension premiums. ### Non-current liabilities Lease obligations Long-term liabilities arising from financial lease contracts are stated in the balance sheet at the discounted value, only insofar as they are fixed, irreversible liabilities. This discounted value is determined based on the incremental borrowing rate for these liabilities. The interest expenses related to these liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Loans On initial recognition, loans are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. The costs of concluding loans, prepaid interest charges and financing charges are deducted from the loan and are charged to the result according to the effective interest method over the duration of the loans. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a debt instrument and allocating the interest income over the relevant period. Repayments within a year after balance sheet date are presented as a separate item as part of the current liabilities. ### Financial instruments Q-Park Holding B.V. uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) such as interest rate swaps (IRS) and interest rate caps (IRC) to hedge against the risk of changing interest rates. Financial derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are valued at their fair value at every subsequent balance sheet date. Hedges relate to the risk of possible variability of cash flows attributable to a recognised asset, or obligation, or an expected transaction, or the currency risk of an off-balance obligation for which a contract has been undertaken. Movements in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as part of the line item ‘financial result’. ### Current liabilities On initial recognition, current liabilities are stated at fair value and then valued at amortised cost (which is usually in line with the nominal amount). ### Determining the result Costs are determined in accordance with the accounting policies defined and are allocated to the appropriate reporting year. Profits are reported in the year in which the services are provided. Losses are recognised in the year in which they are known. ----- ### Revenue recognition Net revenue represents amounts invoiced for services supplied during the financial year, net of discounts and value added taxes. Revenue is recognised based on the service delivered to the customer till balance sheet date. The costs of providing these services are allocated to the same period. The revenue recognised consists of: ### I Parking revenues: revenue from short-stay parking and season tickets at parking facilities operated by the Group. ### I Control fees: income arising from enforcement of paid parking (parking fines) on or in parking facilities owned by the Group and/or by third parties. ### I Management fees: the fixed and variable allowance for operating parking facilities for third parties. I Rental income: rent from parking facilities owned by the Group but operated by third parties, as well as income from renting specific areas in parking facilities to third parties. ### I Other revenues: all other income not included in the categories above. Gains resulting from the disposal of tangible fixed assets or participations are accounted for when all major entitlements to economic benefits as well as all major risks have transferred to the buyer. ### Financial result The financial result consists of both the financial expenses as well as the financial income. Interest costs on loans and interest rate derivatives, as well as amortised refinancing costs are accounted for under financial expenses. Interest income on outstanding cash and cash equivalents is accounted for under financial income. ### Taxes Corporate income tax is calculated at the applicable rate on the result for the financial year, taking into account permanent differences between profit calculated according to the financial statements and profit calculated for taxation purposes. The current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period including changes regarding taxes to be paid in respect of previous years. ### Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The funds in the cash flow statement consist of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can be considered to be highly liquid investments. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at an estimated average rate. Exchange rate differences concerning finances are shown separately in the cash flow statement. Corporate income taxes, interest received and dividends received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. Interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. The cost of Group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of Group companies acquired is presented separately in the reconciliation of the net cash flow and in the balance sheet movement of the cash position. ----- Issuance of share capital is presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Transactions that do not result in exchange of cash and cash equivalents, such as entering into a financial lease, are not presented in the cash flow statement. Lease instalment payments for financial lease contracts are presented as repayment for the repayment component and as interest paid for the interest component. ----- # 3 Acquisitions On 30 April 2021, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in ParkKing beheer B.V. and ParkKing exploitatie B.V. via its subsidiary Q-Park Operations Netherlands B.V. The acquisition price of the shares (including acquisition costs) amounted to EUR 1.9 million (in cash only). In Q-Park, the acquisition is accounted for based on the ‘purchase accounting’ method. The goodwill resulting from the transaction amounts to EUR 1.8 million. The goodwill depreciation term is set at 4 years and is derived from the contract duration of the parking facilities acquired. The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition date was as follows: (x EUR million) NON-CURRENT ASSETS TOTAL EQUITY 0.1 Intangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets 0.1 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Provisions CURRENT ASSETS CURRENT LIABILITIES Receivables 0.2 Liabilities 0.2 Cash and cash equivalents TOTAL ASSETS 0.3 TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 0.3 ----- # 4 Intangible fixed assets Movements in the goodwill and other intangible fixed assets are shown in the table.

The coronavirus pandemic and related mobility restrictions had a significant impact on our performance and financial results. In 2020 this impact was considered to be an indicator of a potential impairment of the book value of long-lived assets and a goodwill impairment test was performed resulting in a goodwill impairment of EUR 14.5 million that was recognised in the 2020 income statement. Though the coronavirus pandemic continued to impact our financial performance in 2021, this impact was less severe than the assumptions included in our cash flow projections that were the basis for the impairment test of 2020. Based on the performance in 2021 and current developments there are no indications that goodwill should be further impaired. Goodwill at balance sheet date has a remaining useful life of 3 to 16 years. ----- ### Concessions Concessions relate to the cost price of (fair value at acquisition date) and subsequent investments in the concession contracts in France. Investments in concession contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis according to the duration of the underlying concession contracts. The book value of the concessions includes all capital expenditure related to the underlying parking facilities. Of the total book value, an amount of EUR 36.6 million relates to concessions under construction. ### Other intangible fixed assets The other intangible fixed assets mainly include the Q-Park trade name and software and can be summarised as follows: ----- # 5 Tangible fixed assets Movements in tangible fixed assets are shown in the table.

The Group does not hold legal title of these assets. Investments in the year 2021 amounted to EUR 129,7 million consisting of investments in existing facilities as well as new portfolio additions. Furthermore the total investments include the additions in parking facilities financed by means of financial lease constructions. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and related mobility restrictions on our performance and financial results can be an indicator of a potential impairment of the parking facilities included in the tangible fixed assets when its ----- performance stays behind on expectations. We have therefore analysed our portfolio of parking facilties and performed impairment tests on the parking facilities for which the 2021 performance is below expectations. The value in use of these is assets is based on a discounted cash flow model per asset. The cash flows used in the model are derived from past performance and growth expectations including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The performed impairment test resulted in a cumulative impairment of EUR 1.6 million (2020: EUR 23.7 million) of owned and financial leased properties. As part of the corporate financing positions, the majority of corporate assets have been pledged either by mortgage or share pledges. The guarantee affects the majority of the Group with exemption of owned assets located in Denmark and France. # 6 Participating interests and Long-term receivables Movements in participating interests and long-term receivables are shown in the table.

The total nominal fixed lease obligation relating to these operational lease agreements amounts to EUR 1,688.9 million (2020[1]: EUR 1,500.3 million). Of this amount, EUR 160.2 million (2020: EUR 132.4 million) is due within one year, EUR 555.3 million (2020: EUR 453.2 million) is due between 1 to 5 years and EUR 973.4 million (2020: EUR 914.7 million) is due after five or more years.

Based on an assessment of financial risk for the claims received, provisions have been made or the financial consequences have been accounted for in the annual accounts, as far as is deemed necessary. In relation to the legal proceedings and disputes that are not included in the balance sheet, the risk of a cash outflow is assessed as highly remote. 1 The comparative figures 2020 have been adjusted to align with the classifications as included in the 2021 figures ----- # 14 Events after balance sheet date On 24 February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. As described, the impact of this invasion on our business is uncertain and linked to consumer behaviour if the direct effects of the war result in a decrease in GDP growth and consumer spending. Based on our assessments, the invasion and uncertainty do not impact the valuation of assets and liabilities as per balance sheet date. # 15 Net revenue The specification of net revenue is shown in the following table. (x EUR million) 2021 2020 Parking revenues 454.0 420.5 Control fees 23.5 21.2 Management fees 18.0 16.8 Rental income 13.2 13.9 Other revenues 17.7 16.8 Net revenue 526.4 489.2 The net revenue per country is further specified in the following table. ----- # 16 Financial result The specification of the financial result is shown in the following table.

The 2020 depreciation of capitalised transaction costs was significantly higher following the refinancing in February 2020 and the accelerated depreciation of the capitalised bank costs related to the refinanced term loan facility. # 17 Taxes The tax income/expense amounts to EUR 14.9 million (2020: EUR -0.2 million), details are shown in the following table. (x EUR million) 2021 2020 % EUR % EUR Taxes on direct result based on domestic tax rates 25% 30.2 25% 56.6 Adjustments: Adjustments for actual Group companies rate -2.4 -2.7 Non-taxable goodwill amortisation and impairment -10.0 -13.7 Non-deductible interest expenses -6.3 -9.3 Other permanent differences -10.4 -3.4 Other adjustments 13.8 -27.7 Total tax income/(expense) -12% 14.9 0% -0.2 The other permanent differences primarily relate non-deductible other expenses conisisting of non-deductible lease expenses for German trade tax puroses and shareholder management fees. In 2021 the other permanent differences also included the effect of the effect of non-valued fiscal losses in the recognition of deferred tax losses. ----- The other adjustments in 2021 as well as 2020 mainly concern releases of deferred tax positions as a result of tax rate changes in the Netherlands and true-ups of tax positions based on the latest available tax declarations and outcomes of tax audits pending in 2020. The deferred tax balances recognised in the balance sheet are detailed in the following table. (x EUR million) 2021 2020 Available tax losses carried forward 27.2 19.8 Other temporary valuation differences 53.6 52.9 Total deferred tax assets 80.8 72.7 Other temporary valuation differences 256.7 271.1 Total deferred tax liabilities 256.7 271.1 The total deferred tax losses carried forward mostly relate to available tax-deductible losses, mainly in Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium and France. The recoverability of the tax-deductible losses has been assessed in the light of current performance, the updated business plan and prevailing tax regulations. For an amount of EUR 5.0 million of available tax losses carried forward, no assets are recorded due to the uncertainty concerning recoverability. The other deferred taxable differences included in the deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary valuation differences on financial derivatives, financial leasing and provisions for onerous leases. The deferred tax liabilities mainly comprise of the temporary valuation differences between the fiscal and commercial valuation of parking facilities. The value is largely due to the fair value step-up of assets resulting from the purchase accounting of the Q-Park Group acquisition. Movements in the deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in the following table. ----- # 18 Employee information ### Employees At the end of 2021 there were 1,878 employees (2020: 1,837) corresponding to 1,581 full-time equivalents (FTEs) (2020: 1,563). Of the total headcount, 1,135 employees representing 1,005 FTEs work outside the Netherlands (2020: 1,121 employees, 1,002 FTEs). The number of employees and the number of FTEs is further specified as follows: 2021 2020 Headcount FTE Headcount FTE Netherlands 743 576 716 561 Germany 198 163 210 181 France 333 330 329 326 Belgium 35 32 35 33 United Kingdom 299 275 279 260 Ireland 43 41 47 44 Denmark 227 164 221 158 Total 1,878 1,581 1,837 1,563 ### Remuneration of the Management Board of Q-Park Holding B.V. The Management Board of Q-Park Holding B.V. has four members. The compensation to board members is paid as a service fee and amounts EUR 0.1 million for the year 2021 (2020: EUR 0.1 million). # 19 Related parties A related party is a person or an entity that is related to the Group. These include both people and entities that have, or are subject to, the influence or control of the Group. During 2021 the Group paid management fees to its shareholders of EUR 5.3 million (2020: EUR 5.3 million). # 20 Risk management regarding financial instruments ### Policy concerning financial risk management The policy regarding managing financial risks is determined by the Management Board. The key financial risks to which Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed are market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. Market risk can be further split into interest exposure and currency risk; these risks are closely monitored internally. Instruments for managing these risks include financial derivatives. The company does not take speculative positions with financial instruments. ### Interest exposure Interest rate fluctuations influence the direct result of Q-Park Holding B.V. The Group interest policy is designed to limit risks and can be explained as follows: ----- ### I interest-bearing debts have a fixed interest component and a variable interest component, where the interest from the variable interest component is hedged by means of interest rate swaps (IRS) and caps; ### I overall, at least 70% of the term loan should be protected from interest rate fluctuations. At the end of 2021, loan positions were parlty hedged by means of an interest rate swaps (IRS) for an amount of EUR 110.0 million (2020: EUR 840.0 million). As a result of the hedging positions in combination with the fixed rated part of the loans 68% of the total loans of EUR 1,936.9 million is insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. If the available cash position is netted with the variable part of the loans, the fixed rate percentage would increase to 84% which is well above the the group policy. The following table shows the hedging of the loan positions further specified by time to maturity of the interest rate derivatives. 2021 2020 Number of Hedged value Number of Hedged value Time to maturity contracts (x EUR million) contracts (x EUR million) Period < 5 years - - 2 730.0 5 years < period < 10 years 1 110.0 1 110.0 10 years < period < 15 years - - - Period > 15 year - - - Total 1 110.0 3 840.0 ### Currency risk Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to its activities in the United Kingdom and Denmark. This is exposure is primarily limited to a translation effect of the net investments in these countries as the operational activities take place locally and there are no cross-border activities in foreign currencies. Therefore, related revenue, costs and capital expenditure are all in the same currency. The exposure on the translation effect of the net investment not hedged. ----- ### Liquidity risk Q-Park Holding B.V. endeavours to limit the liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of sufficient credit facilities to support the operating activities and meet financial obligations. Given the solid cash flows and balance sheet positions, Q-Park Holding B.V. has sufficient access to these facilities. The following tables indicate the time to maturity of the contractual liabilities at the close of 2021. 2021 (x EUR million) < 1 year 1 to 5 years - 5 years Total Liabilities arising from loans 3.4 1,247.9 705.1 1,956.4 Lease obligations 75.7 302.9 1,719.6 2,098.2 Financial derivatives - - 25.2 25.2 Other long-term liabilities - - 17.4 17.4 Provisions 0.3 - 21.6 21.9 Trade payables 59.6 - - 59.6 Other liabilities, accruals and deferred income 178.8 - - 178.8 Total 317.8 1,550.8 2,488.9 4,357.5 With the exception of the financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value, all items in the table are stated at face value, taking the moment of settlement into account. Liabilities arising from loans – with the exception of the local bilateral loans – will be refinanced. All other liabilities stated in the table are financed from working capital and operating cash flows. At balance sheet date, the financial lease obligations have an average time to maturity of more than ten years. ### Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its obligations arising from a financial instrument or contract with a client, causing financial damage. Q-Park Holding B.V. is exposed to credit risk in connection with its operating activities (trade receivables in particular) and in connection with its financing activities, including deposits at banks and financial institutions, currency transactions, and other financial instruments. At the reporting date, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the book value of the receivables and cash and cash equivalents as explained in the respective notes. Q-Park Holding B.V. considers the credit risk to be limited. The concentration of risks concerning trade receivables is low, as the customers are widely dispersed. Assets held at the bank concern only assets at reputable banks. ### Fair value change of interest derivatives The fair value of the financial instruments is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. Relevant variables applicable to the valuation of these interest rate derivatives are the present value of interest payments and the expected interest rate curves. ----- The total negative market value of the interest derivatives comprise of the negative market value of interest rate swaps and amount to EUR 25.2 million (2020: EUR 32.1 million). The following table shows an overview of the book value and movements of the financial derivatives, subdivided per type.

Q-Park Holding B.V. manages its capital structure and adjusts this to changes in economic circumstances. In order to maintain or modify the capital structure, Q-Park Holding B.V. may adjust dividend payments to shareholders, repay capital or issue new shares. ----- ## C O M P A N Y B A L A N C E S H E E T A S P E R 3 1 D E C E M B E R ----- ----- ## C O M P A N Y P R O F I T A N D L O S S A C C O U N T ----- ## N O T E S T O T H E C O M P A N Y A N N U A L A C C O U N T S # 21 General information Q-Park Holding B.V.

The accounting policies used for the company annual accounts are identical to those for the consolidated annual accounts. For the general principles for the preparation of the financial statements, the principles for valuation of assets and liabilities and determination of the result, as well as for the notes to the specific assets and liabilities and the results, reference is made to the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if not presented otherwise hereinafter. ### Participating interests Participating interests in Group companies and other entities where the company may exercise control or where it has the central management are stated initially and on balance sheet date at net asset value. The value of these participating interests is corrected for the company's share in the results of the participating interest, based on the accounting policies as these are applied in the consolidated annual accounts and for the share in other movements in the shareholders' equity of the participating interest attributable to the company after the acquisition date. The net asset value is determined by stating the assets, provisions, liabilities and result using the accounting policies applied in the consolidated annual accounts. ----- # 23 Participating interests Movements in the participating interests are shown in the following table.

In our opinion the accompanying annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of Q-Park Holding B.V. as at 31 December 2021, and of its results for 2021 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The annual accounts comprise: 1. The consolidated and company balance sheet as at 31 December 2021. 2. The consolidated income statement and company profit and loss account for 2021. 3. The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information. ### Basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ""Our responsibilities for the audit of the annual accounts"" section of our report. We are independent of Q-Park Holding B.V. in accordance with the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ### Emphasis of the impact of the current economic uncertainties The current economic uncertainties caused by the Russia/Ukraine-crisis and the coronavirus pandemic also impacts Q-Park Holding B.V. Management disclosed the uncertainty on financial performance and health of Q-Park Holding B.V. and her plans to deal with these events or circumstances in note 1 of the annual accounts. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. ### Report on the other information included in the annual report In addition to the annual accounts and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: ### I Directors Report. I Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: ### I Is consistent with the annual accounts and does not contain material misstatements. ### I Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the annual accounts or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the annual accounts. ----- Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Directors Report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code ### Information in support of our opinion We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the annual accounts as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters. ### Audit approach fraud risks We have identified and assessed risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity, its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the management’s process for identifying and responding to the risk of fraud in the entity. This also includes the monitoring of internal controls and how the Management Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as among other the integrity policies, supporting policies, whistle blower procedures and incident registration. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated possible fraud risk factors with respect to, among others, financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets, bribery and corruption. We have conducted this evaluation in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We specially evaluated whether these factors indicate a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We identified the presumed fraud risk with respect to management override of controls and performed the following specific procedures: ### I We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or noncompliance. ### I We evaluated available documentation and made inquiries of Board of Directors, Executive Management and Country Management which were led by our forensic specialists. ### I We tested the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and the other adjustments made in preparation of the annual accounts. ### I We have evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group, particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting. ### I We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the annual accounts indicate a possible bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Management insights, estimates and assumptions that might have a major impact on the annual accounts are disclosed in note 2 of the annual accounts. ### I We have performed impairment (indicator) testing of intangible and tangible fixed assets. Intangible and tangible fixed assets as disclosed in note 4 and 5 of the annual accounts, are significant areas to our audit as the determination whether these assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amounts is subject to management judgment and estimation. We have amongst others evaluated actual performance versus management's expectations on parking facility and country level (retrospective review). Where needed we evaluated expected future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital and long-term growth rate in close cooperation with our internal specialists. ----- Our procedures performed did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements. ### Description of responsibilities regarding the annual accounts Responsibilities of management for the annual accounts Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the annual accounts, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the annual accounts using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the annual accounts. ### Our responsibilities for the audit of the annual accounts Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.: ### I Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ### I Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. ### I Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ### I Concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our ----- opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. ### I Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts, including the disclosures. ### I Evaluating whether the annual accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and Eindhoven, 13 April 2022 As originally signed R.H.M. Hermans Deloitte Accountants B.V. performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,605
